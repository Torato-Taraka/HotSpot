Sure these aren’t wooden sticks?” said a user.They also expressed concerns for his female counterpart, using a hashtag “We want Panda Lin Hui to come home”.“The countries that rent giant pandas can keep them if they raise them well, or else they should send them back,” said Ningbo Ni Shao, a local media outlet.The Chinese consulate in Chiang Mai, a city in northern Thailand, released photos on their website Wednesday of Chinese and Thai officials mourning Chuang Chuang, placing flowers by a framed photo near the zoo’s entrance. ", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "URL": "https://mb.com.ph/2019/09/19/panda-death-in-thailand-stirs-suspicion-in-china/", "MainKeyWord": "China", "AdditionalKeyWord": "Thailand", "Source": "MB"}
