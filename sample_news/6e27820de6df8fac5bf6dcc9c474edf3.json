He has reached the level of a Formula One driver by his own strength, not because of his name,” said Domenicali.“Now we have to give him time to grow, to learn… and to follow a normal progression curve.”", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "URL": "https://mb.com.ph/2021/03/25/spotlight-on-schumacher-as-famous-name-returns-to-formula-one/", "MainKeyWord": "Macao", "AdditionalKeyWord": "Southeast Asia", "Source": "MB"}
