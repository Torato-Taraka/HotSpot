More than 4,200 people have died globally and over 115,000 have been infected during the pandemic, according to CNN's tally.  China's National Health Commission has confirmed the virus, which causes a disease known as Covid-19, can be transmitted from person to person through \"droplet transmission\" -- where a virus is passed on due to an infected person sneezing or coughing -- as well as by direct contact.  In mainland China, more than 80,700 cases of the virus and over 3,100 deaths have been recorded -- the vast majority in Hubei province, ground zero for the outbreak.   There are more than 35,000 confirmed cases of the virus in over 100 countries and territories outside mainland China.  At least 1,120 people have died outside of mainland China from the virus.
