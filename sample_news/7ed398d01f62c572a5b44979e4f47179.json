Anyone caught with more than 600 grams (21 ounces) of heroin or more than 20 kilograms of opium could face the death penalty.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "URL": "https://mb.com.ph/2018/02/26/vietnam-cops-seize-2-5-million-heroin-in-china-border-drug-bust/", "MainKeyWord": "China", "AdditionalKeyWord": "viet Nam", "Source": "MB"}
