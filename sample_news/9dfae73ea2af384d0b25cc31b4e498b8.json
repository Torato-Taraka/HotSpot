{"Type": "article", "Time": "2020-09-07", "Headline": "September 8 coronavirus news", "Text": "Trick-or-treating will not be allowed in Los Angeles County this Halloween due to the risk of spreading the coronavirus, according to new guidance from the local health department. “Door to door trick or treating is not allowed because it can be very difficult to maintain proper social distancing on porches and at front doors especially in neighborhoods that are popular with trick or treaters,” the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health said in a news release.  “Trunk or treating” events where children trick-or-treat from cars are also not allowed.  Under the guidance, gatherings or parties with non-household members are prohibited even when conducted outdoors. Carnivals, festivals, live entertainment, and haunted house attractions are also prohibited. The county’s public health department is encouraging alternative ways to celebrate Halloween this year, including online parties and car parades that comply with public health orders. Individuals must remain in their vehicles during these drive-thru events. As the nation’s most populous county with over 10 million residents, Los Angeles County remains in the first tier of the state’s four-tiered reopening system.  To date, Los Angeles County has reported a total of 249,241 Covid-19 cases and 6,036 deaths. San Diego State University (SDSU) in California has confirmed nearly 400 Covid-19 cases among students since the first day of fall semester, according to data from the university’s website. “On Sept. 6, San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA) confirmed additional COVID-19 cases within the on- and off-campus student population, bringing the total of four (4) probable and 396 confirmed cases,” SDSU said on its website. All in-person instruction was immediately paused last Friday after the university confirmed 120 positive cases, in addition to 64 cases previously reported since the start of fall semester on August 24.  The university has not received any reports of faculty and staff who have tested positive. San Diego County is currently in the second tier of the state’s four-tiered reopening system, which represents “substantial” spread of the coronavirus. Under this tier, indoor businesses may reopen with 25% capacity. ##Hotspots## ##Schools## Mexico’s Health Ministry reported 5,351 new Covid-19 infections on Tuesday and 703 new virus-related deaths. That brings the country’s total number of confirmed cases to 642,860 and at least 68,484 fatalities.  Mexico has reported the world’s fourth-highest number of coronavirus deaths, behind the United States, Brazil and India respectively, according to Johns Hopkins University.  The country is listed eighth by JHU in terms of the highest total number of coronavirus cases.   ##Hotspots## The US Food and Drug Administration would use a different standard to approve a Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use than it would for a treatment like convalescent plasma, Dr. Mark McClellan, a professor of business, medicine and policy at Duke University said Tuesday. Standards for emergency use approval of a vaccine would be much higher, said McClellan, a former FDA commissioner. Convalescent plasma is \"a treatment where we've seen it used in many, many other conditions and in literally thousands of patients with serious Covid infections. It’s intended for people who are hospitalized or seriously ill, not for a broad, healthy population,” McClellan said during the Research! America 2020 Summit. “Because there are not very many safety concerns, it's a different kind of standard.” McClellan said that the FDA and other agencies have plans in place to ensure transparency in the development of a Covid-19 vaccine, including review by an independent advisory committee, data reported from the vaccine makers, review by FDA staff and public discussion. “The FDA has made clear in its guidance that a vaccine is not going to be approved, even for emergency use, unless there is a clear clinical signal that it meets that standard of effectiveness,” he said.   ##Vaccines## Ibaneis Rocha, the governor of Brazil’s Federal District where the capital Brasilia is located, has tested positive for Covid-19, CNN affiliate CNN Brasil reported, citing his press team.   The diagnosis was reported late Tuesday, and according to his press team, Rocha showed mild Covid-19 symptoms. Rocha has a low fever and cough, CNN Brasil reported.   Rocha will remain isolated at home for the next few days and will continue to work remotely. It comes as Brazil’s Health Ministry reported 14,279 new Covid-19 infections and 504 new virus-related deaths on Tuesday. ##Politics## Brazil’s Health Ministry reported 14,279 new Covid-19 infections and 504 new virus-related deaths on Tuesday. That brings the country’s total number of cases to 4,162,073 and raises the death toll to 127,464. Brazil has recorded the third-highest coronavirus case numbers in the world, behind the United States and India.  In terms of coronavirus deaths, Brazil has the second-highest number of fatalities, after the US. ##Hotspots##   President  Trump made his third visit to North Carolina in as many weeks on Tuesday, pushing a new end-in-sight message on coronavirus. Whether the situation on the ground there helps him is an open question; the state still has a mask requirement in place, and many businesses — including bars and movie theaters — remain closed. But the President did not wear a mask during his speech in Winston-Salem. And while many supporters visible in stands directly behind Trump were wearing masks, most individuals higher up on the stands away from Trump and most supporters on the ground in front of Trump's podium were not sporting masks. Before Tuesday's event, the Republican chairman of the local county commission said the President should wear a mask during his speech, a virtually unimaginable prospect for a President who has been mocking his rival for wearing one and who demanded reporters remove their face coverings when asking him questions on Monday. \"The President of the United States sets the example for everybody else. You can hear it: if the President of the United States says I don't have to wear it, I'm not going to wear it. And I can guarantee you that will be done,\" said David Plyler, the chairman of the Forsyth County Board of Commissioners. Keep reading. The state of Connecticut has added four states — Delaware, Maryland, Ohio, and West Virginia — to its travel advisory list. \"They have a higher infection rate, which is the criterion we have for whether you can fly in without quarantining or not,\" Gov. Ned Lamont explained to CNN's Wolf Blitzer. \"We're a small state, we're a region that's got a very low infection rate. And so far we've been at less than 1% for over three months. We want to keep it that way.\" Amid the Covid-19 global pandemic, Connecticut joined neighboring New York and New Jersey in a regional approach to protecting against the virus. Lamont pointed to air travel as a key component in this strategy. \"They fly into Kennedy [International] Airport, they fly into LaGuardia [Airport,] they drive up here to Connecticut. And it makes sense for us to do this together,\" the governor told the host of CNN's \"The Situation Room.\" \"Obviously Newark International Airport gets people from all over the world. It made good sense for us to do this.\" Meanwhile, on the first Tuesday after Labor Day, Lamont noted the challenges facing children as they look to return to the classroom. \"We've opened up our schools. Many of them full-time, some of them on a hybrid basis. These kids hadn't been to school for many months,\" he said.  \"We're going to do this, but we're going to do it very, very carefully,\" he said of the educational plan, adding \"we're going to walk before we run.\" As the number of Covid-19 deaths continues to rise, Lamont assured his state is taking every precaution to keep kids and their teachers safe. \"Look, we're requiring the masks, we've got all the toughest disinfecting standards,\" he said. \"Some of those school districts that are a little more crowded, they only have half days or half classes just to spread people out.\" Testing “as many people as possible” is vital to helping fight the coronavirus pandemic, 11 directors of some of the various National Institutes of Health said Tuesday. Their joint blog post contradicts recently changed guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which indicates that not everyone who believes they have been exposed needs to be tested.  “Get tested if you believe you have been in contact with someone with COVID-19,” the NIH heads write in the blog post. “Testing, particularly of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals, is key to interrupting this spread.” CDC guidance about testing was changed last month to indicate that not everyone who has been near or with someone with coronavirus needs to be tested. A senior federal health official told CNN this was because of pressure from the Trump administration. “Unfortunately, there still is a lot of confusion about where to get a test and who should get tested,” the NIH directors said. “It is becoming clear that for a person to test positive, they have to have a significant amount of the virus in their system. This means that if you have no symptoms but think or were told that you were in contact with a person with COVID-19, you should isolate yourself immediately, call your health care provider, and then get a test.” Testing is the cornerstone of the basic public health approach for controlling disease outbreaks: contact tracing. “Testing can help people determine if they are infected with SARS-CoV-2 – regardless of whether they have symptoms – and whether they are at risk of spreading the infection to others. Taking measures to prevent the spread of infection will be the most effective strategy for getting us safely back to work and school,” the directors wrote. Those signing the blog post include the directors of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development; the National Library of Medicine; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; National Institute of Mental Health; National Institute on Aging; National Institute of General Medical Sciences; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities; NIH Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research; National Institute of Nursing Research; and the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Gov. Asa Hutchinson announced today that Arkansas is using $4 million to purchase 120,000 antigen tests.  Hutchinson said that the state had joined a multi-state purchasing agreement led by the Rockefeller Foundation partnered with the National Governors Association. \"The Department of Health has worked very diligently with our procurement team to follow up on this commitment and today I am pleased to announce that we are using 4 million dollars to purchase 120,000 antigen tests to be used throughout the state as a result of this multi-state purchasing agreement, that is our commitment. This will not require any state funds since this will be using CARES Act funding already approved for testing,\" Hutchinson said in the news conference.  Hutchinson also reported that Arkansas recorded 294 additional Covid-19 cases in the past 24 hours. He also said the state has 409 Covid-19 hospitalizations, which is an increase of 10, and nine additional Covid-19 deaths, for a total of 917. Remember: These numbers were released by the Arkansas public health agency, and may not line up exactly in real time with CNN’s database drawn from Johns Hopkins University and the Covid Tracking Project.   Drug giant AstraZeneca said Tuesday it had paused a trial of its coronavirus vaccine because of an unexplained illness in one of the volunteers. It’s a standard precaution in vaccine trials, meant to ensure experimental vaccines don’t cause serious reactions among volunteers. “As part of the ongoing randomized, controlled global trials of the Oxford coronavirus vaccine, our standard review process triggered a pause to vaccination to allow review of safety data,�� the company said in a statement sent to CNN. “This is a routine action which has to happen whenever there is a potentially unexplained illness in one of the trials, while it is investigated, ensuring we maintain the integrity of the trials,” the statement added.  “In large trials, illnesses will happen by chance but must be independently reviewed to check this carefully. We are working to expedite the review of the single event to minimize any potential impact on the trial timeline. We are committed to the safety of our participants and the highest standards of conduct in our trials.” Earlier Tuesday, AstraZeneca joined eight other companies in signing a pledge promising they would not seek premature government approval for any coronavirus vaccine. They promised they would wait until they had adequate data showing any potential vaccine worked safely to prevent infection. The AstraZeneca vaccine is one of three coronavirus vaccines in late-stage, Phase 3 trials in the US. It was not immediately clear if the pause involved only US trial sites or all of the company’s trial sites around the world. A Data and Safety Monitoring Board usually monitors trials for adverse events and can order a pause or halt to a trial, but AstraZeneca did not say who had stopped the trial. An AstraZeneca spokesperson later said the illness affected a participant in Britain, but said all of the company’s trials of the vaccine globally would be paused. ##Vaccines##   British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will announce new measures on Wednesday to reduce the number of people legally allowed to socially gather from 30 to six in England to control the coronavirus spread. The new lower limit, due to take effect starting Monday, will make it easier for police to identify and disperse illegal gatherings of more than six people unless it meets one of the exemptions. Exemptions include, a household or support bubble larger than six, if gatherings are for work or education purposes, weddings, funerals, or organized team sports. “We need to act now to stop the virus spreading. So we are simplifying and strengthening the rules on social contact – making them easier to understand and for the police to enforce,” Johnson said in a statement. “It is absolutely critical that people now abide by these rules and remember the basics – washing your hands, covering your face, keeping space from others, and getting a test if you have symptoms.” The statement added the new measures are supported by the government, Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty and Chief Scientific Adviser Patrick Vallance after the UK has seen the number of daily coronavirus cases rise to almost 3,000. On Tuesday, Britain recorded an increase of 2,460 new coronavirus cases in the past 24 hours, bringing the total number of cases to 352,560. Colorado will launch a partnership with Apple and Google to allow for Covid-19 exposure notifications on cellphones for contact tracing in an effort to slow the spread of the virus, Gov. Jared Polis announced Tuesday. \"We want to use every tool in the toolbox to contain the virus and limit community spread,\" Polis said during a news briefing. The technology, called EN Express Opportunity, will roll out at the end of September. It will be available for iOS users who opt-in to use the service, and for Android users as an app.   Using Bluetooth technology, the service or app will exchange anonymous tokens between phones of people who've been within a certain distance of each other, according to Sarah Tuneberg, director of the Colorado Coronavirus Innovation Response Team. If a person using the service or app has been near someone who tests positive for coronavirus, the person will receive a push notification about exposure to the virus. People who are using the service and test positive for the virus need to report it.  Both Polis and Tuneberg both emphasized no personal information is obtained from users.   \"Data security and privacy are of the utmost importance to us. This is a completely anonymized service that contains no personal health information,\" Tuneberg said.   The University of Iowa Athletics Department has announced it is resuming voluntary and mandatory student-athlete workouts. Eight days ago, the university had halted all sports programs after reporting 93 positive Covid-19 tests within the athletics community. In the most recent testing period of Aug. 31-Sept. 6, Iowa reports 21 positive tests and 276 that were negative. As a member of the Big 10 football conference, Iowa’s fall football season was postponed last month by the conference’s Council of Presidents and Chancellors, which cited health and safety concerns related to coronavirus. ##Schools## The University of Tennessee is having a “significant issue” with a small portion of its study body, particularly fraternities, in combating the spread of Covid-19 on campus, University Chancellor Donde Plowman said Tuesday in her coronavirus livestream.  Plowman detailed the disturbing reports of irresponsible behaviors that had been reported stemming from the fraternities.  “Fraternities leaders communicating to houses how to have parties and avoid being caught, avoid the police. Stories of a fraternity renting space off campus to have their party, crammed with lots of people in close quarters. Telling fraternity members not to get tested or how to get tested so the results aren’t shared with the university,” Plowman said.  What the numbers look like: The school reported 600 active Covid-19 cases, 592 of which are among students, eight are among employees, and a total of 2,112 people— 1,939 of whom are students — are now in quarantine or in isolation.  “Our case counts are going up way too fast and we will need more drastic measures to stop the upward trajectory,” Plowman said, adding that the school will need more isolation spaces over time, and is in the process of creating more of that space.  Plowman said that the school was considering a range of options for enforcement, and that “everything is on the table at this point.” She promised additional announcements on specifics in the days ahead.  ##Schools## Covid-19 has interfered with care and prevention efforts for other diseases around the world, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Tuesday. “Unfortunately, it’s been disruptive across the board, not only in the United States but globally,” Fauci said during the Research! America 2020 Summit. People are missing screening for things “that you need to pay attention to,” such as breast cancer and prostate cancer. And they’re missing follow-up appointments for other conditions.  “You can wind up getting into a situation where diseases that have nothing to do with Covid, diseases of different types, infection, cancer, autoimmune, inflammatory, they might get neglected and routine checkups that you would need tend to get neglected,” he said. Fauci said that it is known in the HIV community that disruption of services and availability of drugs can really be a problem. “Bottom line is, it’s quite disruptive and has deleterious effects on how we handle other diseases,” he said.   More than 513,000 US children have been diagnosed with Covid-19, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children’s Hospital Association. The groups found that 70,630 new child cases were reported from Aug. 20 through Sept. 3. This is a 16% increase in child cases over two weeks, bringing up the total to at least 513,415 cases, the groups said in their weekly report on pediatric coronavirus cases. “These numbers are a chilling reminder of why we need to take this virus seriously,” said American Academy of Pediatrics President Dr. Sally Goza. “While much remains unknown about COVID-19, we do know that the spread among children reflects what is happening in the broader communities,” she added. “A disproportionate number of cases are reported in Black and Hispanic children and in places where there is high poverty. We must work harder to address societal inequities that contribute to these disparities.”  Children represent nearly 10% of all reported cases in the US, according to the report. The child cases are likely underreported because the tally relies on state data that is inconsistently collected. “This rapid rise in positive cases occurred over the summer, and as the weather cools, we know people will spend more time indoors,” said Dr. Sean O’Leary, the vice chair of the AAP Committee on Infectious Diseases.  “Now we are heading into flu season. We must take this seriously and implement the public health measures we know can help. That includes wearing masks, avoiding large crowds, and maintaining social distance. In addition, it will be really important for everyone to get an influenza vaccine this year. These measures will help protect everyone, including children.”    Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Tuesday he is cautiously optimistic that a vaccine will be proven safe and effective by the end of the year. But he said that’s unlikely to happen by Election Day.  President Trump has said he thinks a Covid-19 vaccine could be ready by Election Day, Nov. 3, but Fauci said this is unlikely. “The only way you can see that scenario come true, is if there are so many infections in the clinical trial sites that you get an efficacy answer sooner than you would have projected,” Fauci said during an event sponsored by Research! America. “It's unlikely that we'll have a definitive answer at that time,” he added. “More likely by the end of the year.” There are currently three vaccine candidates in large-scale, Phase Three clinical trials in the US. “You have a lot of candidates in play, which really is the reason why we're optimistic that we will be successful with one or more, and that will likely start taking place by the end of the calendar year 2020,” said Fauci. ##Vaccines## People can hope for a mild flu season like that just experienced in the southern hemisphere, but they need to get vaccinated, too, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Tuesday. “One of the things we can say is that we should continue to encourage people to get vaccinated with the influenza vaccine,” Fauci said during an event sponsored by Research! America.  Australia had “one of the lowest rates of influenza infection in memory,” Fauci said. “If we can do that, I think that would be very favorable,” he added. “If what happened in the southern hemisphere happens here, that would be a very good and favorable thing,” Fauci added.  Mask use, social distancing and hand washing have not only helped prevent the spread of coronavirus, but they likely helped stop the spread of flu, too, he said. If the US does have what Fauci calls a “full-blown” flu season without getting control over the coronavirus, doctors, hospitals and others will struggle to tell the two infections apart. Plus, the sheer number of sick people could overwhelm the healthcare system.  “That’s the reason why, when you have two coexisting infections during the winter months, it becomes problematic,” he said.  To increase the supply of remdesivir for the treatment of Covid-19 in the United States, Rep. Lloyd Doggett, a Democrat from Texas, and the consumer advocacy organization Public Citizen are calling for President Trump to let generic drug makers produce the drug.  Gilead, the California company that makes remdesivir, has exclusive rights to sell the drug in the US. The situation is different in other countries.  “There are manufactures in India and Pakistan and the United Kingdom that have been safely producing generic remdesivir in over 100 countries. Unfortunately, we’re not one of them,” Doggett said during a virtual news conference hosted by the advocacy groups PrEP4All Collaboration, Public Citizen and Social Security Works. “We could quickly expand the supply if Trump would belatedly exert some leadership,” Doggett added. About the supply in the US: About 38 hospitals in 12 states have reported shortages of remdesivir since July, according to a report by Public Citizen. Doctors on the call expressed concern over shortages of remdesivir in the US. “We do not have enough remdesivir nationally,” said Dr. Rochelle Walensky, chief of infectious diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital, and a CNN medical analyst. “There simply is not enough of it to go around.  Dr. Thomas Patterson, chief of infectious diseases at UT Health San Antonio, said his hospital faced shortages of remdesivir during a surge of Covid-19 in August. “We received enough remdesivir to treat less than a third of the admitted patients — so a really woefully inadequate supply,” Patterson said. US hospitals do not directly purchase remdesivir the way they do other drugs. Because there isn’t enough to go around, the US Department of Health and Human Services regularly ships remdesivir to states, which then deliver the drugs to hospitals. Colleges and universities should try their best to isolate students infected with Covid-19 on campus rather than sending them home, so that they don’t infect other students or take the virus home with them, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Tuesday. With students coming from all over the country, colleges and universities can be especially important in spreading the virus, Fauci said during an event sponsored by Research! America. “You send them back to their community, you will in essence be reseeding with individuals who are capable of transmitting infection, many communities throughout the country,” Fauci said. “So it’s much, much better to have the capability to put them in a place where they could comfortably recover.” Colleges and universities are handling Covid-19 in different ways, he said, with some going completely online. Several he has spoken with are testing everybody once, the first time they come onto the campus, so that they start off with a baseline. Then they are doing surveillance testing at various intervals. “The ones who are doing that and who have the capability of handling students who ultimately get infected seem to be successfully being able to open,” he said. Colleges that cannot sequester students tend to be doing much more virtual or online teaching. K-12 schools are much more of a local issue, Fauci said. The prudent approach, he said, is to decide how to reopen depending on whether the community is in a green, yellow or red zone. Green zone schools are able to open for in-person teaching with “relative impunity” as long as they are able to identify and make accommodations for infected students. Yellow zone schools have to be able to adjust and adapt, doing things like modifying the schedule. In red zone schools “you really better be very careful before you bring the children back because you don’t want to create a situation where you have a hyper-spreading event, as you might have in the school,” he said. ##Schools## Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, today discussed the importance of letting people know what’s going on with development and approval of Covid-19 vaccines.   “We've got to regain the trust of the community about when we say something is safe and effective, they can be confident that it is safe and effective,” he said. He said it’s important to engage communities in vaccine education, including with public service announcements broadcast on radio and television as well as in-person efforts. “That's with PSAs, that's with getting out into the community yourself, boots on the ground, speaking to people, getting them involved,” Fauci said during an event organized by Research! Amerca. “It is not an easy process, but it is definitely worthwhile.” Fauci added that it’s important that more minority people are included in the clinical trials for Covid-19 vaccines.  “We want to make sure that when we say that something is safe and effective, we mean it's safe and effective for everyone,” he said.   ##Vaccines## The governing body for soccer in North America has announced that it is rescheduling qualifying games for the 2022 FIFA World Cup that were slated for this fall.  The Confederation of North, Central American, and Caribbean Association Football, also known as CONCACAF, said first-round qualifiers scheduled for October and November will now be played in March of 2021.  “Many parts of the region continue to have very challenging public health situations, and that has been a key factor in this decision,” CONCACAF said in a statement Tuesday. “Additionally, several countries across the confederation have travel restrictions and quarantine requirements, which would make international football involving 30 national teams extremely difficult.” CONCACAF will provide a new 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifying schedule after consulting with FIFA, the global governing body for soccer. There are at least 6,308,741 cases of coronavirus in the US, and at least 189,323 people have died, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. So far on Monday, Johns Hopkins has recorded 8,119 new cases and 115 reported deaths. The totals include cases from all 50 states, the District of Columbia and other US territories, as well as repatriated cases.  ##Hotspots## House Speaker Nancy Pelosi slammed Senate GOP leaders for their plan to move later this week on a scaled-down coronavirus stimulus package.  “What they have is so meager that it insults the intelligence of the American people,” Pelosi said Tuesday during an interview with Bloomberg TV. What is this about: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is proposing a $500 billion measure, about half the size of Republicans’ initial offer. The bill is not expected to receive the 60 votes needed to pass, as Democrats are likely to oppose it. Democratic leaders have called instead for a $2 trillion relief package. Pelosi alleged the bill is an attempt to give vulnerable GOP senators some political cover. “It’s only to check the box so some of his endangered Republican senators can go home and say, ‘Well, see I tried.’ But it isn’t trying. It’s not even an attempt to do the right thing, and Mitch McConnell knows that because he has to satisfy those Republicans in his caucus who don’t want to spend one more dollar,” said Pelosi.  “Get serious. Get real, Mitch McConnell,” she added. She said Republicans should negotiate among themselves to come to some consensus on how to move forward, noting that the new GOP plan differs from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s proposal to Democratic leaders. “They are in disarray,” Pelosi said. She also claimed Republicans “don’t believe in science, and they don’t believe in governance.”  But Pelosi projected confidence on a separate front that Republicans and Democrats will move to keep the government funded ahead of a Sept. 30 deadline. “We’ll come to agreement on that, I feel quite certain,” she said. She said she believes it would be hard for President Trump to veto a clean continuing resolution.  “It’s not in anybody’s interest for the government to be shut down. It is to be avoided at all costs,” Pelosi said.  ##Economy## Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont spoke candidly about his state's shutdown and struggle to obtain supplies during the early days of the pandemic while taking part in a panel today at the Yale School of Public Health. \"At that point, you had 50 governors scrambling,\" Lamont said, describing planes landing with ordered personal protective equipment, then taking off to another place with a higher offer. The governor also described the days leading up to initial shutdowns in the United States, and the realization that Connecticut would not receive supplies promised by the federal government. Lamont remarked on a speech by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo at the National Governors' Association meeting in early 2020, where Pompeo warned against making deals with China. Lamont described the speech as foreshadowing his realization that the federal government was not in control of supply chains for personal protective equipment. \"There was no supply down in Washington, DC. You probably heard, 'Don't worry, the cavalry's on the way,'\" Lamont said. \"There was nothing there.\" Lamont added he had to convince his constituents that the virus was a matter of life or death. \"I could not just order people, 'Wear the mask, stay safe, stay home, or else I'm going to arrest you,’\" said Lamont. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Tuesday that 64,550 classrooms in NYC public schools have been inspected for ventilation issues and 96% have passed. Ventilation inspections are completed in all 1,485 public school buildings, according to the mayor. “Work will continue on the classrooms that need a little more to be done before school opens,” said de Blasio at his news conference. “There is time, obviously, to make the improvements.” New York City Schools Chancellor Richard Carranza said a total of 10 buildings need repairs across the board. The city is working to get them “up to par” before the start of school on Sept. 21. Staff at those buildings will be temporarily working from home, said Carranza.  “Any repairs that aren’t complete by the first day of full time teaching and learning with not be used. It’s a simple as that,\" he said. The “Learning Bridges” free childcare program announced by the mayor earlier this summer will have access for 30,000 students starting Sept. 21 for children taking part in the hybrid learning program.   The city will prioritize those who have the greatest need for pre-K-8 children. Seventy percent of families considered high priority will have access by the end of September, according to de Blasio, and 100,000 seats will be available by December. ##Schools## The Senate will vote Thursday on a procedural motion to advance the GOP's scaled-down Covid stimulus bill, a Republican leadership aide told CNN. Here's where the votes stand: The $500-billion measure would need 60 votes to advance, but is not expected to reach that number because of broad Democratic opposition to the bill, which they say is too small. Republican leaders are hoping to get at least 51 GOP votes so they can tout the measure would have passed If not for Democrats filibuster of the relief.   But for Republicans up for re-election, especially those in tight races, being able to vote for more stimulus will be an important signal to their voters that they tried to act, even if the bill falls short. ##Economy## New York will publicly disclose a Covid-19 \"report card\" for every school in the state, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday.  “Every school district has to report every day to the department of health as to how many tests were taken, what type of test, what was the result,” and all that information will be available online, he said.  The state will keep track of the data provided by the school district, local health department, and lab that does the testing. He is signing an executive order today to ensure this data is collected. The governor demonstrated the platform and what will be available including the following:  Positive cases by date of student and staff by school and school district\nWhether that school district is remote, in person or hybrid\nThe number of students and staff on-site\nThe percentage of on-site students and staff who test positive\nThe number of tests being administered by the school, the test type, the lab used and lag time\nThe date of the last submission and update. As K-12 schools reopen with a bevy of combinations from remote, to hybrid, to in-person learning, Cuomo said its “imperative” to track the infection rate by school and district to determine potential spread. Cuomo said parents and teachers are still nervous, and the school plans are only as good as their implementation. ##Schools## As college students begin their fall semester, all 50 states have now reported positive cases of Covid-19 at colleges and universities.  This represents more than 37,000 cases of Covid-19 among students and staff at colleges and universities across the country.  These numbers represent cases that CNN has reported so far. There are likely many others, and this total will continue to be updated. One thing to note: Many schools update their data every few days, or even once a week in some cases, so there can be a lag in data.  ##Schools## The New York Department of Health will require colleges to notify the state when they have 100 Covid-19 cases and could be required to transition to remote learning, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday. The governor said in New York that SUNY Oneonta, Cornell University, University at Buffalo, Hofstra University, SUNY Oswego, Colgate University and SUNY Fredonia have all seen outbreaks. “That’s all across the state, that’s the entire state, that goes from Long Island all through Upstate.” “So this is going to be a problem, I am telling you that,” he added. Meanwhile, Cuomo cited a large gathering in Washington Square park in New York City this weekend allegedly involving New York University students, and called out the school administrators and city police for not stepping in.  “Frankly NYU security didn’t do anything about it, local police didn’t do anything about it.” NYU this weekend said in a statement it was investigating. ##Schools## The priority for New York going forward to is to “protect the progress we’ve made,” Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday.  The infection rate is .96%, he said, adding that New York reported 5 deaths Monday.  The state of New York is “stable everywhere” he said adding a caveat that the most recent data should be taken grain of salt as its holiday number.  The governor said Tuesday the state is entering a “post-Labor Day phase,” where “people start to get back to work, schools are opening, activity is increasing.” He said notably traffic is starting to increase, with more road traffic than public transportation leading to “longer commutes” the state is encouraging people to take public transportation. Cuomo said “flu season is going to be a complicated factor” due to “more stress on the testing system.” He said also because the symptoms can be comparable to Covid-19. The governor said the state's priorities are to watch schools, bar non-compliance, and secure voting. “Colleges are a problem, and will continue to be a problem,” the governor added. “This is an entirely new enterprise in an entirely new world,” he said of K-12 schools opening. “It’s something that we have to be very careful about.” The state continues to watch non-compliance in bars. The State Liquor Authority and Police Task Force observed nearly 5,000 establishments over Labor Day weekend and found 37 to be in non-compliance. Vermont Gov. Phil Scott said in a news conference that a strong testing system and contact tracing are key to keeping schools and the economy open. “Even though we are by far the safest state in the nation with the lowest number of cases and the lowest positivity rates, we know there will be bumps in the road and there will be cases tied to schools,” Scott said. “We also know how important this is for our kids and we’re here to work with schools as we take this step forward, to respond to and contain cases just as we have done throughout this pandemic.”  “As we heard from pediatricians throughout the summer, last year’s remote learning affected our kids - and not in a good way,” Scott said. “And now the work begins to see just how deep those impacts were.”  Some context: Today is the first day of school for many students in the state, with many going back to in-person school full-time while others have a combination of in-person and online schooling.  ##Schools## Stay-at-home orders — which led to people spending more time in their homes and reducing the amount they traveled — seem to be associated with a reduction in spread of Covid-19, according to new research published Tuesday in the journal JAMA Network Open. “These findings suggest that stay-at-home social distancing mandates, when they were followed by measurable mobility changes, were associated with reduction in Covid-19 cases,” said the researchers, from the Department of Geography at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.  The researchers used location data from more than 45 million cell phones between March 11 and April 10 to work out daily travel distance and time spent at home across all 50 states. These factors were used to look at the degree to which social distancing mandates were followed, and the association between mobility and Covid-19 cases. “Implementation of stay-at-home social distancing policies were associated with human movement changes,” the researchers said. “That is, people generally reduced their daily travel distances and increased their home dwell time.” Their results “suggest that stay-at-home orders were associated with reduction of the Covid-19 pandemic spread and with flattening the curve.” The research also found that case increase rates in the five states with the highest level of infection at the time — New York, New Jersey, Michigan, California and Massachusetts — slowed down after the stay-at-home orders were implemented. In states where confirmed cases increased faster people generally reduced the distance they were traveling daily quicker, and the results suggest that in states with higher case increase rates, the amount of time people spent at home was longer. Remember: The research does have some limitations, including the fact that other control measures — such as mask wearing — could have played a part in the reduction of cases.  Tuscaloosa, Alabama, Mayor Walt Maddox has ordered bars to reopen today after being shut down since Aug. 24. The executive order issued by the mayor mandates bars can reopen in a limited capacity allowing for 50% occupancy and cannot exceed 100 people. Alcohol will also only be allowed for seated customers. \"As a result of our combined efforts [with the University of Alabama], the average number of daily cases, and the overall positivity rates in our community are declining. Although far from over, this positive trend provides an opportunity for a limited reopening of bars which have sacrificed a great deal to protect our healthcare system and economy,” said Mayor Maddox in a statement.   What the numbers look like: On Friday, The University of Alabama reported 858 new cases between Aug. 28 and Sept. 3 among students and staff. Since the beginning of the school year, the institution has reported 1,910 cases.  According to the Alabama Department of Public Health data, there has yet to be a steady decline in positive cases in Tuscaloosa.   “We expected higher testing numbers at UA until the impact of the bar closures and the moratorium on campus social events could make a difference,” said Dr. Richard Friend, Dean of the College of Community Health Sciences at the University of Alabama in a statement. “We are starting to see the results of those decisions.” ##Hotspots## ##Schools## ##Reopening## The pharmaceutical company Inovio plans to begin a Phase 2/3 clinical trial of its Covid-19 vaccine candidate this month, according to company president and CEO Dr. Joseph Kim. “We’re a few months behind some of the early leaders in the Phase 3 trials, but we feel the positive attributes of our DNA vaccine will provide a great alternative in terms of safety and product stability and efficacy,” Kim told CNN Senior Medical Correspondent Elizabeth Cohen. How it works: Inovio's vaccine technology works by delivering particles of DNA directly into cells, triggering an immune response to the novel coronavirus inside the cells. The Phase 2/3 clinical trial was first announced in August on an earnings call. Inovio plans to enroll 6,000 to 10,000 volunteers in the study. That’s less than the 30,000 volunteers who are being enrolled in clinical trials for several other Covid-19 vaccine candidates. Kim said the trial will be smaller than others because they’ll be targeting high-risk people, such as factory workers. In August, Inovio shared results of small a Phase 1 clinical trial involving 40 volunteers. Side effects were mild, and the vaccine showed evidence of neutralizing antibodies and T cell responses. The data has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed medical journal. Inovio’s Covid-19 vaccine is being funded, in part, by the US Department of Defense, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations. The company has not received funding from Operation Warp Speed, the Trump administration’s initiative to fast-track the development and delivery of a Covid-19 vaccine. Three Phase 3 trials have already started in the US. Two other companies are also scheduled to begin Phase 3 trials this month, according to Moncef Slaoui, chief adviser of Operation Warp Speed. Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline expect to start a Phase 3 trial in the US by the end of the year. ##Vaccines##  Officials in Hartford, Connecticut, gave more information about the cyberattack against city systems this weekend, but did not announce a definitive start date for schools.  On Saturday, more than 200 of Hartford's 300 servers experienced a ransomware cyberattack, according to Mayor Luke Bronin.  At this time, no private or personal data has been stolen, and the city's information technology service, Metro Hartford Innovation Services, is working to restore government systems, he said. Bronin said this is one of the most significant cyberattacks on the city in the last five years.  The city's school bus routing service was one of the most heavily impacted systems the school district experienced, Bronin said. While they originally thought the system would be online and ready to go by this morning, it became clear last night that it was not the case.  The student information system Power School was also compromised in the attack, but was fully restored as of midnight last night, said Dr. Leslie Torres-Rodriguez, the superintendent of Hartford Public Schools. She also noted that Innovation Services is checking every desktop at each school to make sure they are not compromised.  Torres-Rodriguez said they are not sure when school will officially start but will keep families updated on their progress.   Police are investigating the attack and are in communication with the FBI on the matter, said Hartford Police Chief Jason Thody. While some public safety services were impacted, there were no issues with 911 calls or dispatch, he said.   Bronin noted that due to investing in half a million dollars in cybersecurity services last year, the attack had a smaller impact than it could have.  ##Schools##   Dr. Stephen Hahn, commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration, said in a Twitter thread on Tuesday that he will be using the social media platform as a way to highlight the work the FDA is doing around a Covid-19 vaccine.   He said that through Twitter and other venues, the agency will continue to “underscore that only science and data will drive FDA’s decisions,” adding that FDA staff will only authorize or approve a vaccine if it meets the high safety and efficacy standards expected by Americans. While the agency is committed to expediting work around the vaccine, the FDA will not cut corners and have not lost sight of its responsibility to ensure that decisions related to all medical products, including vaccines, are based on science and data, he said. Hahn tweeted that the FDA has made it clear through guidance what data needs to be submitted to meet regulatory standards, something he called “particularly important” as many people have expressed concerns about vaccine development efforts. The FDA is also committed to an evaluation process that’s as transparent as possible, with an FDA advisory committee of independent experts meeting in October to publicly discuss vaccine development, Hahn tweeted. He encouraged Twitter users to follow the hashtag #FDAVaccineFacts as the agency highlights different parts of the development and evaluation process.  ##Vaccines## Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris told CNN affiliate WISN that she would trust a vaccine under President Trump, if “the public health professionals and the scientists told us that we can trust it,” dropping the clause she has previously used that she would not trust a vaccine under Trump. Asked by WISN she would trust a vaccine under Trump, Harris first answered, “I pray we have a vaccine as quickly as possible that is approved by the scientists and the public health professionals.” Pressed again, she said this: “I would trust a vaccine if the public health professionals and the scientists told us that we can trust it.” On Sunday, Harris wouldn’t clearly answer CNN’s Dana Bash whether she would in fact take a vaccine if produced before Election Day. Harris instead said she wouldn't trust Trump as a credible source of information on a vaccine.  “I will say that I would not trust Donald Trump and it would have to be a credible source of information that talks about the efficacy and the reliability of whatever he's talking about,” Harris said Sunday. “I will not take his word for it. He wants us to inject bleach. No, I will not take his word.”  Those comments drew criticism from both the GOP and President Trump, who called on her to apologize.  Yesterday, her running mate Joe Biden, when asked a similar question said if he could get a vaccine, he'd take it tomorrow, even if it cost him the election. ##Vaccines## Pennsylvania restaurants can increase their indoor capacity to 50% beginning Sept. 21, the governor said Tuesday. Gov. Tom Wolf is requiring restaurants to commit to complying to public health safety guidelines by submitting through a self-certification process. Restaurants must complete the online self-certification by Oct. 5. Starting Sept. 21, restaurants with alcohol sales will stop those sales at 10:00 p.m. local time, Wolf's office said in the release. ##Reopening## Texas Gov. Greg Abbott issued a proclamation extending the Disaster Declaration for all counties in the state in response to Covid-19. The extension was signed on Monday. The original proclamation was issued on March 13 and has been renewed on a monthly basis since.  \"Renewing this Disaster Declaration helps ensure that we have the resources and strategies in place to help communities across Texas respond to COVID-19,\" Abbott said in a statement. \"I urge Texans to take precautionary steps to protect their health by wearing a mask, social distancing, and sanitizing their hands. Working together, we will slow the spread and keep our communities safe.” The US has recorded more than 6.3 million cases of the virus since the pandemic began earlier this year, according to the latest tally from Johns Hopkins University.  But today — the day after Labor Day in the US and the unofficial start of fall — some hallmarks of fall and other businesses are starting to reopen.  Here's a look at some of the things that are reopening this week or recently opened their doors again: Schools: Many students across the country are are going back to today. Sixteen of the nation's largest 101 districts are starting the school year today, including those in Chicago, Houston Independent School District and Dallas Independent School District. Of the 16 districts, 14 of them are beginning their year entirely online. One district — Cyprus-Fairbanks in Texas — is opening either all online or all in-person, with parents choosing which plan they'd like, and another one — Charleston, South Carolina — is opening with a hybrid plan.\nProfessional football: The National Football League will have its season opener on Thursday, when the Kansas City Chiefs will beginning their Super Bowl title defense against the Houston Texans. Last month, the Chiefs announced it was is planning to have approximately 22% of Arrowhead Stadium’s 76,000 seats filled for the opener.\nMovies: Last week, AMC said that 70% of its theaters — or 420 total — would be open by this weekend, including the first AMC theater in San Diego, California. The weekend also saw the release of \"Tenet,\" which brought in an estimated $20.2 million domestically this weekend.  ##Reopening## ##Schools## Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced that he will introduce the new Republican scaled-back stimulus plan on Tuesday, acknowledging the bill does not have everything that Republicans want in it.  “It does not contain every idea our party likes,\" McConnell said in a statement. \"I am confident Democrats will feel the same. Yet Republicans believe the many serious differences between our two parties should not stand in the way of agreeing where we can agree and making law that helps our nation.\" What happens next: A procedural vote to bring up the plan could happen as soon as this week, McConnell said. 60 votes would be needed to overcome the Democratic filibuster and advance the proposal, and the plan is far short of securing the necessary votes.  CNN also reported earlier this morning that Republicans privately acknowledge they have not yet won the backing of 51 of their members for their party’s stimulus proposal.  This comes after McConnell offered a $1 trillion dollar plan in July, but Republicans were badly divided over that proposal and he never brought that plan up for a vote. ##Economy## Hartford Public Schools in Connecticut said it has postponed the opening of schools for both in person and online learning today, citing a ransomware virus that caused an outage of critical systems within the network infrastructure. In a statement posted on their official website, officials note that the system in part communicates transportation routes to the bus company “and it is preventing our ability to operate schools on Tuesday.” “Everyone at Hartford Public Schools was ready to welcome back our beautiful and capable students in person and remotely. We will provide updates when we have additional information to share.” Officials are working to restore the system. ##Schools## Airlines saw about a third of the traffic they did last year over the long Labor Day weekend, according to numbers from the Transportation Security Administration.   The agency said it screened 4.1 million people this Labor Day weekend, from Thursday through Monday. That averages to about 36% of the 11.3 million people screened on Labor Day weekend in 2019.   Monday fell short of the agency’s prediction that it would screen 1 million people. It saw 935,000 travelers. Friday was the busiest day during the pandemic, when 969,000 people were screened. The vaccine developers involved in the pledge to maintain high ethical standards for vaccines felt the need to reiterate their commitment to high ethical standards and scientific processes, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said on NBC’s Today show on Tuesday. “With increasing public concerns about the processes we are using to develop these vaccines, and even more importantly, the processes that will be used to evaluate these vaccines, we saw it as critical to come out and reiterate our commitment that we will develop our products, our vaccines, using the highest ethical standards and the most scientific [rigorous] processes,” Bourla said. The nine vaccine makers said they will stand with science, at a time when the world is looking to science — in particular to a vaccine — to help bring us to the end of the pandemic, Bourla said.  “The only rival here is the virus, and the time to get the vaccine to this,” Bourla said. He called the pledge between nine vaccine makers “historic” and “an unprecedented moment.” ##Vaccines## South Africa’s economy shrank by 17.1% in the second quarter of 2020, as it felt the devastating impact of the economic shutdown due to the coronavirus pandemic. In late March, the government shut down non-essential businesses for five weeks to curb the spread of coronavirus; it has since taken a gradual approach to reopening the economy. Mining and manufacturing were among the worst-hit industries, with only agriculture showing any growth in Q2.  South Africa has seen one of the worst declines in GDP globally according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).  The country had already entered recession in the first quarter of the year, and has now seen four consecutive quarters of economic decline. ##Economy## Nine biopharmaceutical companies have signed an unusual pledge to uphold \"high ethical standards,\" suggesting they won’t seek premature government approval for Covid-19 vaccines.  The pledge, released on Tuesday, states: \"We, the undersigned biopharmaceutical companies, want to make clear our on-going commitment to developing and testing potential vaccines for COVID-19 in accordance with high ethical standards and sound scientific principles.\" The companies that signed up to it are: AstraZeneca, BioNTech, Moderna, Pfizer, Novavax, Sanofi, GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson and Merck. The pledge comes just about a week after US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn said the agency could consider emergency use authorization or approval for a Covid-19 vaccine before critical Phase 3 trials are complete. The nine companies on Tuesday wrote that they pledge to \"Only submit for approval or emergency use authorization after demonstrating safety and efficacy through a Phase 3 clinical study that is designed and conducted to meet requirements of expert regulatory authorities such as FDA.\" Pfizer and Moderna have vaccines in late-stage, Phase 3 clinical trials in the United States; Johnson & Johnson is preparing to start one. ##Vaccines## As the UK sees a rise in coronavirus cases, officials are warning that \"people have relaxed too much.\" The United Kingdom recorded 2,988 new Covid-19 cases in a 24-hour period on Sunday -- the highest daily number since May. Another 2,948 new cases were reported on Monday.   Deputy Chief Medical Professor Jonathan Van Tam said the rise in cases was \"of great concern.\"  Speaking to the BBC, Van Tam said that although people had been able to \"relax a bit over the summer,\" with disease levels low following lockdown, \"these latest figures really show us, as much as people might like to say, 'Oh well it’s gone away' -- it hasn’t gone away.\" \"People have relaxed too much, and now is the time for us to re-engage and realize that this is a continuing threat to us,\" he warned.  \"Don't kill your gran\": Health experts and officials have directed many of their warnings towards young people.  \"The rise in the number of cases we've seen over the last few days is largely amongst younger people … under 25's – especially between 17 and 21,\" Health Secretary Matt Hancock said in an interview with LBC radio on Monday, adding the rise has been most noticeable among “more affluent, younger people”. He said even though younger people are at lower risk of dying from Covid-19, there is a risk that they could infect other people. In an interview with Sky News, Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick warned young people who are \"out enjoying themselves\" to exercise caution \"particularly when they go home and see their elderly relatives.\" Hancock echoed a similar sentiment, telling BBC Radio 1's Newsbeat's listeners: \"Don't kill your gran by catching coronavirus and then passing it on.\" But some have complained that the government's messaging has been confusing.  In August, the UK government ran an \"Eat Out to Help Out\" scheme encouraging people to use restaurants, cafes and pubs -- which some say undermines efforts to curtail the virus.  And Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been encouraging people to return to work since May. UK universities are also set to resume classes soon -- despite Hancock's comments that students going back to university are a \"concern.\" \"For ministers and universities to rely on the behaviour of students, rather than deploying the public health infrastructure needed to control the virus, is a complete shirking of their own responsibility,\" Jo Grady, general secretary of the University and College Union, said in a statement.  \"Students have been told to move, live, study and socialise together,\" Grady added. \"It is totally unacceptable for Matt Hancock to try and suggest that they will be at fault for any second wave.\" Pfizer and BioNTech are confident they can have a vaccine against the novel coronavirus ready for regulatory approval by the middle of October, BioNTech CEO and co-founder Ugur Sahin has told CNN.  \"It has an excellent profile and I consider this vaccine ... near perfect, and which has a near perfect profile,\" Sahin said in an exclusive interview with CNN. He added that the company's \"understanding of the mode of action, in combination with the safety data coming in from the running trial\" meant that they have \"a lot of confidence\" in it.  \"Yes, we believe that we have a safe product and we believe that we will be able to show efficacy,” he said.  Sahin told CNN he believes that approval for emergency use will be granted quickly by regulatory authorities.  US drug giant Pfizer and German firm BioNTech say they plan to provide 100 million doses of their vaccine candidate, BNT162, by the end of the year, and up to 1.3 billion doses in 2021. Watch: ##Vaccines## As Spain struggles to reign in the fastest growing Covid-19 infection rate in Europe, it's grappling with how to ensure safety in classrooms this September, even as some schools in Madrid have been forced to delay the start of school by several days or even weeks. Spain became the first country in western Europe to reach half a million confirmed coronavirus infections on Monday, and recorded its highest daily case count since May on Friday. In order to stop the spread in schools, the country's government laid down the rules at the end of August: All students aged six and above must wear masks in class; class sizes are to be reduced; students are to be kept in assigned \"bubbles\" to prevent them mixing; desks must be positioned at least 1.5 meters apart; all schools must improve open-air ventilation, and provide hand disinfection stations. The new Covid-19 regulations, however, risk widening the gap between rich and poor, by exacerbating the disparity between private and public schools -- especially in the hardest-hit neighborhoods of Madrid. Read the full story here   Getting a flu shot is a safe, inexpensive way to stay healthy.  But in a typical year, less than half of Americans get the vaccination (just 45% last year). Rates in the United Kingdom are comparable, where just 44.9% of registered patients ages 6 months to 64 years old got a flu vaccination from 2018 to 2019. In the European Union, which committed in 2009 to vaccinate at least 75% of residents ages 65 and older, only 45% of people in that group received vaccines in 2018.  The number is even lower for people of color, who have been especially vulnerable during the pandemic. In the 2017 to 2018 flu season, just 28.4% of Hispanic people in the United States got vaccinations against influenza.  With the Covid-19 pandemic spreading rapidly around the globe, distributing the flu vaccine takes on new urgency, according to medical experts.  \"Since hospitals and doctors' offices are going to be very busy caring for Covid-19 patients, a flu vaccine can help decrease burdens on the health care system and make sure that those who need medical care are able to get it,\" said Dr. Susan Bailey, president of the American Medical Association and an immunologist in Fort Worth, Texas. It's not just to free up resources for Covid-19 patients, though.  \"Influenza is a deadly disease in its own right,\" Bailey said. And because flu symptoms -- including fever, sore throat and cough --  look so similar to Covid-19 symptoms, it will be impossible to rule out a coronavirus diagnosis without a test. That means a case of the flu, even if it turns out to be mild, can cause substantial disruption to work and school. Read the full story: ##Vaccines## Ahead of Labor Day this year, health officials warned that how Americans chose to ring in the unofficial start of fall could shape what the next months in the country's battle against Covid-19 will look like. The holiday crowds mark the unofficial end to a devastating summer across the country, with Covid-19 infections surging to more than 6.3 million and deaths topping 189,000. Experts have offered a grim prediction on what the fall and winter could look like, with the pandemic stacking up against flu season and new fronts opening up, including schools and college campuses.  \"We're heading into a more difficult season,\" Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the former US Food and Drug Administration commissioner said on CBS' Face the Nation.\n\"We're heading into the fall and the winter, when we would expect a respiratory pathogen like a coronavirus to start spreading more aggressively than it would in the summer time.\" New challenges ahead: With cooler weather ahead, it's likely many of the gatherings that have already been taking place -- many against experts' advice -- will now move indoors, where health officials have said the virus can spread more easily. Masks: Months into the pandemic, safety measures like face masks remain a point of contention nationwide -- despite experts' projections that more mask-wearing could mean thousands of lives saved by the end of the year. Campuses and schools: With tens of thousands of students back on campus, institutions are facing massive challenges. Covid-19 cases in colleges have been linked back to activities including athletics, off-campus gatherings and Greek life. Read the full story: ##Schools## Officials in Hong Kong said they are discussing a potential travel bubble with 11 countries, as the territory is set to relax social distancing measures on Friday.  Hong Kong Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Edward Yau said five or six nations have shown an interest, including Japan and Thailand. Other countries discussed for the travel bubble are South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, Germany, France, Switzerland, Vietnam, Malaysia and Singapore.  Yau said that travelers within the bubble might be required to take a coronavirus test before departure and upon arrival, and could be limited to visit a few tourist attractions with quotas. Cases ease: Hong Kong reported six new Covid-19 cases in the past 24 hours, three of which were were locally transmitted. This is the lowest number of daily cases announced since a third wave of the virus hit the city in July.  ##Reopening## Chinese President Xi Jinping said China acted in an \"open, transparent, and responsible manner\" in its handling of the coronavirus pandemic.  Xi made the comments while awarding medals to four people for their outstanding contributions during the pandemic at a ceremony today in Beijing.  Among the four were the country's top respiratory disease expert, Zhong Nanshan, according to Chinese state broadcaster CCTV.  \"We quickly established a national epidemic information release mechanism, seeking truth from facts, and publishing epidemic information in an open and transparent manner,\" Xi said. \n\"We, in an open, transparent, and responsible manner, actively fulfilled our international obligations.\" Xi said China reported information on the virus \"at the earliest time possible\" to the World Health Organization \"and relevant countries, regions and organizations.\" \"China is the first major economy to resume growth after the heavy blow of Covid-19, and is leading the world in virus control and prevention and economic recovery, which shows China's great capacity for restoration and exuberant vitality,\" he said. China has been criticized for downplaying or even covering up the severity of the virus at the start of the pandemic, and for ignoring evidence that it spread from person-to-person until it was too late. China has repeatedly denied these claims. Hong Kong will enter its third phase of relaxing social distancing measures on Friday, Secretary for Food and Health Sophia Chan said in a news conference today. This phase will see the number of diners allowed to eat together at restaurants increased from two to four, and allows certain entertainment venues to reopen, such as arcades, performance venues, mahjong centers, indoor sports facilities and public entertainment venues. The third phase will also allow up to four people to gather publicly instead of two. Amusement parks -- including popular attractions Disneyland and Ocean Park -- can \"hopefully\" reopen on September 18, Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Edward Yau added. Travel bubble talks: Yau also said Hong Kong is discussing a potential travel bubble with 11 countries. Five or six nations have shown an interest, including Japan and Thailand, he said.  Other countries discussed for the travel bubble are South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, Germany, France, Switzerland, Vietnam, Malaysia and Singapore.  Yau added that travelers within the bubble might be required to take a coronavirus test before departure and upon arrival, and could be limited to visit a few tourist attractions with quotas. ##Reopening## About 15,500 passengers traveled on the Delhi metro in India on Monday, the first day that subway trains came back into service after a five-month closure due to the pandemic.  That's a little over one-hundredth of the 1.5 million people who traveled on these trains daily prior to lockdown measures, according to the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC).  Trains had reduced operating times -- running for four hours in the morning and four hours in the evening -- and reducing the carrying capacity to just 20% compared to usual.  The metro resumed services of one of its busiest lines on Monday and its nine other routes will resume operations in a graded manner by September 12. DMRC has also advised passengers to avoid non-essential travel to avoid over crowding.  All public transport, including suburban trains, was suspended when India announced a nationwide lockdown on March 24, amid a growing coronavirus epidemic. Rising cases: The trains resumed operations as infections surged to a fresh daily high of 90,802 new cases Monday that saw India surpass Brazil as the country with the second-highest number of total cases, after the United States. On Tuesday, India recorded 75,809 new coronavirus cases and 1,133 deaths, according to the Indian Ministry of Health.  That brings the nationwide total to 4,280,422 cases, including 72,775 deaths, the ministry said.  ##Hotspots## The United States recorded 24,362 new cases of the novel coronavirus on Monday, bringing the nationwide total to at least 6,300,727 infections, according to Johns Hopkins University. The death toll rose to at least 189,206 after 265 new virus-related fatalities were also recorded Monday. The totals include cases from all 50 states, the District of Columbia and other US territories, as well as repatriated cases.   CNN is tracking US coronavirus cases here: ##Hotspots## A team of experts on food contamination says it is highly unlikely that food is a source of Covid-19 transmission. The International Commission on Microbiological Specifications for Foods (ICMSF) looked at the evidence that coronavirus might be carried on food or its packaging and found very little. Their finding mirrors earlier reporting from the US Food and Drug Administration that there is no real risk of getting the virus that causes Covid-19 from food or food packaging. \"To date, there has not been any evidence that food, food packaging or food handling is a source or important transmission route for SARS-CoV-2 resulting in Covid-19,\" the organization said in a statement.\n\"There are no foods that should be considered a risk or warrant consideration as a vector for SARS-CoV-2.\" While it is possible that people could eat something contaminated with the virus and become infected that way, it's never been seen to have happened, they said. However, it is still prudent to emphasize good food hygiene practices, the group said. Read the full story: Another federal official is making it clear that despite US President Donald Trump's predictions, there's hardly any chance a vaccine will be available to Americans by Election Day. \"I don't know any scientist involved in this effort who thinks we will be getting shots into arms any time before Election Day,\" said the official, who is familiar with Operation Warp Speed, the federal government's effort to develop coronavirus vaccines. Trump, however, has projected optimism for a quicker timeline. \"(It's) going to be done in a very short period of time -- could even have it during the month of October,\" the President said at a press briefing Monday. \"We'll have the vaccine soon, maybe before a special date. You know what date I'm talking about.\" On August 6, Trump said he was \"optimistic\" a vaccine would be ready by around November 3. \"I believe we'll have the vaccine before the end of the year, certainly, but around that date, yes. I think so,\" Trump said. And at a rally last week, he said, \"It will be delivered before the end of the year, in my opinion, before the end of the year, but it really might even be delivered before the end of October.\" The federal official is not the first to cast skepticism on Trump's forecast. It's \"extremely unlikely, but not impossible\" that a Covid-19 vaccine could be authorized for emergency use by the US Food and Drug Administration before the end of October, Moncef Slaoui, the chief adviser to Operation Warp Speed, told NPR last week. Dr. Larry Corey, who's leading a group set up by the National Institutes of Health to work on coronavirus vaccines, also said he doesn't think there will be a vaccine available by Election Day. \"I would agree with Dr. Slaoui. The chances are very low, very remote,\" said Corey, who leads the COVID-19 Prevention Network. Read why the US likely won't have a vaccine by Election Day: ##Vaccines## Mexico’s Health Ministry identified 3,486 new Covid-19 infections on Monday, bringing the country’s total number of cases to 637,509. The Health Ministry also recorded 223 new virus-related fatalities, raising Mexico’s death toll to 67,781. Mexico has the world’s fourth-highest count of coronavirus deaths, trailing the United States, Brazil and India respectively, according to Johns Hopkins University. Excess deaths: Over the weekend, Mexico’s Health Ministry said it had recorded 122,765 excess deaths in the country during the pandemic. Mexico’s government has said for months that its death toll from Covid-19 is higher than official figures due to low testing in the country. But that lack of testing makes it impossible to know exactly how many of the total amount of excess deaths were due to the virus. ##Hotspots## New graphics from the World Health Organization illustrate how much worse the coronavirus pandemic is in the Americas compared to other regions of the world. The US has more cases and more deaths than any other country, with Brazil coming in a close second.  “The United States of America and Brazil account for nearly three quarters of all COVID-19 cases in the Americas,” WHO said. Yet US President Donald Trump continues to claim that the US case count and death counts are improving, and compare favorably to Europe’s. How these regions compare: While the WHO Americas region and European regions have similar populations -- around 1 billion for the Americas compared to 900 million for Europe -- WHO’s statistics show the Americas account for 46% of all new coronavirus cases over the past seven days, and 59% of newly reported deaths.  Cumulatively, the Americas accounts for 55% of all coronavirus deaths globally, with roughly one-seventh of the total global population. Europe, in contrast, accounts for 13% of all reported new cases over the past seven days, 8% of deaths and 25% of the global total cumulative deaths. WHO says the Americas reported nearly 3.5 times as many new cases as reported by Europe in the past seven days. New cases in the Americas now account for 52% of cumulative cases worldwide. ##Hotspots## In his Monday afternoon news conference, US President Donald Trump got into an exchange with Reuters correspondent Jeff Mason after Mason would not remove his face mask at the request of the President. The President stopped Mason as he began to ask the first question, saying \"you're going to have to take that off, please.\" He gestured to the space between the reporter and the podium, inquiring, \"you're...how many feet are you away?\" Mason replied that he would just speak louder to counter the effects of the mask.  Trump was not satisfied with this response, telling the reporter his voice was \"very muffled\" with the face covering, \"so if you would take it off, it would be a lot easier.\" Mason raised his voice and repeated his offer to speak louder, asking \"is that better?\" The President sighed saying, \"it's better. Yeah, it's better.\" Later in the news conference, Trump remarked that one reporter who did remove his mask sounded \"so clear. As opposed to everybody else, where they refuse.\" This is not the first time that the President has requested a reporter take off his or her mask so that he could hear a question more clearly, but his disappointment with Mason's response was notable. Watch: ##Politics## US President Donald Trump said there could be a coronavirus vaccine \"before a very special date.\" While Trump did not mention which date, he has previously suggested that a vaccine for coronavirus could be ready before Election Day. \"President Trump is getting this vaccine in record time. By the way, if this were the Obama administration, you wouldn't have that vaccine for three years, and you probably wouldn't have it at all,\" Trump said today at a news conference. \"So, we're going to have a vaccine very soon. Maybe even before a very special date. You know what date I'm talking about,\" he added. Facts First: It's possible that a vaccine could be approved by the Food and Drug Administration at some point in November, but there is obviously no firm timeline or guarantee that one will be. And even when one is approved, it will likely still be many months before it's widely available across the US.

Many gathered in large groups on Saturday. In San Francisco, city officials announced on Sunday morning they would be closing the parking lot at Ocean Beach after a gathering celebrating Burning Man culture attracted a big crowd. More than 1,000 people flocked to the event at the beach, according to San Francisco Mayor London Breed, who called the gathering \"reckless and selfish.\" Throngs of people were expected at Tybee Island beaches in Georgia over the weekend, CNN affiliate WTOC reported. And images from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, showed umbrellas lined up side-by-side down the beach. In Atlanta, many weekend Labor Day parties were on the schedule, including \"The Biggest Labor Day Weekend Party in the City\" hosted by rapper Gucci Mane and a \"Sunday Funday\" rooftop party advertised with an image of people standing close together, some without masks. In the days leading up to the holiday weekend, experts including Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, urged people should continue to keep distance, wear masks and avoid groups as they enjoy the weekend.", "Section": "world", "Writers": ["Helen Regan", "Adam Renton", "Mike Hayes", "Meg Wagner", "Veronica Rocha"], "URL": "https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/coronavirus-pandemic-09-08-20-intl/index.html", "MainKeyWord": "Hong Kong", "AdditionalKeyWord": "Thailand", "Source": "CNN"}
