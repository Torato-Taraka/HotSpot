{"Type": "article", "Time": "2020-04-24", "Headline": "April 24 coronavirus news", "Text": "Our live coverage of the global coronavirus pandemic has moved here. In Italy, at least 150 doctors have died after contracting coronavirus, the Italian Association of Doctors said on Friday. Health care professionals account for about 10% of all infections, the organization said. A separate Italian health care group, ANAAO, criticized the decree aimed at strengthening the health system, saying it's not good enough. ANAAO called the measures set out in the Cura Italia decree — which is worth 25 billion euros ($27 billion) and was approved by the government on Friday — \"completely disappointing.\" \"The additional funding provided is not enough to guarantee the remuneration of all the overtime fielded between February and March with generosity and a spirit of sacrifice by the health workers to face the tsunami of patients who poured into hospitals, hitting the health care system that has been under financed for decades,\" a statement from the organization said. ##Health## Air France-KLM Group and Air France have secured $7.5 billion in financing to help it remain solvent during the Covid-19 crisis, the airline group announced in a statement. The financing comes in two parts: a French state-backed loan of roughly $4.3 billion (4 billion euros) granted by a syndicate of six banks (guaranteed by the French state up to 90%) and a direct shareholder's loan of roughly $3.2 billion (3 billion euros) from the French state to the airline group. “This aid mechanism, which remains subject to approval by the European Commission, will enable the Air France-KLM Group to provide Air France with the means necessary to meet its obligations by continuing its transformation in order to adapt in a sector that the global crisis will severely disrupt,” the statement said.  \"This is not a blank check. There are conditions of profitability,\" French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said in an interview on French network TF1. \"Air France must become the most environmentally-friendly company on the planet.\" The statement also said negotiations with the Dutch government over support to KLM are ongoing. According to data from February 2019, the French state holds a 14.3% stake in Air France-KLM and the Dutch government has 14%. Delta owns 8.8% of the company.   The UK will host a \"Global Vaccines Summit\" on June 4 in an effort to encourage the international community to “come together” to support the development of a Covid-19 vaccine, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab announced Friday.   “Diseases have no borders, so we must come together to make sure that Gavi [The Vaccine Alliance] is fully funded and its expertise is at the heart of efforts to secure broad access to any COVID-19 vaccine,” Raab tweeted.  Gavi is an international organization that aims to bring together the public and private sectors to improve access to vaccines. In a later tweet, the British foreign secretary added that the UK will also co-host the Coronavirus Global Response Summit on May 4 alongside its international partners, including the European Union, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Norway and South Africa.  “The UK is playing a leading role in efforts to develop a COVID vaccine and better testing. We’re pleased to co-host the Coronavirus Global Response Summit on 4 May with our partners…to develop a vaccine together,” he added.  London's Metropolitan Police arrested more than 4,000 people for domestic abuse since the restrictions imposed to stop the spread of coronavirus were introduced, the force said in a statement on Friday. \"The COVID-19 restrictions and 'stay at home' instruction is vital to managing this public health crisis, but unfortunately it has also left current and potential victims of domestic abuse even more vulnerable and isolated,\" said Commander Sue Williams, the Met's lead for safeguarding. She added: \"Victims should be assured that they can leave their homes to escape harm or seek help, and they will not be penalized in any way for not maintaining social distancing, or otherwise breaching COVID-19 restrictions. Our prime concern is protecting victims and others who are affected, and bringing offenders to justice.\" The UK government has green-lit trials for drone delivery of medicines and medical equipment, UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said at the daily coronavirus briefing on Friday. Plans were already in motion to use drones to make deliveries in the UK, but due to the coronavirus crisis, \"now we have an urgent need\" to fast-track them, he said. The trials will begin next week and will carry medical equipment to St Mary's Hospital on the Isle of Wight, off UK's southern coast, Shapps said. Leaders from around the world joined the World Health Organization, after it announced the launch of a new effort to accelerate the development of vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Here's what they're saying:  Melinda Gates, speaking for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, a co-host of the effort, said, “the moment we are living through right now is a reminder, that we’re all part of the same global community. As new diagnostics, treatments and vaccines become available, we have a responsibility to get them out equitably, with the understanding that all lives have equal value.” \nAntónio Guterres, secretary-general of the United Nations said “the world needs development, production and equitable delivery of safe and effective Covid-19 vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics.” \nGiuseppe Conte, prime minister of Italy said, “There is one thing we understand well, finding and distributing the vaccine is the only way to win this battle,” adding, \"You can count on Italy, together we will make it.”\nDominic Raab, Britain’s Foreign secretary who has stepped in for Boris Johnson, said “by working together, we can develop an affordable vaccine which is accessible to everyone who needs it, as quickly as possible, to end this pandemic once and for all.” \nCyril Ramaphosa, president of South Africa said, “As now more than ever, the world needs solidarity and cooperation to mobilize and guide all efforts and drive delivery towards equitable access to new Covid-19 diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines.” Ramaphosa added, “Africa is extremely vulnerable to the ravages of this virus, and is in need of every possible support and assistance.” \nErna Solberg, Norway prime minister said, “We must commit to a system of fair global access, because as long as the virus is active somewhere, we are at risk everywhere.” \nMuhyiddin Yassin, prime minister of Malaysia said, “the only way we can destroy this common invisible enemy of ours is through solidarity and cooperation. The world needs to come together to coordinate our efforts and expedite the development of effective tools to stop the spread of this disease.” ##Health## The United States will send ventilators to Ecuador, El Salvador and Indonesia, President Trump tweeted Friday, announcing he spoke with the countries' presidents. \"Just spoke to my friend, President Joko Widodo of the Republic of Indonesia. Asking for Ventilators, which we will provide,\" the President wrote. \"Great cooperation between us!\" Trump said he had a \"great conversation with President Lenin Moreno\" of Ecuador. He added that the US \"will be sending them desperately needed Ventilators, of which we have recently manufactured many, and helping them in other ways. They are fighting hard against CoronaVirus!\" Trump also praised El Salvador for helping the US on immigration.  \"Will be helping them with Ventilators, which are desperately needed,\" Trump wrote. \"They have worked well with us on immigration at the Southern Border!\" Bavaria, Germany's largest federal state, will allow church and other religious services to go ahead under certain conditions beginning on May 4, local authorities said on Friday. Visitors must maintain a distance of about 2 meters, or about six feet, from each other and wear face coverings. There will also be a 60-minute time limit,  Bavaria's head of the state chancellery Florian Herrmann told CNN in a statement. He warned that there needs to be an abundance of caution in conducting the services, adding: ''No infections should follow from encounters of faith! Faith and community strengthens us, especially in challenging times.'' Bavaria is the German state with the highest number of confirmed coronavirus cases and deaths.  ##Daily Life## The European Union plans to raise 7.5 billion Euro — or about $8.1 billion USD — from a global pledging effort to respond to the coronavirus pandemic.  President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen said the campaign will begin on May 4.  She said the money will be used to ramp up efforts to prevent the virus from spreading, as well as treatment options for those who fall ill. “This is a first step only, but more will be needed in the future,” she said. “The European Union will spare no effort to help the world come together against coronavirus.” ##Health## ##Business## France says it will not make a decision on when to lift Covid-19 restrictions on restaurants and cafés until the end of May. “Nothing would be worse than a hasted reopening that would entail new closure later. We prefer to take the time to plan a reopening in the best sanitary conditions possible,\" French finance minister Bruno Le Maire said. Le Maire added “solidarity” must be shown by landlords toward restaurant owners who are unable to pay their rent, otherwise restaurants will have to declare bankruptcy and they “won’t be any money anyway” he added.  ##Daily Life## Undeterred by a barrage of criticism, the US state of Georgia is moving ahead with its plan to help restart its economy, reopening some nonessential businesses today. Gov. Brian Kemp is one of America's first governors to ease restrictions, allowing gyms, barber shops, hair salons, tattoo parlors, massage therapists and bowling alleys to resume work, so long as they comply with social distancing guidelines. But maintaining a safe distance in many of those businesses is next to impossible, leaving owners feeling conflicted, Faith Karimi writes. \"Get your hair done for what? There's a pandemic, people are dying,\" one hair stylist said.   The House of Representatives approved a $480 billion package yesterday to help refresh a dwindling small-businesses loan program, as another 4.4 million people filed for unemployment. The coronavirus has put a staggering 26 million Americans out of work since mid-March.   But the aid did not include money for state governments to help keep workers on their payrolls — assistance that a bipartisan group of governors and mayors have been begging for from Washington. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell drew the ire of governors for suggesting that \"blue states\" hit hard by the outbreak seek bankruptcy protections rather than be given a federal bailout. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said the remark from the Kentucky Republican was reckless and that the pandemic was no time for divisive politics: \"It’s not red and blue. It’s red, white and blue.\"   Here's what else you need to know today. Can sunlight and bleach cure the coronavirus? The short answer is: No. US health experts are rushing to warn against President Donald Trump’s suggestion that zapping patients with UV light or even injecting disinfectant into the lungs could help treat the virus. The claims, touted by Trump during yesterday’s press briefing, have been slammed for endangering public health. Too much UV light damage can lead to skin cancer. And chlorine bleach is toxic: it can and does kill people who drink it.   A silent, deadly spread: US health officials said months ago that the risk to the public was low. But new research and two February deaths confirmed as virus-related, prove that Covid-19 was already spreading much earlier than previously thought. Drug hopes fade: Global stocks slumped today after a study into a potential coronavirus treatment was halted following inconclusive results. Drug maker Gilead said it had terminated a trial of Remdesivir early, and thus had no conclusive findings about its effectiveness.  24 hours in a UK intensive care unit: CNN spent a day inside a hospital in the Midlands, the worst-hit area of Britain outside of London. Nurses and doctors there offered these two warnings: 1. They fear a second wave as soon as lockdowns lift. 2. Just because the country’s capital city is seeing the virus ebb, doesn’t mean it isn’t ravaging other regions. India's Muslims attacked, blamed for spread: Hafiz Mohammed Naseerudin, a 44-year-old Imam, says that after a police officer assaulted him for being a Muslim and blamed him for spreading the coronavirus, he was left lying on the road for almost an hour. He’s not alone. As fears of a widespread outbreak mount in India, some of the country's Muslims, who make up roughly 200 million of the country's 1.3 billion population, have been targeted in Islamophobic attacks on the streets and online, and accused of spreading the virus.  Travel bans amid Ramadan: Indonesia has temporarily banned domestic road, air and sea travel, as the world's most populous Muslim nation marks the start of the holy month of Ramadan. Tens of millions of people normally make their way home to celebrate the end of Ramadan each year, an annual tradition called mudik. But, as the country grapples with rapidly rising numbers of infections, there are concerns mass migration could spark further outbreaks. A version of this story first appeared in CNN's Coronavirus: Fact Vs. Fiction newsletter. You can sign up here. EU leaders have agreed to create a fund that could raise at least 1 trillion euros ($1.1 trillion) to rebuild regional economies ravaged by the coronavirus pandemic. \"This fund shall be of a sufficient magnitude, targeted towards the sectors and geographical parts of Europe most affected, and be dedicated to dealing with this unprecedented crisis,\" leaders of the 27 EU countries said in a statement after they met via video conference on Thursday. The heads of the EU governments asked officials at the European Commission to come up with detailed proposals \"urgently\" that will include how the recovery fund will relate to the bloc's budget for 2021-2027, they added. The EU is planning to expand its budget from about 1.2% of GDP to 2% of GDP and then use those additional funds as a guarantee to borrow at low rates from financial markets. Asked by reporters how much could be raised, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said: \"This has to be looked at thoroughly ... but we are not talking about billion[s], we are talking about trillion[s].\" The EU leaders also signed off on an immediate package of rescue measures worth at least €500 billion ($538 billion) drawn up earlier this month by finance ministers. That package includes up to €100 billion ($110 billion) in wage subsidies aimed at preventing mass layoffs, as well as hundreds of billions in loans to businesses and credit for EU governments. \"There are reasons for some optimism that, even if we don't get as joined-up a response as we'd like overall, the European fiscal response to this crisis may yet end up being sizeable,\" commented Societe Generale strategist Kit Juckes in a research note on Friday.

The maker of Lysol issued a statement Friday clarifying that under no circumstances should its products be administered into the human body, after US President Donald Trump suggested the possibility of injecting disinfectants to treat the coronavirus. Manufacturer Reckitt Benckiser said that the range of disinfectants and cleaners must not enter the body \"through injection, ingestion or any other route.”   “We have a responsibility in providing consumers with access to accurate, up-to-date information as advised by leading public health experts,” the company said. The statement followed remarks from President Trump on Thursday on the use of disinfectants. \"And then I see the disinfectant where it knocks it out in one minute. Is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning ... it would be interesting to check that,\" Trump said.  “It sounds interesting to me,” he added. CNN’s Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta was quick to point out that this is simply wrong. “He also said it needs to be studied. Actually, it doesn’t. I mean we know the answer to this one,” he said on CNN’s Anderson Cooper 360 on Thursday.  “I think everybody would know that that would be dangerous and counter-productive.” The US Food and Drug Administration regularly warns the public against drinking bleach, or even inhaling fumes from bleach. It's also irritating to skin. On Monday, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said calls about poisonings with cleaners and disinfectants had increased more than 20% in the first three months of 2020 -- as coronavirus cleaning increased -- than from the same period a year earlier. Among cleaners, bleaches accounted for the largest percentage increase in calls from 2019 to 2020. The CDC recommends using soap and water or bleach on surfaces to kill the virus. Rubbing alcohol that's at least 70% alcohol will also kill it on surfaces; 60% for your hands. The UN’s human rights chief says she is “alarmed” by the treatment of the independent media by several nations over the reporting of Covid-19.  Michelle Bachelet said on Friday that “restrictive measures” imposed on media as well as the “arrest and intimidation” of journalists, is hindering the free flow information, “vital in fighting Covid-19.” “Some states have used the outbreak of the new coronavirus as a pretext to restrict information and stifle criticism,” Bachelet said. “A free media is always essential, but we have never depended on it more than we do during this pandemic, when so many people are isolated and fearing for their health and livelihoods. Credible, accurate reporting is a lifeline for all of us,” the statement says. Bachelet cites reports of violations against journalists in Asia-Pacific, Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. She said there are cases of journalists being threatened and even disappearing for voicing criticism of state response to the pandemic or for “simply questioning the accuracy of official numbers.” Concerns over treatment of the press: Earlier this week a leading media watchdog told CNN that the coronavirus pandemic could have been avoided had there been a free press in China. \"Reporting the truth at the earliest possible moment would have allowed the rest of the world to react probably earlier and probably more seriously,\" Reporters Without Borders' Rebecca Vincent said. \"The consequences (of stifling media freedom) are actually deadly.\" The UK government’s new website designed to allow essential workers to directly book a coronavirus test has already been closed to new applications just hours after being launched. The site went live at 6am UK time (1aET). By late Friday morning, users trying to book a test were greeted by a message saying: “You can’t currently register for a Covid-19 test. Please check back here later.” The Department of Health and Social Care said on Twitter: “There has been significant demand for booking tests today. We apologise for any inconvenience. We are continuing to rapidly increase availability. More tests will be available tomorrow.” Boris Johnson's government has been criticized for failing to provide the same level of testing that other European countries have, with several NHS hospitals, health care workers and care home employees complaining about being unable to access tests. The government launched the site to try to increase the number of people being tested for the virus. Those classified as \"essential workers\" with coronavirus symptoms are eligible to be tested. People who live with essential workers and have symptoms are also eligible for a test. Britain's Health Secretary Matt Hancock set a target of conducting 100,000 tests per day by the end of April -- but on Wednesday, just 23,560 tests were carried out. Researchers in China say they have successfully cloned antibodies from recovered coronavirus patients, a potential first step in developing a new type of treatment for the virus.  In test tubes, the antibodies prevented the binding of the novel coronavirus to its receptor, according to the researchers. Antibodies that block that step – which is critical for infection – could one day be a promising treatment for the virus.  But it’s not clear whether blocking the binding of the virus in a lab means the antibodies could prevent infection in real humans.  The researchers published their findings Monday in the medical journal Cellular and Molecular Immunology. They cloned two different antibodies – called 311mab-31B5 and 311mab-32D4 – and said the antibodies “neutralized” the entry of a fake coronavirus into cells.  The antibodies could one day be used as “prophylactic and therapeutic agents,” the researchers said, suggesting they could one day be used to both prevent and treat Covid-19. Using cloned antibodies to treat diseases is not a new concept. The approach has been used to develop experimental treatments for Ebola, using antibodies from animals or people exposed to the virus.  The underlying idea – that antibodies can be used as a treatment – is also being tested in trials of so-called convalescent plasma. That treatment is somewhat different, though, with people who have recovered from the novel coronavirus giving their antibody-filled blood plasma to those who are sick.  It remains unclear whether cloned antibodies – such as those developed by the Chinese researchers – could be a successful treatment for the novel coronavirus, and this new research is in its earliest stages.  The approach may hold promise, though. In 2018, the top US infectious disease specialist, Anthony Fauci, wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine that “effective antibodies have become easier to identify, select, optimize, and manufacture.” Writing alongside other experts, Fauci said the treatments, technically called monoclonal antibodies, “are positioned to play a larger role in future public health responses involving the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of [emerging infectious diseases].”  But the antibodies come with a downside: they’re incredibly expensive. As Fauci wrote, “pragmatic concerns must be addressed – notably cost.”  It was just three months ago that Mr Wang was paying the workers at his Wuhan restaurant their Chinese New Year bonuses and celebrating his third year in business. Now, after 76 days under lockdown in the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, he has been left mentally and financially drained, with his business facing ruin. The lockdown on Wuhan was lifted on April 8. But two weeks later Wang's restaurant is still not allowed to fully reopen, due to restrictions on eat-in dining. Despite having no business, he's still had to pay three months rent -- worth almost $8,500 (60,000 yuan). With fears rising of a second wave of infections which could cause even more financial pain across China, Wang said he has no choice but to close shop. \"In Wuhan, there are many people like us who can no longer go back to what they were doing before the outbreak,\" he said. Wang asked us to only use his first name over concerns about the consequences of talking to foreign media. Wang is just one of Wuhan's many business owners struggling to get back on their feet in a difficult local economy. In the first quarter of the year alone, the economy of Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital, shrank by almost 40%, according to state-run news agency Xinhua. That's in addition to the mental toll from a strict and lengthy lockdown, the fear of the viral outbreak itself and grief at the loss of loved ones and friends. Wang said three relatives had caught the novel coronavirus, one of whom passed away from the disease. The family was unable to have a funeral for him. \"During that period, we were actually really terrified, really terrified,\" he said. Read more from Wuhan, China here. Germany’s coronavirus reproduction rate has increased to 0.9 according to the country's centre for disease and control, the Robert Koch Institute, meaning every 10 people with the virus infect an average of nine others. That’s up from a reproduction rate of 0.7 a week ago, according to the Institute’s Vice President Lars Schaade. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has previously warned that if the number -- also known as the R0 value -- rises above 1, the country’s health system would eventually be overwhelmed. Yesterday she expressed concern that some German states were moving to ease coronavirus restrictions too soon, saying it could undermine the results that have been achieved. New cases slowing down: Germany now has 150,383 coronavirus cases and 5,321 related deaths, the Robert Koch Institute said on Friday.  The country reported 2,337 new cases in the past 24 hours -- a slight slowdown, after three straight days of new infections accelerating.  ##Health## Three southern Sydney beaches closed for a second time, only five days after being reopened, according to a statement from the Randwick City Council. The beaches of Clovelly, Coogee and Maroubra were shut at 1pm Friday after “people failed to use beaches for exercise only.” The three beaches will reopen Saturday and Sunday between 6am to 9am for exercise only, according to the council. The situation will be reassessed on Monday. On Wednesday, Waverly Council, home to Bondi beach, announced Bondi and Bronte beaches would reopen starting next Tuesday (April 28) for swimming and surfing.  All land-based activities on the beach, such as jogging, sunbathing, and social gatherings, will continue to be suspended. In March, Bondi beach closed down after thousands of beachgoers ignored the advice from officials to avoid large gatherings and practice social distancing.  Singapore recorded 897 new coronavirus cases as of 12 p.m. local time on Friday amid a second wave of infections centered around migrant worker dormitories. Among the new cases, the vast majority are work permit holders residing in foreign worker dormitories, while 13 are Singaporean citizens or permanent residents, the country's Ministry of Health said in a statement.  The country's cases spiked dramatically at the start of April, and authorities traced the increase to clusters of cases in the dormitories. About 200,000 migrant workers live in 43 dormitories, where cramped conditions and shared facilities make it easy for a highly infectious virus to spread. Singapore passed the threshold of 10,000 cases earlier this week. Friday marks the first time the country has reported fewer than 1,000 daily new infections since April 19. The dormitories are now all under lockdown, with nobody in or out. Authorities have taken residents showing symptoms to quarantine, and are monitoring residents still inside the dorms. ##Health##  Global stocks slumped on Friday after a study into a potential coronavirus treatment was halted following inconclusive results. South Korea's Kospi Index fell 1.4% in afternoon trade, while Japan's Nikkei 225 slid 0.9%. China's Shanghai Composite was down about 1%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index dipped 0.4%. Dow futures were slightly lower, after the index closed in the green Thursday. S&P 500 futures dropped 0.3% and Nasdaq futures were down about 0.5%. Asia's major indexes were already struggling this week as countries released dismal economic data and as an historic oil price crash roiled markets. Now, they're poised to close out their first week in negative territory since early April after drug maker Gilead said it terminated a trial of Remdesivir early, and thus had no conclusive findings about its effectiveness in treating Covid-19. Shares in the company closed down 4.3% on Wall Street on Thursday. Read more here. ##Business## The coronavirus pandemic continues to see case number rise by the thousands every day, as countries work to halt the spread of the virus. But in some nations, including the United States and Czech Republic, plans are in place to ease restrictions aimed at curbing the spread of the virus, despite health experts' warnings. Here's what's happened since our last catch-up: Ramadan starts under lockdown: It's the first day of the holy month of Ramadan for Muslims. In Indonesia, millions can't travel home as is custom due to travel bans, and in Malaysia, the national lockdown has been extended through early May.\nMuslims attacked in India: Muslims in the country are facing discrimination, attacks, and being blamed for spreading the virus. An infection cluster was identified at a Muslim group's event last month, heightening public fear and Islamophobia.\nNo return date for Boris Johnson: The British prime minister is recovering at his countryside retreat, but there's no decision yet on when he will return to work, Health Secretary Matt Hancock told Sky News.\nUS nears 50,000 deaths: The death toll in the country stands at 49,963, according to Johns Hopkins University, as total confirmed cases approached 870,000.\nJapan gender controversy: The mayor of Osaka came under fire after saying men would make more effective grocery shoppers than women, as officials struggle to prevent overcrowding at stores.\nAnd for some good news: New Kids On The Block are back with some new music. They released a coronavirus song \"House Party\" to lift spirits and raise funds for charity. UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock says he understands the economic pressure to remove coronavirus restrictions, but he won’t allow changes until it's safe to do so. Some countries have begun to ease restrictions or set out time frames for when some measures will be relaxed. \"I understand the economic pressures,\" Hancock told BBC radio. \"(But) I will not allow for changes to be made that are unsafe. We've got to keep the public safe.\"\n\"The worst thing for the economy would be a second spike. And instead, if you get the number of new cases right down then you can hold it down through testing, tracking and tracing. And that allows you to release more of the measures.\n\"So I understand those voices who are saying that we should move sooner, but that is not something we are going to do.\" The Scottish government has published its framework for deciding when to ease restrictions, saying it would be prepared to move ahead of the rest of the UK if it made sense to do so. ##Daily Life## ##Business## Malaysia has extended its nationwide lockdown order for an additional two weeks, now lasting through May 12, according to state news agency Bernama. The restrictions were set to end on April 28. The lockdown was first announced on March 18. Essential services were exempt, like health care, transportation and the food industry. Malaysia has recorded 5,603 coronavirus cases, including 95 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. Malaysian Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin announced the extension yesterday evening, on the eve of the holy month of Ramadan for Muslims, in a national address on television. \"If this downward trend in (active) cases continues, the government may give some relaxation,\" Bernama quoted the Prime Minister as saying. On the other hand, if the lockdown is extended further, it could prevent people from celebrating Eid al-Fitr when Ramadan ends toward the end of May, he warned. Muhyiddin called the lockdown a sacrifice by the people, saying national efforts had paid off in reducing the number of new cases reported daily, according to Bernama. ##Daily Life## So many people in Sweden have been exposed to the coronavirus that the country will likely be in a better place to withstand a second wave of infections, said state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell. Sweden has taken a relatively relaxed approach to coronavirus-related restrictions when compared with other European countries. \"It has worked in some aspects,\" Tegnell told BBC radio. \"It has worked because our health system has been able to cope. There has always been at least 20% of the intensive care beds empty and able to take care of Covid-19 patients.\" Tegnell estimated an immunity level of between 15% to 20% had been reached in the  Stockholm population, which he said would \"slow down the spread (of a second wave).\" But he cautioned that it wouldn't be enough to achieve herd immunity, and that there's still a lot unknown about immunity to the disease. Sweden has reported 16,755 cases of the coronavirus, including 2,021 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Asked whether the death toll would have been lower if Sweden had implemented tighter restrictions, Tegnell replied, \"that’s a very difficult question to answer at this stage. At least 50% of our death toll is within the elderly homes and we have a hard time understanding how a lockdown would stop the introduction of the disease into the elderly homes.\" ##Health## Last week, a mother in India infected with Covid-19 gave birth to a baby girl. The mother had to be kept in isolation, and saw her baby for the first time after delivery via video conferencing. The baby was born in Aurangabad, a city in the western state of Maharashtra. When the family arrived at the hospital, the mother and her two sons tested positive for coronavirus, but her husband tested negative, according to Dr. Sundar Kulkarni, a surgeon at Aurangabad Civil Hospital. The mother had gestational diabetes and hypothyroidism, making the birth a \"challenge,\" said Kulkarni -- but \"when we delivered a healthy baby it was quite a memorable moment for us.\" \"Once the baby was delivered, the mother kept asking for the child because naturally she wanted to see her, then we got the idea to have a video call. The baby recognized her mother's voice and was smiling and laughing as this was the only voice she knew since when she was in the womb,\" Kulkarni said.  Nurses have been using a breast pump to extract the mother's milk and feeding it to the baby. The family can be reunited after the mother tests negative for two consecutive days. ##Health## ##Daily Life## There's no decision yet on when UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson will return to work, said Health Secretary Matt Hancock, speaking to Sky News. \"I spoke to the prime minister yesterday -- he's in good shape. And I’m sure he’ll come back as soon as his doctors recommend it,\" Hancock said. \"The decision hasn’t been taken, but the prime minister is taking calls and staying in touch.\" Johnson has spoken to US President Donald Trump and the Queen by phone this week, while he continues to recover at the prime minister’s countryside retreat, Chequers. ##Health## Indonesian President Joko Widodo addressed Muslims on the first day of the holy month of Ramadan, as millions began their fast. \"There is no splendor on the streets, the mosque space is in silence,\" he said on an official social media page. \"Let's welcome the blessing of Ramadan as a moment to break the chain of transmission of the plague for the sake of personal safety, relatives, and the entire nation.\" Typically, millions of Muslims migrate from the capital Jakarta to their hometowns for Ramadan -- but a travel ban is in place this year to prevent the spread of coronavirus. The government hasn't officially banned gathering at mosques across the country.  But Indonesia's largest Islamic organizations, the Ulema Council and Nahdlatul Ulama, called for Muslims not to pray together in the mosque to avoid close contact and possible infections. More than 87% of Indonesia's 267 million population is Muslim, making the archipelago nation the world's most-populous Muslim-majority country. ##Daily Life## Sunlight and bleach can both kill the novel coronavirus, a federal official told the daily White House briefing on Thursday. But US President Donald Trump turned what should have been a simple scientific summary into a puzzling stream of dangerous ideas about somehow streaming light into the body and suggestions about injecting disinfectants. Here's what was said: Bill Bryan, a senior official at the US Department of Homeland Security, said studies on the virus showed bleach kills coronavirus in about five minutes, and isopropyl alcohol destroys it even faster.  He also said the virus dies quickest under direct sunlight, and that temperature and humidity affect how long the virus survives. This was Trump's take: \"Suppose that we hit the body with a tremendous, whether it's ultraviolet or just very powerful light and I think you said that it hasn't been checked and you're going to test it,\" Trump told Bryan. \"Suppose you can bring the light inside the body.\" It was not immediately clear how Trump would propose bringing light into the body. \"And then I see the disinfectant where it knocks it out in one minute. Is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning ... it would be interesting to check that,\" Trump added. Scientists were horrified by his claims. Multiple experts warned after Trump's briefing that nobody should ingest disinfectant, and that it simply doesn't work. The World Health Organization says on its website that exposing yourself to the sun or high temperatures does not prevent Covid-19, and warns specifically against using ultraviolet lamps, including tanning lamps, to try to kill virus.  \"UV lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation,\" the WHO cautions. Too much UV light damage can lead to skin cancer. And chlorine bleach is toxic: it can and does kill people who drink it. The US Food and Drug Administration regularly warns the public against drinking bleach, or even inhaling fumes from bleach. It's also irritating to skin.

Some 27 million people were expected to migrate from Jakarta, the Indonesian capital, back to .their home villages, according to a survey by the Transportation Ministry. This mass migration, called \"Idul Fitri mudik,\" usually happens ahead of the first day of fasting during the holy month of Ramadan. The travel ban, which will block this migration, includes air, ground, and sea transportation from Jakarta. Exceptions will be made for emergency services like food or medicine supply, and transportation for paramedics, fire department, and ambulances. Roads will not be completely blockaded, but there will be checkpoints in place to encourage drivers or travelers to turn back to where they started. These checkpoints will be in place until May 7; after that, people will be subject to a fine or jail time for violating the travel ban, said Transportation Ministry spokesperson Adita Irawati. ##Travel## ##Daily Life## More than 100 former senior bureaucrats in India have published an open letter protesting against discriminatory attacks against Muslims, which have been on the rise amid growing coronavirus fears in the country. Published under the banner of former civil servants' group Constitutional Conduct, the letter was signed by former ambassadors, high commissioners and chief secretaries to the Indian government and various state governments. The harassment spiked after a Muslim group called Tablighi Jamaat met in New Delhi last month. Thousands of members traveled across India to the meeting, and began to fall sick with Covid-19 after the event -- raising public fears of infection, and heightening Islamophobia. \"The action of the Jamaat in organising such an event, ignoring the Delhi Government’s advisories was, without question, misguided and condemnable. However, the action of the media in communalizing it and extending it to the Muslim community as a whole is utterly irresponsible and reprehensible,\" states the letter. The letter mentions incidents in which Muslims have been allegedly denied treatment at hospitals or discriminated against during food distribution. “The entire country is going through unprecedented trauma. We can endure, survive and overcome the challenges that this pandemic has imposed on us only by remaining united and helping each other,” the letter said.  ##Daily Life## It's the feel good song of your quarantine. New Kids on the Block has achieved quite the feat. The group not only recorded \"House Party,\" a new song out today that is bound to get you dancing in your living room, but they even made a music video all while social distancing. \"We were just talking and fans were asking about new music and I just threw out maybe one of our musical friends is hearing this and will send us a song,\" said band member Donnie Wahlberg. \"Literally, an hour later a song was in my phone via text, a music track, and I sat right there at the table and just started writing 'House Party.'\" To pull it off while scattered across the country, the group had to each get microphones shipped to their homes. Band member Jordan Knight says he had a producer listening to him on FaceTime while he sang to give feedback. The song also features Boyz II Men, Jordan Sparks, Naughty By Nature and Big Freedia. The best part -- it's for a good cause. All proceeds of the song go to the No Kid Hungry campaign to end childhood hunger in America. ##Daily Life## Roll up for Donald Trump's old West traveling medicine show. He's marketed steaks and real estate, board games and vodka, but nothing the incorrigible salesman has tried to hawk measures up to his latest routine as he speculated on a possible new cure for Covid-19. For most of his life as a pitchman, Trump has only had his own reputation on the line. But now, in the middle of a generational health crisis, lives are at stake. In an eye-popping moment, Trump doubled down on his claim that sunlight and the festering humidity of high summer could purge the virus in his latest grab for a game-changer therapy. Then, he asked aides on camera whether zapping patients with light or injecting disinfectant into the lungs to clean sick patients from inside could cure them of the disease. \"Maybe you can, maybe you can't. Again I say maybe you can, maybe you can't. I'm not a doctor. I'm like a person who has a good you-know-what,\" Trump said, pointing to his head. It's easy to mock Trump. But he also has the world's largest megaphone, appears to be openly mulling a treatment that could cause people to poison themselves if they adopted it and has a record of deflecting from the grave reality of the virus to peddle optimism that may not be matched by the facts. He also seems to have little time for the rigorous clinical testing and factual deduction that is at the heart of generations of advances in clinical science and is the bedrock of ethical medicine. Read the full analysis: ##Health## CNN held a global town hall earlier on the facts and fears surrounding the coronavirus pandemic. The lineup included international correspondents, medical experts, political leaders and special guest Alicia Keys. Here are some of the highlights: There's no proven treatment yet: While hundreds of trials are being planned, approved, and already underway to find a drug that can fight the virus, researchers have yet to find a drug that definitively works, said representatives from the World Health Organization and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\nThe virus arrived in the US early: Dr. Sara Cody, the public health director of California's Santa Clara County, acknowledged that the coronavirus was likely circulating in the country a lot longer than experts first thought.\nIt can't be transmitted through food: There's no evidence eating is a risk, and the American food supply is safe, said FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn.\nIt's a respiratory illness: This means you can't get sick from \"eating\" the virus; the reason it's risky to touch your eyes, nose, or mouth is because you might inhale the virus or get infected after touching the mucus membranes in those areas.\nDon't drink disinfectant: Regardless of what US President Donald Trump suggests, doctors are in agreement: ingesting bleach or other types of disinfectant is extremely dangerous and won't kill the virus.\nThis is a food crisis: With 26.5 million Americans unemployed, the US is facing a humanitarian food crisis that Congress and the White House need to address, said celebrity chef Jose Andres, whose program provides free meals to the needy.\nPowerful anthem: Alicia Keys debuted her new single  \"Good Job\" during the town hall, which celebrates the everyday heroes of the pandemic. \"There are heroes among us right now, you know, and this song really celebrates the fact that you're doing an amazing job,\" the 15-time Grammy winner said. You can watch the entire town hall here: Close to 50,000 people have now died of coronavirus in the United States. Even if we assume we're at the top of the curve, tens of thousands more will die.  By this time next week, it seems very possible that more people will have died in the US of Covid-19 than the 58,000 who died in nearly of decade of fighting in Vietnam.  We're already far past the more than 35,000 who died in the Korean War. The country was much smaller during those conflicts -- but it seemed everyone had a story.  The same will be true now. Even if you don't know someone who has died of this disease, you can be sure the death toll includes relatives of people you've heard of. Sen. Elizabeth Warren's brother died and Rep. Maxine Waters' sister is dying, we learned Thursday.  And there's more new data suggesting many more people have been infected than previously thought. Northeastern University researchers suggest that by March 1, when the first coronavirus case was confirmed in New York, more than 10,000 were already infected in the city. The country continues to try to figure out how to process tragic human loss on a wartime scale with the continued and unfathomable economic loss necessary to make sure fewer people die. ##Health## The mayor of Japan's third largest city is facing a public backlash after he said men would make more effective grocery shoppers than women as officials struggle to prevent overcrowding at stores amid the coronavirus pandemic. The number of confirmed cases of the virus has spiked in recent weeks -- dashing hopes that the government's initial virus response had succeeded in controlling its spread. As of Friday, Japan had recorded 13,100 confirmed cases, including 330 deaths, according to the country's health ministry. On March 1, Japan had reported just 243 cases. That spike has seen a raft of new restrictions put in place nationwide. On Thursday, Osaka Mayor Ichiro Matsui implied male grocery shoppers would reduce the potential spread of the virus as they would spend less time in shops.  \"Women take a longer time grocery shopping because they browse through different products and weigh out which option is best,\" Matsui told reporters at a coronavirus news conference in Osaka on Thursday. \n\"Men quickly grab what they're told to buy so they won't linger at the supermarket -- that avoids close contact with others.\" Gender inequality: Women account for more than 51% of the Japanese population, according to World Bank data. However, Japan is ranked 110th out of 149 countries in the World Economic Forum's gender gap index. Journalist fires back: The mayor's comments prompted journalist Shoko Egawa to post on Twitter that \"people who know nothing about daily life shouldn't make comments.\" Egawa's post gleaned over 3,000 retweets, with one social media user suggesting in a  tweet that Matsui had probably never done the shopping himself. Another commentator tweeted that Japan's tragedy was having politicians like Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso, who they said knew nothing about daily life. Limiting crowds at supermarkets: Osaka has been under a state of emergency since April 7. Matsui's comments came after he suggested supermarkets limit the number of people entering stores where possible, and recommended the public only shop for groceries once every two to three days. ##Daily Life## Top US infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci made a video appearance during Thursday's NFL draft, thanking the league for adjusting one of the sport's most highly anticipated nights to adhere to social distancing guidelines in light of the coronavirus pandemic. \"I want to commend those involved in these decisions to show that we can have something as important as that in a way that safeguards the life, the safety and the health of the American public by doing the kind of physical separations, doing things virtually, avoiding that kind of contact that puts you at risk,\" Fauci said in his brief video appearance. This year's NFL draft, which was originally supposed to take place in Las Vegas, is being held virtually because of the Covid-19 pandemic, with league commissioner Roger Goodell announcing draft picks from his basement. \"I know it's unusual, I know it disturbs the normal pattern but it really is for your good and the good of the country,\" Fauci said. \"So the best thing we can do now is hope for the best and hope that's sooner or later -- hopefully sooner -- we can get back to some form of normality where we can all enjoy the sport that we love so much.\" Read more: ##Daily Life## The novel coronavirus has now infected more than 2.7 million people worldwide and killed at least 190,000. If you're just joining us now, here are the latest developments: US stimulus: The US House of Representatives approved a $480 billion package to help small businesses and hospitals and expand testing. The package was approved by the Senate earlier this week, and now goes to President Trump, who has indicated that he will sign it.\nUnemployment hits: The stimulus package comes amid an unemployment crisis. A total of 26.5 million Americans have filed unemployment claims since mid-March.\nPompeo blames Beijing: China \"caused an enormous amount of pain, loss of life,\" with its handling of coronavirus and the \"Chinese Communist Party will pay a price,\" the top US diplomat told Sean Hannity’s show on Fox.\nEU stimulus: The European Union also agreed on a massive stimulus package on Thursday, worth trillions of euros. But there were disagreements on \"coronabonds,\" a controversial debt-pooling instrument.\nSouth Korea milestone: The country recorded no new coronavirus deaths yesterday for the first time in 40 days.\nLifting restrictions: US states like Alaska and Georgia, and countries including the Czech Republic, are beginning to loosen restrictions. This means allowing businesses to reopen, letting people move around more, and limited social gatherings.\nBut the crisis is far from over. May will be a \"decisive\" month for New York City, its mayor said. Experts warned we are possibly months away from finding a drug that can fight the virus. And with fears running high in India, Muslims are finding themselves targeted in Islamophobic attacks. For the past week it's been the question which has raged around the world -- where in Wuhan did the novel coronavirus originate? The most common explanation is that the virus jumped from animals to humans in the Wuhan seafood market, where wild animals were being stored in unhygienic conditions alongside humans. But in the past week, the United States government, and especially allies of President Donald Trump, have been suggesting the virus escaped from either the Wuhan Institute of Virology or perhaps the nearby Chinese Centers for Disease Control laboratory where it was being studied. \"I would just say, at this point, it's inconclusive although the weight of evidence seems to indicate natural (origin). But we don't know for certain,\" Joint Chief of Staff Chairman Mark Milley told reporters on April 14. The Chinese government has strongly denied the accusation. \"The head of the World Health Organization has repeatedly stated that there hasn't been any evidence pointing to the virus being lab-created,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said on April 16. CNN requested to visit the Institute of Virology lab or to speak to a spokesperson during our trip to Wuhan but were not given access.

Mike Dunleavy at a news conference on Thursday. He also encouraged residents to leave town if they wanted to, since movement restrictions will also be lifted. \"You can get in your car and go for a ride,\" he said.  Under the loosened restrictions, restaurants can resume table service but are limited to 25% capacity with 10 feet (3 meters) between each table. Only family members can sit together. Salons will accept customers by appointment only.  The city of Anchorage, where 40% of the state's residents live, is putting off the looser restrictions until Monday.  Dunleavy did warn that people shouldn't expect a quick return to ordinary life. \"We're preparing for a world in which we have to incorporate this new disease into our daily lives,\" he said. He also acknowledged that opening up the economy is likely to involve more spread of the virus. \"Unfortunately, there will be deaths, as there have been with car accidents and cancers and strokes,\" he said. ##Daily Life## ##Business## Japan reported 434 new coronavirus cases and 19 related deaths on Thursday, according to the country's health ministry. The ministry also added 85 deaths and 34 infections to the nationwide totals, which had been previously missed. The discrepancy was found when officials re-examined information received from local governments. This brings the country's total to 13,100 cases and 330 deaths, according to the health ministry. ##Health## US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has criticized China previously for its handling of coronavirus, but tonight he was clearer than ever, saying, \"China caused an enormous amount of pain, loss of life, and now a huge challenge for the global economy and the American economy as well by not sharing the information they had.\" Pompeo, appearing on Sean Hannity’s show on Fox, added, \"I am very confident that the Chinese Communist Party will pay a price for what they did here, certainly from the United States.\" Pompeo has previously said \"there'll be a time for recriminations\" when asked if China should pay for the damage of the pandemic, but his language tonight is more direct in saying they will pay a price. The top US diplomat said, \"You should know we still don't have full transparency from the Chinese Communist Party, we are concerned there are things we don't know and we haven't been able to get our team on the ground to do the work that it needs to do.\" European Union leaders agreed on Thursday to create a massive coronavirus recovery fund worth trillions rather than billions of euros. But they did not endorse \"coronabonds,\" the controversial debt-pooling instrument that countries such as Italy and Spain hoped for. French President Emmanuel Macron said it was critical that the EU worked together in the face of the crisis, warning that \"if we abandon part of Europe, all of Europe will fall.\" Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, a fierce critic of the Europe-wide response to the pandemic that has hit his country so hard, expressed satisfaction with Thursday’s virtual summit. He said the Council's decision to launch the recovery fund was \"important\" to help some of the hardest-hit countries. \"It's important because this is a necessary and urgent tool. It is absolutely necessary Italy is the first in line to ask for this,\" he said in a short video statement. Coronabond controversy: The leaders agreed that the financing would be built into the EU’s next seven-year budget, rather than special instruments including the so-called \"coronabonds.\" Macron explained resistance to coronabonds by saying: \"There is a consensus on the need for a strong, coordinated response of around 5 to 10 points of GDP, but there are disagreements on the means. Not to be too technical, but one of the questions is: Should the European debt serve to finance loans or real money transfers? If the European Union increases its debt to finance loans, this is insufficient. Because they would only be creating more debt to the countries they would be granting loans to.\" ##Business## The Czech government on Thursday laid out its plans to lift restrictions that had been imposed to curb the spread of coronavirus. Starting Monday, some shops, gyms without locker rooms and showers, libraries and outdoor areas in zoos and botanical gardens will be reopened.  Religious services for a maximum of 15 people will also be allowed.  From May 11, all shops in shopping malls and those larger than 2,500 square meters (26,900 sq ft) will reopen, as will restaurants, bars and cafes that have outdoor patios. Hairdressing salons, barber shops, beauty salons, massage parlors, museums and galleries will also open on May 11.  From May 25, hotels, theaters, tattoo and piercing parlors will reopen, and weddings \"under specific hygienic terms\" will be allowed to go ahead, the statement says.  The Czech Republic has reported 7,187 coronavirus cases, including 210 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. ##Daily Life## ##Business## South Korea recorded no deaths from the coronavirus on Thursday for the first time in 40 days, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday. The country also recorded a fourth consecutive day of single-digit new cases, suggesting a potential slowdown of the outbreak. The country has now reported 10,708 cases, according to Johns Hopkins University.  According to the KCDC, fewer than 2,000 of those are active cases, with the majority of total infected patients having recovered. The country's government has been among the most ambitious when it comes to providing the public with free and easy testing options. Experts have attributed South Korea's decline in new cases to its early testing efforts, a successful example of what is now commonly referred to as \"flattening the curve.\" ##Health## Hawaii’s state tourism agency, typically dedicated to welcoming visitors, is now paying for them to leave. The Hawaii Tourism Authority has set aside $25,000 for the costs of sending tourists away if they refuse to abide by the state’s 14-day quarantine. Outbound travel arrangements are being handled by the non-profit group Visitor Aloha Society, the state said in a news release. Nineteen people have been flown back to their airports of origin since the beginning of the outbreak. In some cases, the violators have been prosecuted for misdemeanors and forced to pay a fine.  The Visitor Aloha Society arranges for the travel back home, and pays for the ticket if the visitor can't afford it.  ##Travel## The United States has reported at least 868,395 cases of the novel coronavirus, including 49,861 related deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. At least 25,090 new cases and 3,071 deaths have been reported so far on Thursday.  The totals include cases from all 50 states, the District of Columbia and other US territories, as well as repatriated cases and those in the US military. CNN is tracking US coronavirus cases here: ##Health## Hafiz Mohammed Naseerudin says that after a police officer assaulted him for being a Muslim and blamed him for spreading the coronavirus, he was left lying on the road for almost an hour. Naseerudin, 44, had gone to pick up some vegetables from his friend's house in Humnabad, in the southern Indian state of Karnataka, when he says an officer stopped him on his scooter. Other vehicles were on the road, Naseerudin says -- he believes he was stopped because of his religion. \"I am an imam, so I look and dress very Muslim. I also have a long beard,\" he says. \"The cop started hitting me and saying that it is because of me and my community that this disease is spreading.\" Nagesh D L, police superintendent of Bidar district where Humnabad is located, says the officer has been suspended while an inquiry was conducted into the incident. Naseerudin says he called the police from hospital to make a statement, but Nagesh claims they did not receive any complaint. Naseerudin is not alone: As fears over the coronavirus mount in India, some Muslims, who make up roughly 200 million of the country's 1.3 billion population, have been targeted in Islamophobic attacks and accused of spreading the virus. In the capital New Delhi, volunteers distributing ration kits to Muslim families say they face harassment from police and are scared to go out. In Punjab, Muslim milk producers say they have been threatened by villagers, their houses have been raided by police, and people are scared to buy their produce. While these incidents have been mostly isolated, the virus fears are only amplifying existing prejudices, playing into growing Hindu nationalism which in recent years has seen India's Muslim societies increasingly marginalized.

The mayor said the reopening process will be done in slow, careful stages. De Blasio rehashed the city’s \"aggressive\" plan to get testing done by hopefully the hundreds of thousands, and reiterated that the federal government needs to help the city in terms of testing resources. The testing sites the city set up in minority communities are seeing a good response, he said, adding that new sites he previously announced will come online soon, including those in New York City Housing Authority communities.  De Blasio also added that the \"status quo before Covid-19 is not acceptable to me,\" addressing the racial disparity he says has been exposed by the virus. ##Health## The world is \"weeks to months\" away from knowing what drugs will work to fight Covid-19, said Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, the technical lead for the World Health Organization's coronavirus response. The WHO is tracking a number of studies that are trying to determine exactly how many people have been infected around the world, Van Kerkhove said. According to one study in Germany, the number of people who have antibodies that show they've had the coronavirus infection ranges from 2% or 3% up to 14% of the population, she said during CNN's coronavirus town hall earlier tonight.  \"What’s interesting about this is that these numbers, this seroprevalence, is a lot lower than some of the earlier models had predicted that would have suggested that this virus was circulating a lot more, and that much more of the population was already infected.\" Van Kerkhove said. \"So these studies right now are not actually showing us that.\" Seroprevalence is the number of people in a population who test positive for a disease. The WHO is also closely monitoring the hundreds of Covid-19 drug trials. \"Everyone in the world wants to know which drugs, which medications are going to work, which medications are going to save lives,\" Van Kerkhove said. \"Unfortunately, right now, we don't have any evidence one works, yet.\" It’s critical that the studies are done and done well, Van Kerkhove said. \"So we can get to the answer that everybody needs,\" she said. The results, she added, \"can't come soon enough.\" But the world is \"weeks to months\" from knowing what works. ##Health## The first city in the world to go into lockdown due to the coronavirus is slowly returning to something that might be described as normal, after months of fear and anxiety. But the scars of the viral outbreak which for 76 days shut down the Chinese city of Wuhan, and much of the surrounding Hubei province, lie just beneath the surface, with many citizens worried about a second outbreak and businesses still struggling to get back on their feet. CNN international correspondent David Culver, now in Wuhan, joined CNN's global town hall earlier Thursday to talk about the city's reopening.  \"You will notice, looking at the windows here, many of those stores are still closed. They still have these steel garage door-like gates down ... There is concern from the customer side of things that they can walk into a store without facing any potential exposure,\" he said. Fewer than half of the stores he saw had reopened, and major brands that have resumed business did so with some modifications, Culver said. The stores have moved products to the front, and changed their procedures, to reduce interactions between customers and staff and keep stores as uncrowded as possible.

The sharp increase was not caused by a new outbreak, health minister Juan Carlos Zevallos said during a news conference on Thursday. Zevallos said it was due to a backlog of tests in the country's laboratories, which left thousands of tests unprocessed. Ecuador is one of the countries that has been hit hardest by coronavirus in Latin America. The country has the second highest number of cases behind Brazil, where more than 49,000 cases have been confirmed, including 3,313 deaths. ##Health## The US House of Representatives voted on Thursday to approve a roughly $480 billion package to deliver aid to small businesses and hospitals and expand Covid-19 testing -- the latest attempt by lawmakers to blunt the devastating impact of the pandemic. The vote was 388-5 and passed with overwhelming bipartisan support.  The measure passed the Senate earlier this week and will now go to US President Donald Trump, who has expressed support for the legislation and indicated that he will sign it.  Where the money is expected to go: $310 billion will go to the Paycheck Protection Program, which was set up to help small businesses struggling from the economic deep freeze triggered by coronavirus. Funding for the program ran dry earlier this month, prompting an outcry from the business community. Some $75 billion will go to hospitals and health care providers to address coronavirus expenses and lost revenue, and $25 billion to facilitate and expand Covid-19 testing. The increased funding for testing comes at a time when there is widespread recognition that testing capacity must increase and improve as states consider when to reopen businesses and lift lockdowns. Referred to as an \"interim\" measure by lawmakers, the legislation is the latest historic effort by Washington to prop up the economy on the heels of a more than $2 trillion rescue package along with other relief measures already approved by Congress. ##Business## ##Daily Life## For the fifth week in a row, millions of American workers applied for unemployment benefits, seeking financial relief as businesses remained closed during the coronavirus pandemic. First-time claims for unemployment benefits totaled 4.4 million in the week ending April 18, after factoring in seasonal adjustments, said the US Department of Labor. In total, 26.5 million people have filed first-time claims since mid-March as the coronavirus pandemic is forcing businesses to close and lay off workers. Numbers at that level reflect a devastating blow to workers, indicating roughly 16.2% of the US labor force is suffering from layoffs, furloughs or reduced hours during the coronavirus pandemic. Early studies have shown lower-income workers are particularly affected by job losses, and minorities, specifically black and Hispanic families, are expected to bear the brunt of the economic cost of this crisis.
