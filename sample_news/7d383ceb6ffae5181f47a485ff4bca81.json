{"Type": "article", "Time": "2021-01-25", "Headline": "January 26 coronavirus news", "Text": "AstraZeneca’s chief executive Pascal Soriot has defended the pharmaceutical giant’s decision to prioritize vaccine deliveries to the United Kingdom, after the European Union voiced growing frustration over delivery delays. “The UK agreement was reached in June, three months before the European one. As you could imagine, the UK government said the supply coming out of the UK supply chain would go to the UK first,” Soriot told Italian newspaper la Repubblica on Tuesday.\n“The contract with the UK was signed first and the UK, of course, said ‘you supply us first,’ and this is fair enough. This vaccine was developed with the UK government, Oxford and with us as well,” he added.  Earlier on Monday, EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides expressed dissatisfaction on talks with AstraZeneca, saying that the drugmaker \"intends to supply considerably fewer doses in the coming weeks than agreed and announced\" due to production problems.   Speaking to la Repubblica, Soriot conceded that the company had to reduce supply to the EU as a result of reduced yields early in the manufacturing process at one site in Europe. “It's complicated, especially in the early phase where you have to really kind of sort out all sorts of issues. We believe we've sorted out those issues, but we are basically two months behind where we wanted to be,” Soriot said.  He added that they also faced \"teething issues\" with the UK supply chain -- but they had a \"head start\" since they signed the contract earlier, and had more time to \"fix all the glitches.\" European delays: So far, the EU has ordered 300 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine -- which could be approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) as soon as this week -- with an option to purchase an additional 100 million doses.  With production issues centered around AstraZeneca’s European plants, Soriot said the company could soon be able to begin using its UK site to help Europe once the UK has “reached a sufficient number of vaccinations.”  “We're moving very quickly, the supply in the UK is very rapid. The government is vaccinating 2.5 million people a week, about 500,000 a day, our vaccine supply is growing quickly,” he told the Italian newspaper. “As soon as we can, we'll help the EU,” he added. ##Vaccines## The Wisconsin State Senate voted Tuesday to repeal Gov. Tony Evers’ statewide mask mandate, with a crucial vote scheduled in the State Assembly on Thursday morning, according to state legislature’s online records.  The resolution, sponsored by 29 Republicans, aims to declare the public health emergency unlawful and terminate all actions included in the Democratic governor’s most recent executive order, the joint resolution states. Evers’ most recent executive order, issued January 19, calls for face coverings to be worn by all people over age 5 when they are in indoor or enclosed public spaces with other people in the same room.  The resolution passed the Senate 18-13 on Tuesday, with two Republican lawmakers opposing the measure, according to online records, and moves onto the Republican-majority Assembly Thursday. A team of World Health Organization (WHO) investigators is preparing to leave quarantine in the Chinese city of Wuhan and begin a long-awaited investigation into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic. Members of the 13-person international team will finish their two-week quarantine in the next 24 hours, stepping out into a city that was once the center of the global outbreak but is now, a year on, largely returned to normal. Scrutiny of the team's work will be immense, as they navigate what is likely to be a political minefield in uncovering how the virus that brought much of the world to a halt first emerged. \"The eyes of the world are focused on this, the opinions of the world are focused on this,\" Dutch virologist and team member Marion Koopmans told CNN Wednesday morning, as she prepared for a final round of meetings before leaving her quarantine hotel.\n\"We are aware of it, there is no way around that. That's why we really try to keep focused, we are scientists, we are not politicians, we are trying to really look at this from the scientific perspective.\" Part of that involves abandoning all preconceived notions about how the virus evolved and spread, to look at what the evidence says, and go from there, Koopmans said. The team has spent the past two weeks in video calls with each other and Chinese scientists, \"discussing what we know, what we don't know.\" Demand for answers will be great, especially after the investigation itself was delayed several times, but Koopmans cautioned patience. \"I think we really have to manage expectations, if you look at some of the earlier quests for the origins of outbreaks, they have taken years to complete,\" she said. \"The early and relatively easy studies have been done, have already been published.\" An earlier report by a WHO team in China, published in February 2020, found that \"key knowledge gaps remain\" about the virus, though it endorsed previous findings that the virus appeared to have originated in animals, with the likely first outbreak at a seafood market in Wuhan. Read the full story: A draft of the first national mask evaluation standard for consumer masks obtained by CNN shows proposed guidance would call for two tiers of certification. A level one mask would require the product to filter 20% of particles -- something that would make the mask easy to breathe through, but that would provide minimal protection.\nA level two mask would require \"high performance\" filtration of at least 50% of particles, but would provide less breathability. The standards are currently in development with ASTM International and the National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory, which is an arm of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. The current standards: Currently, only medical-grade masks and respirators must meet standards. These include N95 masks, which are regulated for fit, filtration efficiency, flammability and other qualities. The new standards: The proposed standards will outline specific fit, design, performance and testing requirements for face masks and coverings, according to a draft of the standards provided to CNN by ASTM International.  The draft evaluates both single use and reusable masks, and outlines specific requirements. For instance, the standards would prohibit the use of vents, valves or any feature that allows air flow to bypass filtration -- though there are exceptions to this that reflect current CDC guidance. The review process is ongoing, and these guidelines are subject to further review and change. The drafted guidelines will be further reviewed next week. International standards: The ASTM draft standard currently is far different from standards required for masks in several European countries. Germany, Austria and France are now requiring people wear masks with a minimum filtration efficacy of 80-90% while on public transport, shopping or in public areas.  A pharmacist in Wisconsin has signed a plea deal acknowledging he was guilty of trying to render hundreds of Covid-19 doses ineffective, according to the Department of Justice of the Eastern District of Wisconsin.  Steven Brandenburg removed 57 vials of the Moderna vaccine from cold storage on December 24 and 25, knowing that it would render them unusable, according to police statements. His actions destroyed all 57 vials; each vial contained 10 individual doses of the vaccine for a total of 570 doses. \"Brandenburg is charged by an Information with two counts of attempting to tamper with consumer products, with reckless disregard for the risk that another person will be placed in danger of death or bodily injury. Brandenburg has agreed to plead guilty to the charges, which each carry a maximum sentence of ten years' imprisonment,\" read the news release from the Department of Justice.  United States Attorney Matthew D. Krueger said the charges show that the Justice Department will pursue anyone who tampers with the vaccine, and especially any medical professional.  \"Tampering with vaccine doses in the midst of a global health crisis calls for a strong response, as reflected by the serious charges the United States has brought today,\" said Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian Boynton of the Department of Justice's Civil Division. \"The claims made in the Information are allegations that, if the case were to proceed to trial, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt to convict the defendant. The plea agreement expresses the defendant's intention to plead guilty, but the defendant has not yet formally entered a plea in this matter,\" read the release. ##Vaccines## The former president and CEO of the Great Canadian Gaming Corporation and his wife are facing charges -- including failure to self-isolate -- after allegedly chartering a plane to a small town in western Canada and posing as local workers to receive the coronavirus vaccine. Rodney and Ekaterina Baker have been charged under Yukon's Civil Emergency Measures Act (CEMA), according to court documents. Yukon Community Services Minister John Streicker said the couple showed up at a mobile clinic last Thursday in Beaver Creek, home to an indigenous community. One of them presented a British Columbia health care card, the other had one from Ontario, Streicker said in a statement. The Bakers weren't charged for getting the vaccine. Rather, they were accused of not following quarantine requirements after arriving in the Canadian territory. According to a charging document, the Bakers are from Vancouver, British Columbia, southeast of the Yukon territory. \"I am outraged by this selfish behaviour, and find it disturbing that people would choose to put fellow Canadians at risk in this manner,\" Streicker said. \"Reports allege these individuals were deceptive and violated emergency measures for their own advantage, which is completely unacceptable at any time, but especially during a public health crisis.\" CNN was unable Tuesday to reach the Bakers for comment. Read the full story: Washington state Gov. Jay Inslee confirmed Tuesday that states were told to expect an increase in Covid-19 vaccine doses starting next week.  “Having a 16% increase is really great news,” said Inslee. “It’s also great news that they’re giving us certainty of those deliveries, because our providers have been bedeviled with uncertainty and unpredictability of the delivery schedules.” The state of Washington topped 500,000 total vaccine doses on Monday, and Inslee said they are on their way to meeting the larger goal of vaccinating an average of 45,000 people per day.  “These measures are working,” the governor said. “We certainly have a long way to go, but we have made very significant progress in the past week.” ##Vaccines## Several hundred White House employees have now been vaccinated, two administration officials tell CNN, with more expected in the coming weeks. Most officials who have received vaccinations work for the Executive Office of the President, meaning they operate inside the White House complex, either in the West Wing or Eisenhower Executive Office Building next door. Dozens of staffers are still working remotely but the White House is prioritizing vaccinations for people who work on site and aims to eventually vaccinate all in-person staff, an official told CNN. Even with the vaccinations, White House officials are still wearing masks when on the grounds and many are working from home or participating in virtual meetings from their offices.  The staffers, including those who have been working remotely, came to the Eisenhower Executive Office Building today for their first vaccinations. Pfizer said Tuesday it’s “laying the groundwork” to create a vaccine booster that could respond to coronavirus variants.  “We should not be frightened, but I think we need to be prepared,” Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said during the Bloomberg The Year Ahead event Tuesday. “Once we discover something that it is not as effective, we will very, very quickly produce a booster dose that will be a small variation to the current one.”  Bourla said the company had discussed variants in the past and created a process to help it adapt quickly. “We were working on a process that will allow us to do the development very fast,” Bourla said. “Now already we have started implementing this process.”  In a statement to CNN on Tuesday, Pfizer emphasized that the process is to respond, “if a variant of SARS-CoV-2 shows evidence of escaping immunity by our vaccine.”  ��However, the studies needed to evaluate a vaccine that encodes an updated viral antigen have yet to be determined, in agreement with regulators. We will need to generate data that gives confidence that any updated vaccine is safe and effective. The updated vaccine to be administered as a booster would be subject to regulatory approval or authorization,” the statement said. Last week, Ugur Sahin, who helped invent the BioNTech vaccine being made and distributed by Pfizer, tested his vaccine against the B.1.1.7 variant first seen in the UK. The team found “no biologically significant difference in neutralization activity,” they reported in a pre-print report. But they said it would be “prudent” to start tweaking the vaccine, just in case. Vaccine maker Moderna announced on Monday two doses of its vaccine are expected to be protective against emerging strains of coronavirus detected so far, but out of an abundance of caution, it planned to test booster shots. ##Vaccines## New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo responded with relief today to President Biden's announcement that he would purchase 200 million more doses of Covid-19 vaccines, welcoming a \"competent\" federal response. \"You have a competent, professional, federal government that tells the truth,\" said the New York Democrat. \"That's the truth and that's competence and that's taking responsibility.\" Cuomo went on to argue that a number of missteps by the Trump administration had lead to confusion in the Empire State and the general mishandling of the federal response had cost lives.  \"By the federal guidelines 7 million people [in New York] are eligible for the vaccine, but I only get 250,000 dosages,\" Cuomo told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. \"So they told 7 million New Yorkers, 'you're eligible, but it would take seven months for you to get the vaccine.'\"  \"That's just madness,\" continued Cuomo. \"...Look, incompetent government can kill people. This is not a joke. And more people died here than needed to.\" ##Vaccines## Vaccine maker AstraZeneca has confirmed to CNN that a representative of the company will speak Wednesday at an emergency meeting of advisers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. CNN previously reported the upcoming meeting agenda lists an unspecified “COVID-19 Vaccine Manufacturer” in attendance. An AstraZeneca spokesperson did not share further details on what its representative plans to discuss. The CDC advisory group — known as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) — will address a number of topics over the daylong meeting, including progress in administering vaccine doses, safety of the vaccines, testing of the vaccines in children and studies on the effectiveness of the vaccine. ACIP members are not expected to vote during the meeting, said a CDC spokesperson previously. AstraZeneca’s vaccine has not been authorized for emergency use in the United States, but it has in other countries such as the UK and India. In September, its trial was put on pause in the US after a trial volunteer in the UK developed neurological symptoms. The trial resumed in the US about six weeks later, after a review by the US Food and Drug Administration concluded it was safe to do so. ##Vaccines## President Biden announced Tuesday that the US is buying 200 million more doses of coronavirus vaccines, and hopes to have them by summer as part of a package of measures aimed at speeding up and increasing vaccine supply for the US. The US plans to buy 100 million more doses from Pfizer/BioNTech and 100 million more from Moderna, he said. That’s a 50% increase in the order for each vaccine, increasing the planned supply from 400 million to 600 million, Biden said. Pfizer and Moderna are working to step up production. Biden added the additional vaccine supply will be enough to vaccinate 300 million Americans by end of the summer and beginning of the fall. ##Vaccines## The Biden administration announced Tuesday an increase in vaccine supply to states. \"First, after review of the current vaccine supply and manufacturing plants, I can announce that we will increase overall weekly vaccination distributions of states, tribes and territories from 8.6 million doses to a minimum of 10 million doses,\" President Biden said in remarks Tuesday. \"Starting next week. That's an increase of 1.4 million doses per week... You all know that vaccines were distributed to states based on population, based on population. The smaller the state, the less vaccine. The bigger the state, the more they get. And so this is going to allow millions of more Americans to get vaccinated sooner than previously anticipated. We've got a long way to go, though,\" he added. States have been saying they don’t have enough vaccine, and many have also said they have been getting confusing information about how much vaccine they are getting and when from the federal government. The official said the government plans to try to fix this. “And to give state and local leaders the transparency of supply they’ve been asking for, HHS will provide allocation estimates three weeks in advance and the estimates will be updated on a running basis so every state has at least three weeks’ notice to help them plan for their vaccination distribution and administrations,” a senior administration official said. This does not include any extra vaccines that might win emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has granted EUA to two vaccines – one made by Moderna and one by Pfizer with its partner BioNTech. Johnson & Johnson is working on a vaccine and expects to report its results from clinical trials within weeks. “We are obviously hopeful that there will be an additional source of supply. If that is the case, you can be sure we will be taking advantage of that,” the official said. ##Vaccines## Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine wants every kid to be back in school by March 1, he announced in a news conference today. DeWine says his goal is to have anyone who works at a school receive their first dose of the vaccine in the month of February at the very least. School employees in Cincinnati will start receiving their vaccine next week. Ohio is averaging 146,000 first doses of the vaccine being administered a week, DeWine added. Currently, people older than 75 and those with certain medical conditions are able to receive vaccines. On Feb. 1, those 70 and older and employees of K-12 schools will be eligible for the vaccine. Beginning Feb. 8, vaccines will be taken directly to affordable senior housing. DeWine said the state will have an additional 77,000 doses to distribute over the next two weeks, because several nursing home residents and staff opted not to receive the vaccine.  DeWine also said that in light of hospitalizations going down in the state, he is considering lessening the current curfew. If hospitalizations in Ohio stay below 3,500 for seven days straight, the curfew will move to 11p.m. – this could happen as early as this Thursday and will stay in place for at least two weeks. If hospitalizations go below 3,000 for seven days straight, the curfew will move to midnight for at least two weeks, and if hospitalizations go below 2,500 for 7 days straight, the curfew will be completely lifted. Ohio is reporting 4,262 new cases of Covid-19, 88 deaths from Covid-19 and 295 additional hospitalization for a total of 2,964 people currently hospitalized with Covid-19. Note: These numbers were released by Ohio Governor Mike DeWine, and may not line up exactly in real time with CNN’s database drawn from Johns Hopkins University and the Covid Tracking Project. As some elected officials continue to question the timing of the state lifting its stay-at-home order, California Health and Human Services Secretary Dr. Mark Ghaly said in a news conference Tuesday that he believes it was lifted “at the right time.”  “This was not a regional stay-at-home order based on community transmission rates only, it was really focused on what we would see in the hospitals a few weeks out,” Ghaly explained. The state lifted its regional stay-at-home order for all five regions on Monday as health officials now expect the intensive care unit bed capacity to meet the 15% threshold in four weeks. Since health officials look at a four-week projection, Ghaly said that he has previously mentioned that the stay-at-home order can be lifted when hospitals still have a high census of coronavirus patients. “We know today’s cases become hospital cases in about two weeks, ICU cases three to four weeks later, so we want to really determine what the impact is of our current case numbers, our current transmission rates, our current test positivity on where we’re going to be in the hospitals,” Ghaly said. “We have to look about four weeks out.” What the numbers show: The state continues to see a downward trend in its cases, deaths, and hospitalizations. California on Tuesday reported 17,028 new cases of the virus and 409 additional deaths, both numbers well below the 14-day average of 28,993 cases and 501 deaths. The 14-day test positivity rate has also dropped to 9%, a 33% decrease since the state reported its highest percentage earlier this month, according to Ghaly. In the past two weeks, hospitalizations have decreased over 20%.  Today marks the one-year anniversary of when the first two cases of the virus were reported to the California Department of Public Health, one case in Los Angeles County and another in Orange County. In one year, over 37,500 Californians have lost their lives to the virus, which Ghaly called an “immeasurable loss.” To date, California has a total of 3,153,186 coronavirus cases and 37,527 deaths. Note: These numbers were released by the California Department of Public Health and may not line up exactly in real time with CNN’s database drawn from Johns Hopkins University and the Covid Tracking Project.  ##Hotspots## The Biden administration promised on Tuesday to have enough coronavirus vaccine for the entire US population by the end of summer. “Today, the President is announcing bold steps that will help meet the goal of administering 100 million shots in 100 days, and ramp up vaccine supply as fast as possible. As a result of these actions, the federal government will have enough vaccine supply for the entire US population by the end of the summer,” the administration said in a fact sheet.  Among the promised actions: a 50% increase in purchased vaccines from makers Moderna and Pfizer, with 200 million extra doses to be delivered by the end of summer, plus an increase in deliveries to states now from 8.6 million doses a week to 10 million doses a week. “We wish we could say today that every American who wants a vaccine could get one. That’s clearly not the case,” a senior administration official told reporters. “It’s not the level of supply we found when we arrived. It’s going to take a number of months before we can say to American it’s open season, as (Dr. Anthony) Fauci calls it. But with the announcement today, we’ve purchased enough today to vaccinate 300 million Americans.” ##Vaccines##  Federal officials are working to get more supplies of the special syringes needed to obtain extra doses out of vials of Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine, a senior administration official said Tuesday. Pfizer’s vaccine was originally shipped in five-dose vials, but with the right equipment, a sixth dose can be extracted from the vials. The company has now said it will count those bonus doses towards its obligation to the US.  But not everyone has the right syringes to do it. A senior administration official told reporters the federal government has been in active talks about getting more. “This is a somewhat fragile supply chain,” the official said. It is important, the official said, to not disrupt other health care supply needs. The administration will use the Defense Production Act as needed to get the supplies without disrupting other supply chains, the official said. ##Vaccines## More people were reported to have died from Covid-19 during the month of January 2021 than any other month during the pandemic.  According to Johns Hopkins University, 77,698 people have died from Covid-19 so far this month, surpassing the December 2020 total of 77,486 deaths. Here's a month-by-month breakdown of Covid-19 deaths in the US during the pandemic:  February 2020: 1 death \nMarch 2020: 5,277 deaths\nApril 2020: 60,750 deaths\nMay 2020: 41,727 deaths\nJune 2020: 20,138 deaths\nJuly 2020: 26,585 deaths\nAugust 2020: 29,525 deaths\nSeptember 2020: 23,433 deaths \nOctober 2020: 23,995 deaths\nNovember 2020: 37,038 deaths\nDecember 2020: 77,486 deaths\nJanuary 2021: 77,698 deaths so far  Remember: This month’s data is an ongoing tally and only includes Johns Hopkins University data up until this point.  ##Hotspots## President Biden’s Covid coordinator Jeff Zients informed governors on a call this afternoon that Covid-19 vaccine allocations for states would increase by around 16% starting next week, according to a source with knowledge of the call. Zients said on the call that the Moderna vaccine would be up to to 5.7 million doses, while Pfizer could go up by some 4.3 million doses, this source said. Additionally, the Pfizer vaccine shipments would include supplies to extract additional doses so the understanding was that the actual number of available Pfizer vaccine doses to be administered would ultimately be higher than the anticipated 4.3 million doses. The source said that for some of the governors were thrilled because they did not expect to see an increase in vaccine supply for weeks or months – and view this announcement as an immediate increase. ##Vaccines## Vice President Kamala Harris just received her second dose of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland.  \"So I've had the vaccine, and it really was painless, relatively painless. But I want to thank everyone here at NIH for all you do,\" Harris said after she received the shot. Harris' husband Doug Emhoff will also receive a shot today.  Harris went on to deliver brief remarks and shared her personal connection to NIH. As NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins stood on stage with her, she said that her mother would travel to the NIH offices in Bethesda, and was a peer reviewer in the biochemical endocrinology study section. \"My mother had two goals in her life, to raise her two daughters and end breast cancer,\" Harris said.  The vice president praised the efforts of NIH and their scientists, saying that the work that they do to improve public health is an \"essential part of government.\" \"The importance of NIH is that this is about an essential function of government, which is to provide for the public health. The work that happens here has one goal, to improve public health. And the importance of the pursuit of the work that happens at NIH, is that it's not about profit. It's about the people,\" Harris said.  \"I want to say to everyone who works here, I know who you are. I know what you do,\" she added. ##Vaccines## The Federal Bureau of Prisons has delivered the first round of Covid-19 vaccinations to 99 of the 110 facilities across the country, a spokesperson told CNN on Tuesday, and thousands of inmates have received both doses of the vaccine. In collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Operation Warp Speed, last month full-time federal prison employees were given the opportunity to receive the Covid-19 vaccine. Inmates were given the vaccination when additional doses were available.  Since then, \"the BOP administered 17,189 doses of the vaccine. One dose has been administered to 7,576 staff and 5,457 inmates. A completed series of two doses have been administered to 1,027 staff and 1,051 inmates,\" according to a news release issued on January 15.  \"Vaccinating staff protects staff members, inmates at the facility, and the community. Currently, roughly half of the BOP's staff at each of the locations above have been vaccinated,\" Scott Taylor, a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Prisons said. ##Vaccines## Protesters in Lebanon’s city of Tripoli clashed with Lebanese security forces for the second night in a row over deteriorating living conditions exacerbated by a strict weeks-long Covid-19 lockdown. A local TV channel on Tuesday carried live footage showing protesters throwing stones at the main government building, known as the Serail, and burning a vehicle close to it, prompting the Lebanese army to charge toward them and push them away from the building.  Lebanon, which is the throes of a financial meltdown, has seen a surge in Covid-19 cases and deaths in recent months. On Tuesday, the country recorded its highest Covid-19 death toll with 73 deaths in 24 hours, bringing the country’s total deaths to 2,477.  The tiny eastern Mediterranean country leads the Arab world in the number of Covid-19 cases per million people.  Tripoli is considered to be the poorest city on the Mediterranean coast, and has borne the brunt of Lebanon’s financial crisis.  Khaled Kassab, a 24-year-old protester who took part during Monday’s protest, told CNN, “The protesters are back on the streets in Tripoli in particular and in Lebanon in general because of the deteriorating economic situation and the inflation.”  ##Restrictions##  More than 100 million people across the world have been infected by Covid-19, according to Johns Hopkins University.  At least 100,032,461 cases of coronavirus have been recorded across the globe, according to Johns Hopkins. Countries reporting the most Covid-19 cases are: United States\nIndia \nBrazil \nRussia\nUnited Kingdom The United States makes up a quarter of all global cases, with well over 25 million coronavirus cases reported. Global deaths from coronavirus are over two million, with Johns Hopkins reporting at least 2,149,818 fatalities. Countries reporting the most deaths from coronavirus, according to Johns Hopkins, are the United States, Brazil, India, Mexico and the United Kingdom. ##Hotspots## Ireland's Prime Minister Micheál Martin announced new regulations to contain coronavirus, which include a 14-day mandatory quarantine for those traveling from South Africa and South America. “All visa-free short term travel from South Africa and South America is suspended till March 5,” Martin said Tuesday. “Mandatory quarantine at a designated facility will be required of passengers who arrive in breach of the pre-departure negative PCR test requirement.” A PCR test is designed to show whether a person has coronavirus. The regulations will apply to anyone traveling to any port or airport in Ireland, and came with a warning that policing under the new regulations will be increased significantly.  Those in breach of the new law will also be subject to a fine of about $3,000 and possible imprisonment. “People should not be traveling and the government has made a number of decisions to further restrict travel and mitigate the risks of new variants coming into the country,” Martin said before announcing the extension of the national lockdown. “We cannot give the virus or its variants any space, therefore the government has decided to extend the level five restrictions till March 5,” said Martin. He reminded people non-essential travel outside of 3.1 miles is a breach of the level five restrictions and warned those found in breach of the regulations will be subject to an increased fine. ##Restrictions## More than 23.5 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine have been administered in the United States, according to data published Tuesday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  The CDC reported that at least 23,540,994 total doses have been administered, about 53% of the 44,394,075 doses distributed. Nearly 20 million people have received at least one dose of the vaccine, and nearly 3.5 million people have been fully vaccinated, the data shows.  Remember: States have 72 hours to report vaccine data, so data published by the CDC may be delayed – and may not necessarily mean all doses were given on the day reported.  ##Vaccines## White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the Biden administration has already invoked the Defense Production Act to help boost vaccine supply and did so within 24 hours of an executive order Biden signed last week.  “It's already been invoked and underway, so those efforts to ramp up production are already underway. They started as of less than 24 hours after the president signed that executive order and made that announcement last week,” Psaki said at Tuesday’s White House press briefing. She did not say which specific companies are a part of the Administration’s efforts through the DPA. The President on Thursday directed federal agencies to use \"all available legal authorities, including the Defense Production Act\" to boost vaccine supply. ##Vaccines## With the right mitigation strategies, it’s possible to open K-12 schools for in-person learning with minimal Covid-19 transmission, according to a study published Tuesday in the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. The study by researchers from Wisconsin and California examined 17 K-12 schools in rural Wood County, Wisconsin, that conducted in-person learning this fall. It found lower Covid-19 case rates than in the larger community and few cases of in-school transmission.    Of 5,530 students and staff, 191 tested positive for Covid-19. The researchers found that Covid-19 case rates in schools were 37% lower than the surrounding community. Contact tracing and investigation determined that seven of those 191 cases, 3.7%, – all among students – were contracted in school. Three of the seven students who tested positive were from one elementary school class.  The schools did not conduct routine Covid-19 screening, but they implemented mitigation measures. Students were each provided with three to five double- or triple-layered cloth masks. Masks were required in schools and statewide, and more than 92% of students of all age groups wore them. Cohorts of 11 to 20 students from the same grade level met for classes and lunch indoors, where students were often seated next to the same person. Cohorts were asked not to mix, and the researchers found no in-school transmission between different cohorts. Staff were told to mask, social distance and limit time in shared indoor spaces. If a student was out of school with Covid-19 symptoms, their siblings were also told to stay home. When a student or staff member tested positive for the virus, school officials used interviews to identify close contacts – anyone who was within 6 feet of the person for longer than 15 minutes over the course of 24 hours. Those close contacts were required to quarantine at home, and if they developed symptoms during that time, officials investigated whether in-school spread was the cause. The team says their findings suggest that even with varying positivity rates in the community, students are not necessarily at increased risk for the virus if they attend in-person classes. In fact, they say that being in a monitored environment such as the classroom may increase adherence to public health measures. White House press secretary Jen Psaki sought to further couch remarks from President Biden raising the bar from 1 million to 1.5 million vaccines per day.  “The President didn’t actually say, ‘the new goal is.’ The President said, ‘I hope we can do even more than that, and that is certainly, of course, his hope. He is continuing to push our team to get as many Americans vaccinated as quickly as possible,” Psaki said. Biden's official goal on administering vaccines still remains 100 million shots in his first 100 days in office, multiple White House officials, including Psaki said on Tuesda – a day after Biden raised the new 1.5 million doses a day aspiration. That initial goal is enough to cover 50 million Americans with vaccines that require two doses “That’s the number we set, based on the recommendations of health and medical experts, continues to be our goal. But does he want to beat that goal? Of course he does. But again, it is a goal that was set with contingencies,” she said. Psaki also noted this vaccination effort “has literally never been done before.” ##Vaccines## A day after she blamed the Trump administration for making it difficult to get a sense of America’s Covid-19 vaccine supply, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the Biden administration now has a better sense of the country’s current stockpile.  She also indicated that President Biden will make additional vaccine supply available to states later this afternoon. Asked by a reporter during Tuesday’s White House briefing whether the administration has its hands around a number of vaccines, Psaki said, “Well certainly. We monitor updates on a daily basis through Tiberius (analytic platform) and multiple systems that have available information, vaccine numbers that are distributed to states, what states have received, what they have distributed.” “We have been connecting all the dots to ensure we have our best understanding of where the holdups are and we, of course, have that assessment, but we’re continuing to dig in every day and what the issues are. Why isn’t the vaccine getting out to states? What is the holdup with vaccinators? Why aren’t there more vaccine sites that are getting the supply they need?” she continued. Despite the assessment, Psaki wouldn’t give details on a vaccine stockpile number. Psaki also said the President will have more of an update on the stockpile later this afternoon, presumably during his 4:45 p.m. ET Covid-19 remarks, saying that he’ll have more to say on “additional vaccine supply that we’ll make available to states.” Pressed later on why it’s taken so long to get a stockpile number, Psaki defended the administration’s timing. “Well, six days in, the President is also giving an update on steps we're going to take to provide more vaccine supply to states across the country in response to their concern, there has not been a federal plan in place and that they haven't received the coordination, cooperation and information they desired. So, in my view that's a pretty rapid response to states' concerns,” Psaki said.  “We do have an assessment. … (Tiberius) provides vaccine information, publicly available information on vaccine supply that's gone to states and what's been used. It doesn't mean it's perfect. Oftentimes it isn't. But our concerns and our focus is not just on the supply, that's part of the issue, it is also about ensuring that states have the number of vaccinators they need,\" she continued.  ##Vaccines## Vaccine advisers to the World Health Organization said it’s OK to delay the second dose of Moderna’s coronavirus vaccine for as long as six weeks, but recommended against halving doses to try to stretch supply. The recommendations from WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization, or SAGE, closely mirror those made for Pfizer’s vaccine, which uses very similar technology, and recommendations from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Food and Drug Administration. They focus heavily on the scarcity of vaccine and explain the logic behind the recommendations. “Some countries have therefore considered delaying the administration of the second dose to allow for a higher initial coverage. This is based on the observation that efficacy has been shown to be 91.9%, starting 14 days after the first dose, with a median follow-up time of 28 days,” WHO said. “There appears to be protection against COVID-19 disease following one dose; however, there is insufficient information about longer-term protection beyond 28 days after a single dose, as most trial participants received two doses. It is of note that neutralizing antibody responses were modest after the first dose and increased substantially after the second dose,” it added. “WHO’s recommendation at present is that, if judged necessary, the interval between doses may be extended to 42 days. The evidence base for this extension is not strong, but this was the longest interval for any participants in the primary efficacy analyses of the phase 3 trial, though the great majority received the second dose after a shorter interval.” WHO also recommended focusing on vaccinating health workers at high risk of infection and older people. “Protecting high-risk health workers has a threefold purpose: (i) to protect the individual health workers; (ii) to protect critical essential services during the COVID-19 pandemic, and (iii) to prevent onward transmission to vulnerable people. Protecting older people will have the greatest public health impact in terms of reducing the number of deaths,” WHO explained. There’s no data about what happens if people get one dose of one vaccine and then a second dose with a different vaccine. “If different COVID-19 vaccine products are inadvertently administered in the two doses, no additional doses of either vaccine are recommended at this time,” WHO said. WHO also noticed very rare cases of a severe allergic reaction known as anaphylaxis but, like the CDC, says people with known allergies should not avoid the vaccine – unless the allergy is to polyethylene glycol (PEG), a component of the vaccine.  “The vial stoppers are not made with natural rubber latex, and there is no contraindication or precaution to vaccination for persons with a latex allergy. In addition, as mRNA-1273 does not contain eggs or gelatine, there is no contraindication or precaution to vaccination for persons with allergies to any food substances,” it says. “Currently there are no data on the safety or efficacy of vaccination in persons who received monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma as part of COVID-19 treatment. Hence, as a precautionary measure, vaccination should be deferred for at least 90 days to avoid interference of the antibody treatment with vaccine-induced immune responses,” WHO concluded. ##Vaccines## UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he expects and hopes vaccine contracts from manufacturers in the European Union will be honored, after the EU warned it would take action to counter pharmaceutical companies delivering vaccine doses later than contracted.  \"On supply of vaccines from abroad and supply into this country, I’ve got total confidence in our supplies. We’ve been over this many times in the last few days and hours,\" he said. \"I’ve seen what commissioner Kyriakides has said and all I would say is, obviously we expect and hope that our EU friends will honour all contracts and we fully expect that that will happen,” he added.  On Monday, EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides said “the European Union will take any action required to protect its citizens and rights” regarding vaccines. Speaking in Brussels, she said the EU wants \"clarity on transactions and full transparency concerning the export of vaccines from the EU.\" \"In the future, all companies producing vaccines against Covid-19 in the EU will have to provide early notification whenever they want to export vaccines to third countries. Humanitarian deliveries are of course not affected by this,\" she added. ##Vaccines## More than 100,000 people have died in the United Kingdom within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, government data Tuesday showed. The country reported 1,631 new deaths, taking the total to 100,162. The United Kingdom becomes the fifth country in the world to report that many deaths from the pandemic, following the United States, Brazil, India and Mexico, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.  In a statement, UK Health Minister Matt Hancock said the figures were \"heart-breaking,\" adding that the government is working to vaccinate the most vulnerable in society. “The vaccine offers is the way out, but we cannot let up now and we sadly still face a tough period ahead. The virus is still spreading and we’re seeing over 3,500 people per day being admitted into hospital,\" Hancock said. On Tuesday's Downing Street press conference, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was “deeply sorry” for the lives lost adding that he took “full responsibility for everything the government has done.” “We truly did everything that we could and continue to everything that we can to minimize loss of life and minimize suffering at what has been a very, very difficult stage in a very, very difficult crisis for our country,” Johnson said. In the same press conference, Chief Medical Officer for England Chris Whitty commented on the number of people in hospital with the virus saying the number is still at a very high level throughout the country but looks as though it is coming down \"very slightly,\" in some areas including London.  ##Hotspots##  Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said Tuesday it’s important to give the second dose of the company’s Covid-19 vaccine on time, but added that he didn’t think “giving it a week later or two is a very big issue.” “You need to make sure you give the second doses as the studies recommend the vaccine works which is in three weeks,” Bourla said during the Bloomberg The Year Ahead event. “In our study we actually had from 19 to 42. Within this framework, I’m fine. Beyond that, it’s serious.” While the proposed window between doses was 21 days in Pfizer’s vaccine efficacy trial, it still included participants who received their second doses within a “predefined window” of 19 to 42 days, according to FDA materials. There have been concerns that the limited vaccine supply will prevent people from getting their second doses of vaccines on time. Some more context: Last week, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its vaccine guidance to state: ”The second dose should be administered as close to the recommended interval as possible.  However, if it is not feasible to adhere to the recommended interval, the second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines may be scheduled for administration up to 6 weeks (42 days) after the first dose. There are currently limited data on efficacy of mRNA Covid-19 vaccines administered beyond this window. If the second dose is administered beyond these intervals, there is no need to restart the series.” ##Vaccines## Boston Mayor Marty Walsh announced the city will return to \"Phase Three, Step One\" on Monday, after reopening was temporarily paused in December. He made the announcement during a news conference today.  In \"Phase Three, Step One,\" Walsh said the following businesses may reopen at 25% capacity: Indoor recreational and athletic facilities and venues \nIndoor event spaces\nArcades\nIndoor fitness centers and health club\nMovie theaters \nMuseums \nAquariums\nSightseeing tours  \nIndoor historic sites and spaces Gatherings will be limited to 10 people indoors and 25 people outdoors, he added. Walsh confirmed 316 new cases and five new deaths from Covid-19, bringing Boston’s total number of Covid-19 cases to at least 51,506 and at least 1,133 total deaths. Marty Martinez, chief of Boston Health and Human Services, also noted in today’s press conference that Massachusetts changed the vaccine prioritization to allow people 75 and older to be eligible to receive the vaccine starting next week. Note: These numbers were released by Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, and may not line up exactly in real time with CNN’s database drawn from Johns Hopkins University and the Covid Tracking Project. ##Restrictions## Authorities in Berlin will now require citizens to take a second coronavirus test in order to better detect new variants of the virus, a spokesperson for Berlin’s Health Minister Dilek Kalayci said Tuesday.  According to the spokesperson, the new strategy will be implemented from the first week of February and will apply to all tests carried out in the city of Berlin.  A spokesperson for the Berlin Senate added that the new measure is to be enforced in an effort to prevent the closure of further hospitals in the city.  Some background: The move comes just days after the Vivantes Humboldt-Klinikum hospital in Berlin was placed under quarantine following an outbreak among both patients and staff of the coronavirus variant first detected in the UK.  As of Tuesday, 24 cases of the UK variant have been detected at the hospital, including 13 patients and 11 members of staff, the hospital confirmed. In a different Berlin hospital — the Klinikum Spandau — two additional cases have been identified in patients.  Since the start of the pandemic, the number of people infected with coronavirus in Germany has reached 2,158,407 and 53,317 have died, according to figures from John Hopkins University. ##Vaccines## ##Variants## Johnson & Johnson told investors it expects to share further details on its Phase 3 Covid-19 vaccine study results by early next week. “Stay tuned,” said Alex Gorsky, chief executive officer and chair of Johnson & Johnson’s board of directors, during the company’s earnings call Tuesday. Gorsky said that the company is “hopeful” that the efficacy and safety data from the earlier trials is a “good precursor” to the kind of data in the larger population in its Phase 3 trial.  “We won’t know for certain, but we remain optimistic,” Gorsky said. Results from J&J's Phase 1/2a trials showed that a single dose of the vaccine induced a strong immune response in nearly all the people who got the vaccine. The immune response was similar across the age groups, according to the company. If J&J’s trial shows its vaccine is effective, it could help speed up the slow US vaccine rollout. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine is one dose, while the authorized vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna require two doses three to four weeks apart. Johnson & Johnson is also testing a dual dose in a separate trial and said it should have data on that toward the end of the year.  The company also said it’s watching closely how its vaccine protects against variants. Joseph Wolk, J&J’s executive vice president and chief financial officer, said that the company is currently “on track” to meet its manufacturing commitments to the US, EU and to developing countries.  “There’s still some fluidity with respect to timelines,” Wolk said.  Earlier, J&J committed to producing and deploying at least a billion doses of vaccine during the calendar year, including at least 100 million doses to the US population. Because the company doesn’t have the results yet, it said it was “premature to speculate” on the financial impact from the potential distribution of its Covid-19 vaccine candidate. “I'm proud of the progress of our Covid-19 vaccine candidate. And the fact that we move so quickly while maintaining the highest level of science and safety standards,” said Gorsky. “Johnson & Johnson was built for times like these.”  ##Vaccines## New York City only has 7,710 doses on hand, and 72,409 second doses yet to be scheduled, Mayor Bill de Blasio said today. “We have almost no supply to allow us to create new opportunities for people, new appointments for people,\" the mayor said. He added “right now I need hundreds of thousands of more doses per week.” He said earlier that the city has administered over 650,000 doses. De Blasio spoke this morning with the White House Covid-19 coordinator and is “very convinced” that the commitment is there and “we're going to see a lot of impact from the Biden White House.” “Right now we are dealing with the residue of what was left to us previously,” the mayor said. De Blasio is calling for even more flexibility to get as many shots in arms as possible. What the numbers look like: New York City added 4,844 new confirmed and probable cases, marking a 8.4% positivity – both on a seven-day rolling average.  The mayor said 230 patients were admitted to NYC hospitals for suspected Covid-19 – a 5.14 per 100,000 person hospitalization rate. ##Vaccines## New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said his state needs many more doses of Covid-19 vaccine to keep up with a plan to vaccinate 70% of the state population within six months. \"We need more doses,\" Murphy said Tuesday morning on ABC's Good Morning America. \"We need probably 2 or 3 times the weekly dosage that we're getting right now.\" Though the state has built a network of some 270 vaccine distribution sites, including 6 so-called \"megasites,\" Murphy said there was insufficient supply to meet demand. A spokesperson for the New Jersey Department of Health confirmed to CNN Tuesday morning that the Meadowlands mega site is temporarily closed due to lack of vaccine, a reality Murphy acknowledged later Tuesday morning in an appearance on MSNBC. \"We've had some amount of having to shut down a location here or there,\" Murphy said. \"Thats something we want to minimize, as you can imagine.\" Murphy said 2.2 million New Jerseyans have pre-registered to receive a Covid-19 inoculation. \"The constraint right now is supply,\" he said. ##Vaccines## Because Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine vials are able to yield six doses, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla says the United States’ contracted 200 million doses can be fulfilled two months earlier than expected.  “In the US, we had promised to provide 100 million doses by the end of the first quarter and we will be able to provide 120 right now. The same is with second quarter. We were planning to provide them all the way to 200 million doses by the end of the second quarter, actually beginning of the third. Right now, we will be able to provide the 200 million doses two months earlier,” said Bourla during the Bloomberg The Year Ahead event. Some background: Each vial of Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine was designed to contain five doses, but after some pharmacists reported they could to extract six doses, the FDA allowed an updated label that states: “After dilution, vials of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine contain six doses of 0.3mL of vaccine. Low dead-volume syringes and/or needles can be used to extract six doses from a single vial. If standard syringes and needles are used, there may not be sufficient volume to extract a sixth dose from a single vial.” Bourla previously said that this increase in doses per vial, “provides an additional 20% capacity.”  Pfizer told CNN on Friday that the company planned to base its vaccine commitment to the US government on doses, not vials, meaning it would count any extra doses that pharmacists can squeeze out of each vial. A source familiar with the matter told CNN last week that Pfizer and the federal government will be keeping track of the sites with the ability to extract the full six doses and Pfizer will not charge for the extra dose per vial if sites aren’t able to extract it. ##Vaccines## Officials with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are closely watching at least four coronavirus variants.  Here's what we know so far about them: Officials in Minnesota announced Monday they detected the P.1 variant of the virus in a traveler from Brazil. It appears to be more easily transmissible. Until Monday, it had only been reported in Brazil and among a group of four travelers from Brazil to Japan.\nThe B.1.1.7 variant, which was first spotted in the UK, has been detected in more than 20 states. The variant appears to spread more easily, and has also been found in at least 60 countries worldwide, according to the World Health Organization.\nThe 1.351 variant was first spotted in South Africa in October and has now been found in more than a dozen countries. Emerging evidence from last week suggested that this variant could be problematic for vaccines. (But note: In both studies, the work was done in the lab and not in people, so more research is needed to gauge the true threat of the new variant.)\nFinally, there's the L425R variant seen in California, that may or may not be driving renewed spread there. \"We don't know yet what the significance of that one is,\" said Gregory Armstrong, who directs the Office of Advanced Molecular Detection at CDC. It also has a mutation in the receptor binding domain of the spike protein.  You can read more about the variants here. ##Variants## Today, the historic Indian Treaty Room in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building will double as a vaccination clinic for dozens of West Wing and National Security Council staff invited to receive the Covid vaccine, according to an email from the “Covid-19 Operations Team” reviewed by CNN.  Officials have been told to report to the room where the White House Medical Unit will be administering the Pfizer vaccine to officials who present a valid government ID. The NSC and much of the West Wing has been ordered to telework since President Joe Biden took office, enforcing stricter Covid-prevention protocols than those of the previous administration.  However for the NSC staff, who rely heavily on classified information to carry out their work, teleworking is far from ideal and there is now a rush to have staff vaccinated and back in the office to access the sensitive information that is critical to their work. Several staffers, who are “holdovers” from the previous administration, already received the first dose of the vaccine before Trump left office, but most of those officials have also been ordered to telework indefinitely while the new administration decides on its Covid work protocols, according to several administration officials. ##Vaccines## Brazil has temporarily banned the entry of foreign travelers who have passed through South Africa into the country.  Direct flights from South Africa or flights passing through the country are now prohibited entry in Brazil. Similar restrictions had already been applied back in December for passengers and flights from the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland. The measures aim to prevent the spread of new variants of coronavirus found in these countries.  The ban is \"on a temporary basis\" and has no defined duration. Foreigners or nationals that are coming from those countries, or have passed through them in the past 14 days, would have then to quarantine for that period in countries that Brazil hasn’t yet declared banned before entering the county.  The request to present a negative RT-PCR test result from not more than 72 hours prior to embarking is valid for all passengers, nationals and foreigners, coming from other countries. The new restriction was established in an ordinance published today in Brazil's Official Gazette (DOU). The measure also renews the ban of entry via land or sea by any foreign travelers, which has been in force since March. ##Variants## ##Restrictions## Airlines UK, the trade body representing airlines such as British Airways and Virgin, said the UK has already “introduced some of the highest levels of restrictions in the world” and “further measures would be catastrophic”. Responding to speculation about further restrictions being put in place for international arrivals into the UK, Airlines UK in a joint statement with the Airport Operators Association warned the measures “will impact vital freight and PPE supplies and jeopardise tens of thousands of jobs and the many businesses that depend on aviation.” The UK is set to make an announcement later Tuesday regarding the use of hotel quarantine, according to vaccine minister Nadhim Zahawi. UK Hospitality, which represents hotels tasked with introducing the quarantine plans, told CNN: “It is vitally important that we take steps to enforce existing quarantine and self-isolation arrangements for the UK.”  “We are happy to play a full part in the national effort to help address this crisis. We have the capacity to help and businesses have already had plans in place to ensure their venues are safe,” it added. However the UK association of travel agents, ABTA, says these measures could jeopardize summer vacation bookings. “No one is going to book a summer holiday if they have to quarantine at a hotel when they return,” said ABTA. Travel to and from the UK has been largely limited since the UK suspended its travel corridors earlier in January. British media has reported that the UK government might impose a hotel quarantine on travelers coming from certain countries with known new variants. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said Tehran has approved Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine, adding that Iran hopes to purchase and start joint production in the “near future,\" according to Russian news agency TASS. The announcement comes following talks with Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Moscow, TASS reported.   During a conference on state TV, Iranian health ministry spokeswoman Sima Sadaat Lari said the country recorded 6,420 new daily coronavirus cases on Tuesday, bringing the country's total number of cases to 1,385,706.  Some background on Sputnik V: Russia approved the Sputnik V vaccine in August ahead of large-scale Phase 3 trials, with great fanfare from state TV.\nThe shot showed more than 90% efficacy in trials, according to its makers at the Gamaleya National Center of Epidemiology and Biology.  \nSome experts have accused Russia of cutting corners with its vaccine development for political and PR gain -- a claim Moscow has denied. Read more about Russia's Sputnik V vaccine here: ##Vaccines## South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has expressed concern over “vaccine nationalism” in an address at this year’s virtual Davos summit. While he didn’t identify a specific country, Ramaphosa asserted that wealthy nations had acquired more shots than they need. “The rich countries of the world went out and acquired large doses of vaccines from the developers and manufacturers of these vaccines, and some countries have even gone beyond and acquired up to four times what their population needs, and that was aimed at hoarding these vaccines,” the president said. “This is being done to the exclusion of other countries in the world that most need this.” Ramaphosa called upon governments to “release the excess vaccines that you’ve ordered and hoarded.” “Ending the pandemic worldwide will require greater collaboration on the rollout of vaccines, ensuring that no country is left behind in this effort,” he also said. Ramaphosa -- who is currently chairing the African Union -- said that throughout the pandemic the continent has “acted as one.” He said the continent-wide task force had secured a provisional 270 million doses for African countries from manufacturers. This is in addition to the 600 million doses expected from the WHO-led COVAX initiative.  WHO’s Africa director Matshidiso Moeti said Friday the initial 30 million doses are expected to arrive by March, with the rest by the end of 2021. By the end of the year, the scheme is expected to cover about 20% of the population in African countries, based on two doses per person, she said, adding that healthcare workers and other high-priority groups will be prioritized in the vaccination drive. Ramaphosa said the pandemic has had a “heavy toll” on South Africa, with the country recording around 1.4 million cases and more than 40,000 deaths. ##Vaccines## Johnson & Johnson plans to report out Phase 3 Covid-19 vaccine trial results by early next week, Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk said on CNBC Tuesday.  Wolk told CNBC’s Meg Tirrell the trial was a “very robust 45,000 person study” across eight countries in three different continent” and some that some new strains of the coronavirus were “potentially captured” in the data as there were sites in South Africa and Brazil. About this vaccine: If all has gone well with its clinical trial, Johnson & Johnson's Covid-19 vaccine will likely be the next one available in the United States. Last week, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci said that Johnson & Johnson is \"right around the corner\" from seeking emergency use authorization for its Covid-19 vaccine from the US Food and Drug Administration.  ##Vaccines## Interim results from an ongoing trial show that Regeneron’s monoclonal antibody cocktail prevented Covid-19 among people at high risk of infection, the company said in a news release Tuesday. The study involved 400 people who were exposed to the coronavirus within their households. Half received injections of the antibody therapy, known as REGEN-COV, and half received a placebo, which does nothing. The number of infections was lower among those who received the treatment, and they were all asymptomatic, the company said. Among those who received the therapy, infections lasted no more than one week, while 40% of infections in the placebo group lasted three to four weeks. None of the infected people who received the therapy had high viral loads, while 62% of people in the placebo group who were infected had high viral loads. There was one death and one hospitalization in the group that received the placebo, and no deaths or hospitalizations in the treatment group. \"These data using REGEN-COV as a passive vaccine suggest that it may both reduce transmission of the virus as well as reduce viral and disease burden in those who still get infected,\" Dr. George Yancopoulos, president and chief scientific officer at Regeneron said in a news release. \n\"Even with the emerging availability of active vaccines, we continue to see hundreds of thousands of people infected daily, actively spreading the virus to their close contacts. The REGEN-COV antibody cocktail may be able to help break this chain by providing immediate passive immunity to those at high risk of infection, in contrast to active vaccines which take weeks to provide protection.” Regeneron expects to see the full data on the study early next quarter, and said it will discuss with the US Food and Drug Administration whether to expand the emergency use authorization for the therapy. The EUA allows it to be used to treat people with mild or moderate Covid-19 who are not currently hospitalized, but are at high risk of developing severe symptoms and requiring hospitalization. Eli Lilly and Company announced last week its monoclonal antibody combination therapy, known as LY-CoV555 or bamlanivimab, was found to help prevent Covid-19 among nursing home residents and staff in a Phase 3 trial.  Black and Latino Americans are receiving the Covid-19 vaccine at significantly lower rates than White Americans — a disparity that health advocates blame on the federal government and hospitals not prioritizing equitable access. A CNN analysis of data from 14 states found vaccine coverage is twice as high among White people on average than it is among Black and Latino people.  The analysis found that on average, more than 4% of the White population has received a Covid-19 vaccine, about 2.3 times higher than the Black population (1.9% covered) and 2.6 times higher than the Hispanic population (1.8% covered). Black and Latino Americans are already dying of Covid-19 at three times the rate of White people and being hospitalized at a rate four times higher, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. CNN's findings come as the government struggles with vaccine supply shortages and a chaotic rollout that has caused delays in vaccinating the elderly. The federal government has recommended that states open up vaccination to more groups of people, including everyone 65 and older.  Initial guidance from the CDC had suggested health care workers and elderly in long-term facilities be the first to receive the vaccine. Health experts and advocates say the federal government can help alleviate the disparities by strengthening partnerships with leaders and churches in Black and Latino communities  — and be intentional about not leaving people of color out of vaccination efforts. ##Vaccines## France will maintain about three to four weeks between the two Pfizer/BioNTech doses, Health Minister Olivier Veran said at a Tuesday news conference.  Last week, the French health authority and the French medicine approval agency suggested delaying the second injection as an option to allow more people to get vaccinated.  “Let's not change the injection schedule for the Pfizer vaccine,\" Veran clarified on Tuesday. Veran said French health authorities would not opt to delay the second dose because it would only give a small advantage and because of “the lack of scientific consensus.” In politics you have to choose. And I therefore maintain, on the basis of the information at my disposal, the injection time between two Pfizer injections at 21 or 28 days, that is to say three to four weeks.” Weighing in on the potential delivery delays of the AstraZeneca vaccine -- which still needs European Medicines Agency approval for emergency use -- the minister said any supply issues would impact all member states.  “Each of the 27 countries of the European Union is receiving a proportional number of doses to its population within the population of the European Union and if there are delays, they will be the same for everybody,\" Veran said. The big picture in France: More than 3,000 people are in intensive care units (ICUs) in the country due to severe Covid symptoms for the first time since December 9, according to the latest data from the health agency.  As of Monday evening, there were 3,031 patients in ICUs, the agency said -- an increase of 76 people in 24 hours. There are 26,888 people in hospital, an increase of 531 patients in the past 24 hours. To date, 73,494 have died of Covid-related illnesses in France. French media have been speculating whether President Emmanuel Macron would address the country this week and announce increased restrictions.The Elysée palace press office told CNN on Monday, however, that there were no plans for Macron to make a TV address this week.  His office added that the effectiveness of the current 6 p.m. curfew would be reviewed as planned on Saturday, two weeks after it was imposed nationwide. ##Restrictions## ##Vaccines## South Korea's Pohang City has ordered one member of every household to get tested for Covid-19, a statement from local authorities said on Tuesday. In total, 174,991 households in all districts and two towns in Pohang are subject to this order.  Pohang City recommended that residents in their 20s and 30s should get tested and ordered workers at restaurants and hair salons, as well as regular workers and users of bathhouses and hot springs, to get the test. In a briefing on Monday, Mayor Lee Kang-deok said the administrative order comes as community transmissions continue in the city. Pohang City has reported a total of 400 Covid-19 cases since the outbreak, according to the city’s dashboard. Some background:  Despite being one of the first countries to be hit by the virus, South Korea has managed to avoid stringent lockdowns and has been considered a model for its effective response to the outbreak. \nThis is due to a combination of aggressive testing and sophisticated track and trace techniques. \nBut as the pandemic drags on into winter, the emergence of a so-called \"third wave\" has resulted in an apparently untraceable rise in new infections.\nAccording to the latest data from John Hopkins University, 75,875 people have been infected with coronavirus since the start of the pandemic across South Korea, with 1,371 deaths as a result. Read more about South Korea here: ##Vaccines## ##Restrictions##  The UK��s vaccine minister Nadhim Zahawi said Tuesday that Britain is \"confident\" it will receive all its promised vaccine supplies. In an interview with Sky News, Zahawi said he was sure both Pfizer and AstraZeneca would deliver the supplies needed to meet the UK’s mid-February target to vaccinate the most vulnerable people. Vaccine supply has been a key focus for both the UK and its European counterparts in recent days, with EU officials Monday accusing manufacturer AstraZeneca of providing a \"lack of clarity.\" AstraZeneca said in a statement on Friday that “while there is no scheduled delay to the start of shipments of our vaccine should we receive approval in Europe, initial volumes will be lower than originally anticipated due to reduced yields at a manufacturing site within our European supply chain.” We will be supplying tens of millions of doses in February and March to the European Union, as we continue to ramp up production volumes,” the statement continued. On Monday, AstraZeneca said its CEO Pascal Soriot spoke with the European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. [Soriot] stressed the importance of working in partnership and how AstraZeneca is doing everything it can to bring its vaccine to millions of Europeans as soon as possible,” the statement released on Monday said. Speaking to the BBC on Tuesday, Zahawi acknowledged vaccine supplies “are tight,” calling Pfizer and AstraZeneca \"great corporates\" and that he was \"sure they will deliver for the European Union, and for the United Kingdom, and for the rest of the world.\" Read more about criticism of the vaccine delays here: ##Vaccines## The United States crossed the terrible milestone of 400,000 deaths from coronavirus early last week, and there are currently over 2.1 million reported deaths worldwide, Johns Hopkins University data shows. There are also new variants with mutations that could make Covid-19 even more transmissible and possibly even more deadly. However, there is also encouraging news, with two vaccines authorized for emergency use so far by the US Food and Drug Administration that are safe and very effective. CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen shares how you can address misconceptions about the Covid-19 vaccines when you hear them from friends and neighbors.  CNN: Why is it important for everyone to know what myths are circulating about coronavirus vaccines? Dr. Leana Wen: One of the key principles in public health is that the messenger is often more important than the message. You are the most trusted messenger to someone. It could be your parents, your work colleagues or your friends. Getting people vaccinated is our best hope of ending this pandemic, and we need everyone's help to convince people to do so. CNN: Let's talk about vaccine safety. There must be a lot of myths around that. Wen: A common myth is that getting the coronavirus vaccine will give you coronavirus. I hear this every year when it comes to the flu vaccine, too: Often, patients will say they don't want to get the flu vaccine because they think they'll get the flu from it. Neither is true. If someone is concerned about this, you can say that none of the coronavirus vaccines being tested in the US contains live virus. So it's not possible to get coronavirus from the coronavirus vaccine. Read the full story here: Preliminary estimates indicate the coronavirus variant first identified in the United Kingdom now accounts for between 10 to 20% of new infections in Belgium, officials there say.  Steven Van Gucht, head of Viral Diseases of Sciensano, the Belgian Health Authority, said officials had been seeing more cases of the B.1.1.7 variant during a Tuesday news conference in Brussels.  \"Since the beginning of January we have also seen more and more infections with the British variant, from preliminary estimates up to and including 23 January, about 10 to 20% of the infections. However, there is still a great deal of uncertainty on these figures,\" Van Gucht said.  Some background: Belgium’s borders will close to all but essential travelers for five weeks from Wednesday, Prime Minister Alexander de Croo announced Friday, stressing that the country must “put up a barrier” against the spread of coronavirus.  “From January 27 there will be a temporary ban on recreational and tourist travel, this applies to trips from our country as well,” de Croo said.  “We are not building a wall around our country… we realize that these are very drastic measures, but we have seen in recent weeks that when people travel, that the virus grows,” he added.  Under the new measures, all travelers from the United Kingdom, South Africa and South America will be required to self-isolate for 10 days, and must take a coronavirus test on their first and seventh day of quarantine. “Non-Belgian nationals who enter our country, for example for professional reasons, must be able to show a double test, a negative PCR test before departure and a negative PCR test on arrival,” the Prime Minister outlined. ##Restrictions## ##Variants## European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Covid-19 vaccine firms must deliver on their promises during a special address at this year’s virtual Davos. Europe invested billions to help develop the world’s first Covid-19 vaccines, to create a truly global common good. And now the companies must deliver. They must honor their obligations,” she said. Von der Leyen said that the European Union has helped investing large sums to build research capacities and production facilities early and this is why it will set up a vaccine export transparency mechanism. She added that the bloc is determined to contribute to the vaccine effort but that “it also means business.” Vaccine supply has become a key focus in recent days with EU officials Monday accusing manufacturer AstraZeneca of providing a \"lack of clarity.\" The drugmaker said in a statement Friday that “while there is no scheduled delay to the start of shipments of our vaccine should we receive approval in Europe, initial volumes will be lower than originally anticipated due to reduced yields at a manufacturing site within our European supply chain.”  ##Vaccines## Colombian Defense Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo died on Tuesday after being diagnosed with Covid-19, his brother Jose Renan Trujillo said on Twitter.  \"It is with deep sorrow that I report the news of my brother’s passing. He fought for his convictions and died defending them,” Trujillo wrote. The 69-year-old minister was admitted to the military hospital in Bogota on January 18 after being diagnosed with the coronavirus six days earlier.  He was being treated in the intensive care unit for Covid-19-related complications, according to a government statement.  Colombian President Ivan Duque put Luis Fernando Navarro, a military commander, in charge of the country's defense ministry a few days ago. Colombia has reported 2,027,746 coronavirus cases to date, according to Johns Hopkins University data. A Chinese woman received a one-year suspended sentence for flying from the US to China in March last year while showing Covid-19 symptoms. The woman, identified as Li Jie in court documents, is a resident of Massachusetts, and her family had been living and working in the US, according to Beijing's Shunyi District court. In early March 2020, the woman showed signs of fever, fatigue, and other Covid-19 symptoms and got tested for the virus on March 11.\nBefore the test result came out, the woman returned to China from Boston with her family. \"In order to board the plane, Li Jie took febrifuge to lower her body temperature before boarding, and passed the body temperature checks,\" the district court verdict said. \"After boarding, when the flight required passengers to declare fever and other uncomfortable symptoms, Li Jie did not declare and did not truthfully answer the crew's inquiries about physical condition, contact history, and accompanying personnel.\" Before the plane landed, the woman admitted her real condition to the flight crew.  She and her family landed in Beijing on March 13 and she was immediately sent to the hospital for treatment, where she was diagnosed with Covid-19. She and 63 of her close contacts were quarantined, the court added. Beijing police later launched a criminal investigation and Shunyi District Court ordered a one-year suspended sentence Tuesday for \"the crime of obstructing the prevention and control of infectious diseases.\" The UK is set to make an announcement later Tuesday regarding the use of hotel quarantine, according to vaccine minister Nadhim Zahawi. Travel to and from the UK has been largely limited since the country suspended its travel corridors on January 18. British media reports the UK government might impose a hotel quarantine on travelers coming from certain countries with known new variants. Zahawi called hotel quarantine measures \"the right thing to do\" as the UK \"vaccinates more of our population.\" He warned that the country needs \"to be very careful\" about imports of the Brazilian and South African variant. Zahawi also addressed UK vacationers, saying it was \"far too early\" to \"even speculate about the summer,\" adding that \"there's still 37,000 people in hospital with Covid at the moment.\" Some background: British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Monday the idea of using hotels for UK arrivals for 10 days was “definitely” being “looked at.” Speaking from a vaccination center in London, Johnson said: “We want to make sure that we protect our population, protect this country against reinfection from abroad. That idea of looking at hotels is certainly one thing we're actively now working on.”  “We have to realize there is at least the theoretical risk of a new variant that is a vaccine-busting variant coming in, we've got to be able to keep that under control,” he added. Quarantine hotels have been used as a pandemic control measure in several countries, including Australia. The UK reported 22,195 new Covid-19 infections and 592 new deaths within 28 days of a positive test on Monday. The total number of people in the UK who have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test stands at 98,531, the highest death toll in Europe. According to government data, 6,573,570 people have received the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, whilst 470,478 people have received the second dose. ##Restrictions## ##Variants## ##Hotspots## More than 9% of people in the US state of West Virginia have received at least their first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, according to data published Monday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Nationally, that number stands at less than 6%. \"We continue to lead the nation,\" Gov. Jim Justice said in a news conference Monday. The governor's announcement comes amid continued struggles with vaccine rollouts across the US. States are still working to ramp up their administrations with the help of mass vaccination sites and volunteer vaccinators, while others say they're running out of supply and have appealed to the federal government for more doses. West Virginia is second in the nation in terms of vaccines administered per capita and share of distributed doses that have been administered, according to CDC data, and has often led the nation in these metrics. The state has so far administered about 106% of the doses it has officially received, Justice said. Read the full story here: Police in the Netherlands arrested 184 rioters nationwide on Monday night, according to the country's national broadcaster NOS. Some of the fiercest clashes with police were in Rotterdam, where officers said 50 arrests were made. Police said in a statement Tuesday that a group of youths started gathering in south Rotterdam around 7:30 p.m. on Monday, and eventually totaled several hundred. “Agents were bombarded with stones and fireworks, and the rioters were also destructive, looting various stores and committing arson,” according to police. Riot police deployed a water cannon, tear gas, and at one point an agent fired a “warning shot” after being “cornered by a number of rioters.” It was the third night of confrontation with police in the Netherlands. A national, nightly curfew designed to reduce social contact came into effect in the country on Saturday. It runs from 9 p.m. to 4:30 a.m. Several cities -- included Eindhoven, Nijmegen, and Roosendaal -- had instituted emergency orders on Monday to prevent people from entering city centers. The rules meant that no one was allowed to be in central areas between 5 p.m. and 4:30 a.m. without a legitimate reason. Ahead of Monday's demonstrations, Eindhoven municipality had tweeted a warning to residents that the city center had been declared \"a safety risk area\" and that police were \"prepared and strict.\" National police said earlier Monday that at least 250 were arrested at sometimes violent anti-lockdown protests on Sunday. Police had also used water cannon, dogs and riot police on horseback to disperse the protesters at those incidents. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte on Monday condemned the violence of anti-lockdown demonstrators over the weekend, calling their behavior “unacceptable.” \"Any normal person can only see this with horror. What are these people thinking?” Rutte said, as quoted by the Dutch public broadcaster NOS.  Rutte added that 99% of people in the country are sticking to the curfew. ##Restrictions## German Health Minister Jens Spahn is throwing his support behind a possible export limit for vaccines manufactured within the European Union amid a growing row with AstraZeneca over a shortfall in supply to the bloc.  The EU was informed by AstraZeneca last week that vaccine deliveries to member states -- pending authorization -- would not arrive before the end of the first quarter of 2021, as originally forecast. Spahn, speaking on German public broadcaster ZDF, said: “I can understand if during a complex production issue, there are production problems, but then everyone has to be affected fair and equal.\" He continued that his position was not about putting the \"EU first\" but about making sure that Europe is getting its fair share.  \"In my view [it] makes sense that we have an export limit, meaning that vaccines which leave the European Union, have a license so that we know what is being produced, what is leaving Europe, where it is leaving so that there is a fair distribution.” Separately, European Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides called for greater transparency regarding vaccine export from the European Union.  “We want clarity on transactions and full transparency concerning the export of vaccines from the EU,\" she tweeted late Monday. \"In the future, all companies producing vaccines against covid-19 in the EU will have to provide early notification whenever they want to export vaccines to third countries. Humanitarian deliveries are of course not affected by this.\" Earlier on Monday, Kyriakides said the pharmaceutical giant’s delays were “not acceptable.”  “The European Union has pre-financed the development of the vaccine and its production and wants to see the return,” she also said, adding that the bloc wants to know how many doses the company has produced, and who they’ve been sold to.  The AstraZeneca vaccine -- which has already been approved for emergency use by a number of countries including the UK and Brazil -- has been under review by the European Medicines Agency since January 12. The bloc has already fast-tracked the reviews for the Pfizer/BioNTech shot as well as the Moderna vaccine and both have been authorized for use. ##Vaccines## Addressing the world's economic elite in Davos on Monday, Chinese President Xi Jinping said that \"containing the coronavirus is the most pressing task for the international community.\" In a speech to the World Economic Forum, Xi called for \"closer solidarity and cooperation, more information sharing, and a stronger global response,\" as well as \"international cooperation on Covid vaccines.\" China has been praised for its \"vaccine diplomacy,\" promising shots to developing countries and investing in vaccine candidates that do not require expensive cold storage to be effective. But as questions have been raised over the effectiveness of one of those vaccines, the country's state media has reacted aggressively, targeting not just critics but also other vaccines, in an apparent effort to tear down their reputation in the name of defending the Chinese shots. Along with hyping reports of deaths allegedly related to vaccines -- a dangerous game that could undermine not only confidence in the Pfizer and Moderna candidates targeted by Chinese media, but all coronavirus shots -- China's propaganda organs have also pushed alternate theories about the origins of the pandemic itself, including a long-debunked claim that it began in a US army lab. \"If the United States truly respects facts, it should open the biological lab at Fort Detrick (and) give more transparency to issues like its 200-plus overseas bio-labs,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said last week, adding that the US should invite World Health Organization (WHO) investigators \"to conduct origin-tracing\" as they are in China. The leading US military germ lab, Fort Detrick briefly became a trending topic on Chinese social media after Hua's comments, which were heavily promoted online by the Communist Youth League, among other Party and state-backed accounts. Previously, Chinese officials have suggested -- without evidence -- that even if the pandemic did originate in Wuhan, the coronavirus could have been brought to the city by US soldiers taking part in the Military World Games in October 2019. Beijing has also pushed the idea that the virus could have entered the country on frozen food or other goods, despite most outside researchers disputing claims that it could be easily spread this way. Read the full analysis: ##Vaccines## New Zealand is likely to keep its borders closed to visitors through the rest of the year, the country’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said in a news conference Tuesday. Ardern said that in order for borders to reopen there needs to be confidence that vaccination prevents coronavirus spread or that enough of the population is vaccinated in the country. Ardern said that New Zealand would continue to seek travel bubbles with Australia and Pacific island nations but \"the rest of the world simply poses too big a risk to our health and our economy to take the risk at this stage.\" Speaking about the travel bubble with Australia, Ardern said she expressed \"disappointment\" to Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison over Monday’s decision to halt the program. She said if New Zealand enters into these travel bubbles, they need to be able to give residents confidence that borders will not be shut on short notice \"when it may not be necessary.\" Vaccines: New Zealand is hoping to start a mass vaccination program for the general population from \"mid year\" and the country’s medical regulation agency could give provisional approval for the Pfizer vaccine as soon as Wednesday, Ardern said. ##Restrictions## ##Vaccines## Around the world, the vaccine rollout has shone a harsh light on global income disparities. Rich countries take the lion's share of inoculations, and poorer states scramble to have even the prospect of life after coronavirus. The Middle East is a microcosm of that global problem. While oil-rich Gulf Arab nations were among the first in the world to receive a vaccine, war-torn countries such as Yemen and Syria must contend with vague timelines and complex distribution plans for the rollout, despite being among the worst affected by the virus. Gulf nations lead the way: The first Arab countries to begin vaccinating their citizens and residents were also the richest: Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain and Oman. The UAE stands out. The country of almost 10 million, which has one of the highest GDPs per capita in the world, also has one of the highest vaccination rates globally. More than 2 million residents and citizens have already been vaccinated using the Pfizer/BioNTech shot and China's Sinopharm vaccine. The Gulf state has already vaccinated more people than middle-income Jordan plans to inoculate in the first phase of its roll out. Lebanon, currently in the throes of a financial meltdown, has not yet had any vaccines delivered. Conflict zones: Syria, already on its knees after almost a decade of civil war, is facing an economic crisis. The country's president, Bashar al-Assad, does not control all of its territory. The government in Damascus will rely on GAVI, the vaccine alliance that co-leads COVAX. Opposition groups in Syria's largely Kurdish northeast, and rebel-controlled northwest will do the same. In war-torn Yemen, suffering a devastating humanitarian crisis, rival governments in the country's south and north appear to have only a vague notion of what the vaccine rollout will look like. In Israel and the Palestinian territories, region-wide vaccine disparities also come into sharp focus. Israel's world-leading vaccination campaign, which is on course to meet the government's target of inoculating the entire country by the end of March, leaves at least 4.5 million Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza behind.

Police do not know the identity of the man who was sprayed and have so far received no complaints, they said. When asked about the rumored incident during a news conference Monday, Wheeler said, \"I can tell you there was an incident, I filed a police report, and that's all I can tell you right now.\" The mayor's office told CNN Monday evening that Wheeler does not have any further comment to make. Read the full story: Five people were arrested Tuesday after an \"unauthorized\" Australia Day protest in Sydney that breached health restrictions put in place to avoid the spread of Covid-19, New South Wales police said in a statement. Australia's national day, observed January 26, regularly sees large protests around the country over concerns that the date inappropriately celebrates the mass dispossession of the country's Indigenous population. Police said they worked with organizers to separate the crowd Tuesday into groups of fewer than 500 people in an effort to minimize health risks. \"No issues arose at the protest and the crowd began to disperse just after 11am, before a large group attempted to commence a march in Hyde Park about 11.45am,\" the NSW police statement said.\n\"Police spoke with the organiser and the crowd, giving them a formal warning regarding a breach of public health regulations before the crowd eventually dispersed.\" Four of those arrested were involved in a scuffle in which a police officer was allegedly assaulted, according to police. A 27-year-old woman and a 28-year-old man would be charged with failure to follow Covid-19 directions from police, among other charges, police said. Two other men were each issued with a 1,000 Australian dollar ($770) penalty and released. One man who was not part of the gathering was charged with breach of the peace, the police statement added. In Melbourne, two men were also detained during Australia Day protests for breaching the peace but were released without charge a short time later. \"Police were pleased with the behaviour of those that attended,\" Melbourne police told CNN. Thailand reported 959 new coronavirus infections Tuesday -- its highest single-day total since the pandemic began, according to the kingdom's Center for Covid-19 Situation Administration (CCSA). Some 937 cases were local transmissions and 22 imported. The CCSA said 848 of the local transmissions are from a mass testing drive in Samut Sakhon province -- the origin of Thailand’s most recent wave, and the hardest hit province with a total of 6,394 cases. The majority of the infected individuals from the mass testing are migrant workers from the neighboring nation of Myanmar, who live in dormitories and shophouses.   Most of the newly infected are young workers and asymptomatic, CCSA spokesman Dr. Taweesilp Visanuyotin said during a news conference Tuesday. Thailand’s total number of Covid-19 infections now stand at 14,646, including 75 deaths. Japan confirmed 2,765 new coronavirus infections on Monday, falling below 3,000 new daily cases for the first time since December 28, according to the country’s Health Ministry. The country’s total number of cases now stands at 368,855, with the death toll rising by 74 Monday to 5,171. The number of patients in a serious condition across the country rose to 1,017, up 10 from the previous day. Tokyo reported 618 new Covid-19 cases from Monday, bringing the total number of infections in the capital to 94,508. There are 2,808 patients under medical care in hospital with 148 in serious condition in Tokyo. State of emergency: Japanese minister in charge of coronavirus response Yasutoshi Nishimura said at a parliamentary session on Tuesday that one criterion for lifting the state of emergency is for the number of new cases in Tokyo to fall below 500. However, the decision to lift it will require a more comprehensive assessment, including the availability of hospital beds.  ##Hotspots## ##Restrictions## The United States reported 147,254 new coronavirus infections and 1,758 virus-related fatalities on Monday, according to Johns Hopkins University data. According to JHU's tally, the nationwide totals now stand at 25,293,201 cases, including 420,972 deaths. The totals include cases from all 50 states, the District of Columbia and other US territories, as well as repatriated cases. Vaccine numbers: At least 41,418,325 vaccine doses have been distributed and at least 22,734,243 shots administered, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. CNN is tracking US cases here. ##Hotspots## Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard announced on Twitter Monday that his PCR test came back negative, one day after the country's President tested positive for the novel coronavirus.   Ebrard's statement said he'll be tested again on Wednesday \"as recommended\", and will continue to work from home in the meantime. \"Tomorrow I will participate in the UN Security Council to present Mexico's position on the Middle East,\" his statement said. President Andrés Manuel López Obrador tested positive for Covid-19 on Sunday. On Friday, the two were seen sitting together unmasked with two other colleagues during a phone call with US President Joe Biden.  Lopez Obrador, who is rarely seen wearing a mask, has been working from the Presidential Palace as he recovers.  Mexico’s total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases stands at 1,771,740, with more than 150,000 deaths from the virus, according to the country’s Health Ministry.  ##Hotspots## People are more likely to contract Covid-19 through everyday activities now that virus variants are circulating in the United States, Dr. Leana Wen, emergency physician and CNN analyst said Monday. Wen told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that public health officials are extremely concerned about the variants emerging across the US. “We've seen what happens in other countries that have actually had coronavirus under relatively good control, then these variants took over and they had explosive spread of the virus, and then overwhelmed hospitals,” she said. Though public health measures, like masking and social distancing, will still help prevent the spread of the virus, low-risk activities might be more dangerous under these new conditions, said Wen. “Now we think that maybe it's safe to open K-8 schools,” she said. “Well, what happens if we have an even more transmissible variant that could make those activities a lot more dangerous?” “If we thought that going to the grocery store before was relatively safe, there's actually a higher likelihood of contracting coronavirus through those everyday activities,” she added. Wen said the circulation of virus variants underscores the need to increase vaccinations and perform more genomic surveillance. ##Variants## Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading infectious disease expert, said Monday evening he was extremely worried by former President Donald Trump's dangerous April suggestion that ingesting disinfectant could possibly be used to treat Covid-19. \"I just said, 'Oh my goodness gracious.' I could just see what's going to happen,\" Fauci told CNN's Erin Burnett on \"Out Front\" of Trump's suggestion. \"You're going to have people who hear that from the President and they're going to start doing dangerous and foolish things, which is the reason why, immediately, those of us who were not there said, 'This is something you should not do.' Be very explicit. The (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) came out, I think, the next day and put in one of their publications, 'Do not do this.'\" At an April White House news conference, Trump had mused about whether disinfectants could be used to treat the virus in humans -- asking whether there is \"a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning.\" He later falsely claimed he was being sarcastic and that he was prompting officials to look into the effect of disinfectant on hands -- not through ingestion or injection. But the comments prompted cleaning product companies and state health officials to issue warnings about the dangers of their ingestion. Read the full story: An influential model that is forecasting 569,000 Americans will die from Covid-19 by May 1 does not take into account new variants of the virus that are potentially more contagious, the scientist leading the modeling team said Monday. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington released a new forecast Sunday that also predicts a third wave of infection late this year unless people get more eager about the vaccine. But the model also sees cases and deaths tapering off starting in March and April. “These numbers don’t yet account for the new variants. We will be putting out models at the end of the week that will, and that will change the picture,” IHME director Dr. Christopher Murray told CNN’s Anderson Cooper.\n“But the decline that we expect to see is coming because we're at the peak of seasonality,” Murray said.\n“That's going to start driving down transmission, and we're seeing vaccination scale up, so … we expect to start coming off the peak in the coming weeks.”\nVaccines will make a real difference, Murray predicted. “I think the vaccine will prevent a lot of death,” he said. “But it's pretty likely we believe that there will be a third wave of transmission in the winter of 2021.” Vaccine uptake: The prediction of a third wave is not because of more transmissible new variants, but because people may not get vaccinated in the numbers needed, Murray said. “Well, it's about half say no -- a quarter are not sure, and a quarter say no,” he said. “So, it's the quarter not sure that we've got to focus on and convince them that the vaccine is really important for them and important for their family or for the community.” Half of Americans say they do plan to be vaccinated. ##Variants## ##Vaccines## The Biden administration's official goal still remains 100 million vaccine shots in their first 100 days in office, despite the US President expressing optimism that the total number could be even higher, a White House official told CNN.  President Joe Biden said that he was hopeful that the United States could soon be administering 1.5 million coronavirus vaccines a day -- 50% more than the 1 million doses per day goal he had been promising since before inauguration. But the White House is still aiming for the original goal, which the administration still views as “ambitious but achievable,” the official said. However they also anticipate that plenty of things could go wrong given the unprecedented nature of the pandemic.  The official stressed that the hope now was to surpass that original goal of 100 million vaccine shots in the first 100 days.  Describing Biden as an “optimist,” the official also said the President has been pushing his Covid team to aim for progress beyond their initial goal of 100 million vaccines doses in 100 days. ##Vaccines## About 0.01% of a large group of people who received two doses of Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine tested positive for coronavirus after their second shot -- and those patients had only a mild illness, according to preliminary data from an Israeli health care system.  Maccabi Healthcare Services found that out of approximately 128,600 people who received two doses of the vaccine, 20 became infected and tested positive more than a week after their second dose. Maccabi did not test all patients after receiving their second dose. Instead, they tested an unspecified number of people who developed symptoms or who were exposed to someone with Covid-19.   The clinical trials for Pfizer/BioNTech’s vaccine showed it to be about 95% effective.  The press release stated that the data is “preliminary” but that “the numbers are very encouraging.”  Of the 20 patients who tested positive, 50% suffer from chronic illnesses. All of the 20 patients experienced a mild illness with symptoms including headaches, cough, weakness or fatigue. No one was hospitalized.  Out of a population of just over 9 million people, Israel has given first vaccine doses to about 2.5 million people, and second doses to about 1 million people. ##Vaccines## If all has gone well with its clinical trial, Johnson & Johnson's Covid-19 vaccine will likely be the next one available in the United States. Last week, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci said that Johnson & Johnson is \"right around the corner\" from seeking emergency use authorization for its Covid-19 vaccine from the US Food and Drug Administration. The company said it's on track to have interim data from its clinical trial by the end of January. The company has a shareholder call on its fourth-quarter results Tuesday. Still, it can take weeks for the vaccine to make it through the US Food and Drug Administration's authorization process and it's not clear yet when any of those key steps will take place. The two vaccines already available in the United States are highly effective, but all eyes are on Johnson & Johnson's, which is only a single dose and would be much easier to administer. \"If this vaccine proves to be safe and effective, it could have major implications for the vaccine rollout because J&J has committed to producing and deploying at least a billion doses of vaccine during this calendar year, including at least 100 million doses for the U.S. population,\" said Dr. Dan Barouch of Harvard Medical School, who helped develop Johnson & Johnson's vaccine candidate. \"If it's a single-dose vaccine, then a billion vaccine doses would translate into a billion people vaccinated,\" Barouch said Monday on CNN's Coronavirus Fact vs Fiction podcast. Read the full story: ##Vaccines## The Moderna Covid-19 vaccine created antibodies that neutralized coronavirus variants first found in the United Kingdom and South Africa, the company said in a news release on Monday. But there are concerns that the vaccine may have a somewhat decreased efficacy against the strain first spotted in South Africa, and Moderna is working on a booster aimed at fighting it. Two doses of the vaccine are \"expected to be protective against emerging strains detected to date,\" according to the release.\nThe company's study showed that the variant first found in the UK had \"no significant impact\" on the vaccine's effectiveness.\nBut in the press release, Moderna noted that \"a six-fold reduction in neutralizing titers was observed with (the variant discovered in South Africa) relative to prior variants.\" The company said the vaccine was still expected to be effective. \"Despite this reduction, neutralizing titer levels with (the variant discovered in South Africa) remain above levels that are expected to be protective,\" according to the press release. David Montefiori, a virologist at Duke University Medical Center, said while he's \"cautiously optimistic\" Moderna's vaccine will work well against this strain, he's still not sure. \"The efficacy might be reduced somewhat, but it may still be very effective,\" he said. \"Hopefully the vaccine will still be 70-80% effective.\" The variant first identified in the UK has appeared in more than 45 other countries, including 195 cases in the US. The variant first identified in South Africa has appeared in more than 20 other countries. No cases have been identified in the US, but experts say it's likely there are cases and US surveillance, which has been widely criticized, has not yet found them. Read the full story: ##Vaccines## ##Variants## President Joe Biden said Monday that he expects the US will soon be able to vaccinate 1.5 million people a day, raising the bar by roughly 500,000 more vaccinations than its target of 1 million per day in his first 100 days in office. He said that the US could surpass that initial target in about three weeks. \"I'm quite confident that we will be in a position within the next three weeks or so to be vaccinating people at the range of 1 million a day or in excess of that,\" he told reporters, clarifying that he was referring to 100 million shots, not necessarily 100 million people, since some of the vaccines require more than one shot. Biden said the key factors in ramping up vaccinations are having enough vaccine, having enough syringes and other necessary equipment and having enough people administering them. He said his administration is working to produce additional vaccinators -- people who can administer the vaccine. \"I think with the grace of God, the goodwill of the neighbor and the creek not rising, as the old saying goes, I think we may be able to get that to 1.5 million a day, rather than 1 million a day,\" he said.
