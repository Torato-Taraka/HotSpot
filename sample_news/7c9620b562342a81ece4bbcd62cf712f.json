Besides the Sinovac vaccines, it would also use AstraZeneca vaccines.As of Wednesday, the Southeast Asian nation’s total COVID-19 tally rose to 25,692, with more than four-fifths of the infections being detected since the new wave of outbreak erupted in the country in mid-December.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "URL": "https://mb.com.ph/2021/02/26/thailand-receives-1st-batch-of-covid-19-vaccines-from-chinas-sinovac/", "MainKeyWord": "China", "AdditionalKeyWord": "Thailand", "Source": "MB"}
