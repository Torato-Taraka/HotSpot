It must also be fair trade,” he said.Li said that he hoped the two countries would be able to achieve “balance” in their trade relations.Financial woesDuring his nine-year rule, Najib was accused of cutting quick deals with Beijing in return for help paying off debts linked to a massive financial scandal that ultimately helped bring down his long-ruling coalition.Last week, Mahathir had said he would try to cancel or modify the previous administration’s agreements with China, stressing that “the most important thing is for us to save money”.As well as the rail link, which would have run from the Thai border to Kuala Lumpur, the government has suspended a China-backed project to build pipelines after alleging that almost all the money for the work was paid out but only a fraction of the project had been completed.Mahathir is trying to reduce Malaysia’s national debt, which has ballooned to some $250 billion.Despite the threat to revise China-linked contracts, Mahathir is seeking to strengthen business ties with Beijing during the trip.He met the founder of e-commerce giant Alibaba, Jack Ma, in the eastern city of Hangzhou on Saturday. Mahathir also oversaw the signing of a cooperation agreement between Chinese auto firm Geely and troubled Malaysian carmaker Proton.Geely in May took a 49.9 percent stake in Proton.China is the top trading partner of Malaysia, which is home to a substantial ethnic Chinese minority.Relations were warm under the previous government, and Chinese investment in the country surged as Beijing signed deals for major infrastructure and construction projects.But critics said there was often a lack of transparency and the terms, such as interest rates on loans, were unfavorable to Malaysia, fuelling suspicions about Najib’s real motives.Najib and his cronies are accused of plundering billions of dollars from a sovereign wealth fund, 1MDB, in an audacious fraud.Since losing power, Najib has been charged over the scandal and will stand trial. He denies any wrongdoing.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "URL": "https://mb.com.ph/2018/08/20/malaysia-pm-calls-for-chinas-help-with-fiscal-problems/", "MainKeyWord": "China", "AdditionalKeyWord": "Malaysia", "Source": "MB"}
