This is in addition to the buses deployed under the MRT-3 Bus Augmentation Program. No fare increase shall be implemented,” the DOTr emphasized.Through the interim operations, buses from Monumento to Quezon Avenue will be using the following bus stops located on the curbside for the meantime to pick-up and/or drop off passengers:Retaining the existing set-up, buses will shift using the median lanes with the partial operability of the busway section from Quezon Avenue to Estrella.Upon exiting Estrella, the DOTr said bus units will be allowed to pick-up and/or unload passengers at the following curbside stops from Buendia to the PITX:“Buses will be using these curbside stops until the needed bus stops, including lighting, fences, and canopies, are completed, and when the concrete barriers are placed on EDSA’s median lanes,” the Department added.The DOTr mentioned that it has already procured 36,000 concrete barriers for the busway. Partial delivery of the barriers will begin Thursday until next week and are expected to be completed by August or September this year, it said.The EDSA Busway also aims to significantly cut travel time from Monumento to Parañaque Integrated Terminal Exchange (PITX) from the usual 2 to 3 hours because of traffic, to just 45 minutes to 1 hour, the DOTr said.Meanwhile, to ferry more essential commuters amid the general community quarantine (GCQ), the LTFRB said it will be implementing a mini loop from Timog Avenue to Santolan beginning Thursday.“The Timog to Santolan mini loop will be serviced by shuttles or mini buses, and shall be allowed to pick up and drop off passengers at designated curbside stops,” the agency announced.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "URL": "https://mb.com.ph/2020/07/01/edsa-busway-operations-begin-150-buses-deployed/", "MainKeyWord": "Hong Kong", "AdditionalKeyWord": "Thailand", "Source": "MB"}
