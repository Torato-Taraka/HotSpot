Fiery Cross Reef is a man-made island controlled by China and built on a disputed South China Sea reef. Vietnam and the Philippines have competing claims on the reef.“It’s very likely that China will send an oil rig to drill in the area where the Haiyang Dizhi 8 had conducted seismic surveys in Vietnam’s exclusive economic zone,” Hop said.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "URL": "https://mb.com.ph/2019/10/24/chinese-ship-leaves-vietnams-waters-after-disputed-south-china-sea-surveys/", "MainKeyWord": "China", "AdditionalKeyWord": "viet Nam", "Source": "MB"}
