The official did not want to be named.Each of the new units sold in the project neighboring Singapore is priced above 1 million ringgit ($239,578), agent Lee said.Reuters reported this week that a Malaysian program to attract foreigners to live in the country had drawn 251 applications from Hong Kong residents this year, compared with 193 approved last year from the Chinese-ruled city.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "URL": "https://mb.com.ph/2019/08/21/spooked-by-protests-hong-kong-citizens-buy-malaysian-homes/", "MainKeyWord": "Hong Kong", "AdditionalKeyWord": "Malaysia", "Source": "MB"}
