It is located around 480 km west of Puerto Princesa, Palawan.The other features include Likas Island which is known internationally as (West York); Parola Cay (Northeast); Lawak Island (Nanshan); Kota Island (Loaita); Patag Island (Flat); Panata Cay (Lankiam); Rizal Reef (Commodore); and Ayungin Shoal (Second Thomas).The WPS is an area in the South China Sea that is within the 200-nautical mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the Philippines.Aside from the Philippines, other countries which have overlapping claims in the heavily-disputed South China Sea include China, Vietnam, Taiwan, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Brunei.In 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration in Hague, The Netherlands ruled in favor of the Philippines in its claims in the WPS against China.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "URL": "https://mb.com.ph/2020/06/10/ph-to-build-more-cellular-sites-on-pagasa-island-after-officials-receive-welcome-text-messages-from-china-vietnam/", "MainKeyWord": "China", "AdditionalKeyWord": "viet Nam", "Source": "MB"}
