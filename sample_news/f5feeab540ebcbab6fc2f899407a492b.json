One of the cut scenes featured a designer bag with a map of the world showing disputed South China Sea islands under Beijing’s control.This year’s hit “Joker”, starring Joaquin Phoenix, was also trimmed to exclude a scene of supporters rallying around the DC Comics villain — possibly to avoid any suggestion of a popular uprising or personality cult.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "URL": "https://mb.com.ph/2019/10/14/animated-film-abominable-pulled-in-vietnam-over-south-china-sea-map/", "MainKeyWord": "China", "AdditionalKeyWord": "viet Nam", "Source": "MB"}
