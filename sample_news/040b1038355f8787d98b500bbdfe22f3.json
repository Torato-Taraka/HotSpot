{"Type": "article", "Time": "2020-06-16", "Headline": "June 17 coronavirus news", "Text": "Our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic has ended for the evening. Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey resisted broad calls from physicians across his state to implement a statewide mandate for wearing masks in public places.  Instead, Ducey said Wednesday he would leave that decision to mayors in his state because some areas, specifically rural regions, have different levels of transmission. Ducey added some local leaders are unlikely to follow an executive order on that matter and if that were the case, \"it's a self-defeating executive order.\"  The governor also announced that he would be calling up 300 National Guard members to help with Covid-19 contact tracing in the state. During a virtual news conference, Ducey did not provide any date for the deployment but called the increased National Guard presence “a surge” to cope with the increase in state cases. Some context: Ducey’s announcement comes as cases of Covid-19 in Arizona continue to spike with a total number of cases climbing to 40,924.       The mayor of Houston, Texas, Sylvester Turner, said Wednesday that he is considering implementing a face mask order. “You maybe bored of the virus, but the virus is not bored of you,” Turner said. The Houston Health Department is reporting at least 10,507 positive cases of coronavirus and approximately 169 deaths since the pandemic began, Turner said. The mayor said the Greater Houston partnership, which is a coalition of Houston-area business owners, supports the idea of a mask order that would require employees and customers to wear face masks. Turner said he spoke briefly to Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo today about the possibility of an order, but said he doesn't anticipate any moves to happen immediately. He added that even if a face mask order was issued, he would not require jail time for violators. \"We want people to be able to go back to school for example in the fall and to engage in other activities and functions during the fall. But in order for that to happen, how we handle the summer is going to be critically important,\" he said. Dr. David Persse with the Houston Health Department said he is concerned with the recent uptick in emergency room visits in Houston.  Both Dr. Persse and Turner believe the recent uptick is due to younger people going to clubs and restaurants. A team of European scientists say they have found two genetic variations that may show who is more likely to get very sick and die from coronavirus, and say they have also found a link with blood type. Their findings, published Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine, point to a possible explanation of why some people get so seriously ill with the virus, while most barely show any symptoms at all. They found people with Type A blood have a higher risk of catching coronavirus and of developing severe symptoms, while people with Type O blood have a lower risk. “Our genetic data confirm that blood group O is associated with a risk of acquiring Covid-19 that was lower than that in non-O blood groups, whereas blood group A was associated with a higher risk than non-A blood groups,” the researchers wrote in their report.  They found people with Type A blood had a 45% higher risk of becoming infected than people with other blood types, and people with Type O blood were just 65% as likely to become infected as people with other blood types. The researchers cannot say if blood type is a direct cause of the differences in susceptibility. It might be that the genetic changes that affect someone’s risk also just happen to be linked with blood type, they said. The two genetic variations they found could be associated with a person’s immune response. A so-called cytokine storm – an overwhelming overreaction of the immune system – is blamed for the deadliest effect of coronavirus in many patients.   Peru surpassed Italy's number of confirmed Covid-19 cases Wednesday, making it the country with the seventh highest number of cases worldwide, according to a tally from Johns Hopkins University. As of Wednesday evening, Peru topped 240,908 confirmed cases, the country's health ministry reported, adding that its death toll from the virus is 7,257. Italy stands at 237,828 cases, Johns Hopkins reported.  Some background: Peru was one of the first Latin American countries to shut down its borders amid the outbreak, while Italy was once one of the countries hardest hit by the virus, having the most coronavirus-related deaths of any country in the world for months. Peru is now just behind Spain in the total number of confirmed cases, according to Johns Hopkins. ##Cases## Brazil's health ministry on Wednesday reported 32,188 new cases of Covid-19, bringing the country's total to 955,377.  The ministry also confirmed 1,269 new deaths from the virus, bringing the total to 46,510. Brazil holds the second highest number of both confirmed cases and deaths from the virus, behind the United States. Brazilian health authorities said on Monday they will now recommend hydroxychloroquine to treat children and pregnant women for early treatment of Covid-19, and criticized the US Food and Drug Administration's recent decision to revoke the emergency use of the drug. ##Cases## West Virginia has a sixth church-related Covid-19 outbreak in the state, three of which are still active, Gov. Jim Justice announced Wednesday afternoon. At least 32 positive coronavirus cases have been identified at one church in Greenbrier County and four cases at a church in Ohio County. Justice did not share details on how many parishioners had the virus at the Boone County church, the third active outbreak location. “The reality is really simple: when we don’t adhere to the guidelines, as far as wearing masks, participating in social distancing, and sitting in every other pew, we’re asking for trouble,” Justice said in a statement. \"We’ve got to all know that, while church is the most holy and sacred ground, it is the spot where we’re singing, we’re projecting our voices, we’re closer together, and all the things that make it ripe for an outbreak or a potential problem.” ##Cases## The US Food and Drug Administration sent warning letters to three companies selling Covid-19 tests that the FDA says were “inappropriately” marketed and “potentially placing public health at risk.”  This is the first time the agency says it has sent warning letters to companies for marketing adulterated or misbranded test kits.  The letters went to Medakit Ltd. of Sheung Wan, Hong Kong; Antibodiescheck.com and Yama Group; and Dr. Jason Korkus, DDS and Sonrisa Family Dental d/b/a My COVID19 Club of Chicago, Illinois. The agency asked these companies to take immediate steps to fix violations and stop the sale of the products. The FDA said the companies violated policy by offering at-home test kits in the US for sale without getting marketing approval or authorization. Products were misbranded as “FDA approved,” when they weren’t, and the products used the FDA logo which is only supposed to be used by the FDA and not used by the private sector, the agency said. The FDA said that if the companies don’t take immediate action, the agency may take legal action that could include seizing the product. There is no home diagnostic or antibody test for Covid-19 authorized by the FDA. Home tests pose certain challenges for the public that may not be able to collect samples and interpret the results as well as a trained professional could. There are some FDA approved self diagnostic tests for people to use at home, but those require users to send those samples to a lab for processing. Los Angeles recorded 2,175 new coronavirus cases in the county, another single day high.  As in past reports, Health Director Barbara Ferrer attributed the spike to lagging test reports. The daily case count is hard to interpret, Ferrer said, and indicated that the key metric for the county is hospitalization rates, which are steady at about 1,300 patients. The average daily death rate is steadily decreasing and has gone from about 45 fatalities each day in early May to about 35 deaths now, Ferrer said. The rate in Los Angeles remains at about 8%. While much of California continues to reopen business sectors, Los Angeles is lagging behind somewhat in a continued effort to mitigate new cases. It is unclear if any of the cases might be linked to recent protests, but contact tracing efforts are continuing, Ferrer said. ##Cases## The nation’s top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said he personally would not attend President Trump’s upcoming campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Saturday. “No,” he answered when asked whether he would attend the event during an interview Tuesday with the Daily Beast. “I'm in a high risk category. Personally, I would not. Of course not,” said Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. When pressed about Trump’s planned rallies amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, Fauci told the Daily Beast that “outside is better than inside, no crowd is better than crowd” and “crowd is better than big crowd.” Those attending the rally are not required to wear masks, and social distancing measures will be next to impossible in the arena setting. This as Tulsa announced its highest daily number of coronavirus infections Wednesday, and cases are rising across the state. Fauci warned in a CNN interview Friday that there’s a risk of either “acquiring or spreading” the deadly coronavirus for those who attend the rally. “When you are in a large crowd, if you have the congregation of people that are much, much close to each other, you definitely increase the risk that you will either acquire or spread infections,” he told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer. Fauci said people are going to gather, despite the warnings. “But the issue is, if they do, please wear a mask, all the time, because the mask will give you some protection. The best thing to do is to avoid crowded areas, but if you're not going to do that, please wear a mask.” The company that makes the antiviral drug remdesivir, used to treat coronavirus, says it is about to start advanced trials of the drug in children.  Gilead Sciences said it was starting a phase 2/3 trial in 50 pediatric patients with moderate to severe Covid-19 who are in the hospital. These trials are meant to assess safety and efficacy. Children from babies on up will be eligible for the trial, being run at 30 sites in the US and Europe.  Remdesivir, which is infused, is the only drug that has US Food and Drug Administration emergency authorization for use in treating coronavirus infections. Gilead has treated pediatric patients with remdesivir since February under compassionate use program. “From the onset of the pandemic, Gilead has advanced the development of our investigational antiviral remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19, in parallel with emerging knowledge about the disease. While the novel coronavirus appears to disproportionally affect adults – especially the elderly and those with underlying health conditions – concerning reports have been documented of children and young adults being hospitalized with COVID-19 and related autoimmune symptoms,” the company said in a statement.  A recent study funded by Gilead found that moderately ill Covid-19 patients who received a five-day course of remdesivir were more likely to have clinical improvement after 11 days compared to those who received traditional standard of care alone, according to the company.  ##The Future## After the Kentucky Board of Elections asked Gov. Andy Beshear to help provide personal protective equipment (PPE) for the primary elections next Tuesday, the governor announced today that his administration will provide the equipment to keep voters and poll workers safe during the election. The state will provide 5,000 masks, 4,000 gallons of hand sanitizer, 5,800 face shields and 20,000 gloves for the June 23 election, and the PPE will be distributed to all 120 counties in Kentucky. “I encourage every Kentuckian to vote, which is their duty as an American, but we must take every precaution available to protect voters and poll workers exercising that fundamental right,” Beshear said. ���We continue to take action to allow people to safely exercise their right to vote on Tuesday, including ensuring our poll workers have this protective gear.” While there will be in-person voting on Tuesday, Kentuckians will also allowed to vote via absentee ballot due to Covid-19. Additionally, Beshear authorized plainclothes Kentucky National Guardsmen to assist at polling sites, where requested by county clerks. The federal government is stuck with 63 million doses of hydroxychloroquine now that the US Food and Drug Administration has revoked permission for the drug to be distributed to treat coronavirus patients.  The government started stockpiling hydroxychloroquine donated by pharmaceutical companies in late March, after President Trump touted it as “very encouraging” and “very powerful” and a “game-changer.”  But Monday, the FDA revoked its emergency use authorization to use the drug to treat Covid-19, saying there was “no reason to believe” the drug was effective against the virus, and that it “increased the risk of side effects, including heart problems.”   Before the FDA revoked its authorization, the stockpile had already distributed 31 million doses. That leaves the Strategic National Stockpile with 63 million doses of hydroxychloroquine, plus another 2 million doses of chloroquine, a related drug, according to Carol Danko, a spokesperson for the US Department of Health and Human Services.  “HHS is working with the companies that donated the product to determine the available options for the product that remains in the Strategic National Stockpile,” Danko wrote in a statement to CNN. US stocks finished mixed on Wednesday, with the Dow and the S&P 500 closing lower. Both indexes snapped a three-day winning streak. Momentum that had carried the stock rally over the past days faded on Thursday as the number of new Covid-19 infections rose in some areas. Here's where the markets closed: The Dow fell 0.7%, or 170 points\nThe S&P 500 ended down 0.4%.\nThe Nasdaq Composite was the only of the three main indexes to end the day higher, adding 0.2%. It was its fourth day of gains in a row. ##Economy## New York City has 17,487 confirmed coronavirus deaths and 4,684 probable coronavirus deaths as of June 17, according to the most recent data on the city's website. The New York City Health Department defines probable deaths as people who did not have a positive Covid-19 laboratory test, but their death certificate lists as the cause of death “Covid-19” or an equivalent. The total number of confirmed coronavirus deaths and probable coronavirus deaths in New York City is 22,171. There have been 207,821 coronavirus cases in the city and 54,170 people have been hospitalized, according to the city. The data is from the New York City Health Department and was updated on June 17 at 1:15 p.m., according to the website. ##Cases## North Carolina health officials reported that 846 patients are currently hospitalized with Covid-19 as of Wednesday, according to the state's Department of Health and Human Services. This marks the highest number of patients hospitalized since May 16; hospitalizations prior to that were not immediately available, according to the health department's website. The health department collected the hospitalization data from 86% of its hospitals, the website said. More data: North Carolina averaged about 1,240 new cases per day over the last week, an increase of about 20% from the previous seven-day period, CNN reported. There are currently 46,855 coronavirus cases in North Carolina, the health department said.  ##Cases##  It's almost 3 p.m. ET on the East Coast and noon on the West Coast. If you're just joining us, here are the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic in the US: Covid-19 cases increase in Tulsa ahead of rally: The number of coronavirus cases are increasing in Tulsa, Oklahoma, ahead of President Trump's campaign rally on Saturday. Ninety-six Tulsa residents tested positive for Covid-19 in the past day, according to Dr. Bruce Dart of the Tulsa Health Department. This is a new daily record for the county, Dart said. \nSchools allowed to resume in Michigan: Schools across Michigan will be allowed to resume in-person instruction this fall with strict safety measures in place, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer announced. The governor will release an executive order and the \"Michigan Return to School Roadmap\" on June 30 to outline details on what will be required and recommended for schools to reopen.\nNew York City to enter phase two of reopening: Phase two allows for a wider range of businesses to continue to reopen under Covid-19 guidelines, including retail businesses and offices, according to the state's reopening website. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has announced that once the city enters phase two, restaurants will be able to open for outdoor seating, and convert parking spaces into seating areas.\nNation's top infectious disease expert's advice for the MLB: Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said baseball season should not extend past October to avoid the risk of spreading Covid-19. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times on Tuesday, Fauci said Major League Baseball (MLB) should conclude the postseason in September over concerns of a second coronavirus wave in the fall.\nWHO ends portion of trial: The hydroxychloroquine arm of the World Health Organization’s Covid-19 Solidarity Trial will end based on a recommendation from the agency’s Data Safety and Monitoring Committee, according to a WHO official. The decision was made based on preliminary information from a separate hydroxychloroquine study in the United Kingdom that showed no benefit of the antimalarial against Covid-19, and early data from the Solidarity Trial itself, WHO said. ##Catch Up## Arizona health officials reported 1,827 new coronavirus cases and 20 new Covid-19-related deaths on Wednesday, according to the state Department of Health Services website.   Wednesday's case count marks the state's second highest total reported in a single day, behind yesterday's 2,392 cases, according to the health website.   There has been at least 40,924 cases of coronavirus in the state and at least 1,239 people have died from the virus, the health website said.     Texas has reached a somber record — 2,793 coronavirus patients are currently hospitalized, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services dashboard.   The current number of patients is a nearly 85% increase since Memorial Day, when 1,511 hospitalizations were reported.  State health officials report 13,815 available hospital beds in Texas.  ##Cases##  There are a few things parents should consider before expanding a family's social circle during the Covid-19 pandemic, including the prevalence of cases in their community, said a pediatrics professor at John Hopkins University School of Medicine. \"A lot of this is coming down to individual people's risk tolerance,\" Dr. Aaron Milstone said Wednesday during a virtual discussion hosted by JHU. Milstone said that if a child wants to socialize with other kids in the neighborhood, it's important for their parents to know the prevalence of the virus in their area. \"They have to think of it as cobweb or this network that has lots of tentacles, and if you bring in one new person, you're also bringing in all the people that those people are exposed to,\" Milstone said. He encouraged parents to have conversation with other parents about health safety to make sure their priorities align. Families should also continue practicing social distancing even when interacting with others, They should wear masks when gathering indoors, and continue to follow good hygiene practices. Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt is scheduled to visit the White House on Thursday, two sources familiar with the meeting tell CNN.  The governor's spokesperson described the meeting as a discussion on “how to continue to partner with the federal government to help Oklahoma’s economy and get small businesses back on their feet.” Oklahoma small business owners will also be in attendance, according to a White House official.  Some context: The meeting comes days ahead of President Trump's campaign rally in Tulsa on Saturday — his first large-scale event since the coronavirus pandemic brought American life to a standstill.  The director of the Tulsa Health Department said he wishes Trump would postpone the rally, citing concerns about a recent increase in local cases of Covid-19. But a judge on Tuesday denied an emergency motion to stop the rally. That lawsuit was filed on behalf of a series of community groups and two specific individuals, who the attorneys describe as particularly vulnerable to the spread of Covid-19.  White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany would not directly answer when asked if President Trump or the White House would take responsibility if attendees catch coronavirus during a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma set to be held Saturday.  McEnany got into an extended exchange with CNN’s Jim Acosta, but never responded directly to the question.  “The campaign has taken certain measures to make sure this is a safe rally, temperature checks, hand sanitizers, and masks,” McEnany said during a press briefing Wednesday. “We are taking precautions.  CNN reported that attendees of Trump's upcoming rally must agree not to sue the campaign if they contract coronavirus. Rallygoers are asked to RSVP to gain admission to the event and by registering, they must agree to a disclaimer that states they acknowledge the \"inherent risk of exposure to COVID-19 exists in any public place where people are present.\" Asked by Acosta if attendees would be required to wear masks, McEnany said they will not be required.   “They will be given a mask, it’s up to them whether to make that decision,” she said, adding that, “CDC guidelines are recommended, but not required,” and that it was a “personal choice of individuals.”  McEnany then accused the media of a lack of “internal coherence,” for not asking the same questions of the protesters who came out across the country after the death of George Floyd.  Acosta pointed out that they were marching against injustice, racism, and police brutality, not attending a political rally, and again asked if the President or White House would take responsibility if people get sick.  McEnany deflected, attacked health experts who came out in support of the protests, and reiterated that the campaign has taken “certain measures to make sure this is a safe rally.”  Asked later by another reporter if the White House position was that outdoor events and indoor events carry the same risk for coronavirus, McEnany said that it’s the White House position that “the media should not be making decisions about their guidelines to us about social distancing based on political ideology.”  The Secretary of Higher Education in New Jersey today released guidance for colleges and universities to reopen for in-person instruction for the upcoming summer and fall sessions.  Here's what's in the guidance:  Cleaning and social distancing: The guidance requires institutions to observe social distancing of six feet, hand washing, cleaning and disinfection, and must have procedures in place to accommodate individuals with symptoms or a positive Covid-19 diagnosis.\nMask wearing: Institutions must require face masks in all indoor spaces, except when doing so would be bad for an individual's health.  \nDorms: A limited number of students will be allowed to return to residential facilities, but institutions need to develop quarantine and isolation protocols for residents and all common areas in buildings must remain closed. Schools are also asked to prioritize on campus housing for the students for whom it’s most necessary. \nDining: Campus dining and campus transportation will be required to abide by the state-issued reopening guidelines. \nClasses: Institutions can have instruction that occurs completely outdoors as long as they are abiding by state-established restrictions. \nTesting: College and universities will be responsible for establishing their own testing protocols, working with local health officials.  “Colleges this fall and summer will not look the same as they did last year,” New Jersey Higher Education Secretary Dr. Zakiya Smith Ellis said Wednesday.    Schools must submit their restart plans to the office of the Secretary of Higher Education at least 14 days before any staff or students return to campus.  ##Reopening## Ninety-six Tulsa residents tested positive for Covid-19 in the past day, according to Dr. Bruce Dart of the Tulsa Health Department. This is a new daily record for the county, according to Dart. He said the number of cases reported are continuing to set new records.  There are 1,825 total positive cases in Tulsa County. At least 1,166 people have recovered and 64 residents have died. In a news conference, Dart also issued a warning ahead of President Trump's campaign rally in the city on Saturday saying that \"anyone planning to attend a large scale gathering will face an increased risk of becoming infected with Covid-19.\" The rally would be Trump's first major campaign event since the coronavirus pandemic shut down most of American life, and officials are expecting hundreds of thousands of supporters to attempt to attend.  Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt said in the news conference today that more than 1 million requests have been made to attend the rally.  There are at least 2,143,193 cases of coronavirus in the US, and at least 117,129 people have died, according to a tally from Johns Hopkins University. So far on Wednesday, Johns Hopkins reported 5,486 new cases and 167 deaths.   The totals include cases from all 50 states, the District of Columbia and other US territories, as well as repatriated cases.  ##Cases## Dr. Bruce Dart of the Tulsa Health Department issued a warning ahead of President Trump's campaign rally on Saturday: \"Anyone planning to attend a large scale gathering will face an increased risk of becoming infected with Covid-19.\" Dart said he shared the same concerns as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention regarding large in-person gatherings. The CDC warns that \"the more people an individual interacts with at a gathering and the longer that interaction lasts, the higher the potential risk of becoming infected with COVID-19 and COVID-19 spreading.\" He went on to say that he supports the right to assemble but asked those who are part of a vulnerable population to stay at home and to seek other ways to participate in the event virtually.  Dart also recommended that anyone attending the rally wear a mask covering correctly, covering your nose and mouth.    Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt said in a news conference today that more than 1 million requests have been made to attend President Trump's campaign rally in Tulsa on Saturday. Stitt will be at the White House on Thursday to meet with the President prior to the rally, he told reporters. “I haven’t decided if I’m going to wear a mask,” Stitt said when responding to a question regarding wearing a mask while at the White House.  He went on to say that he won’t wear one when he introduces the President at the rally. Stitt acknowledged that Covid-19 is in Oklahoma and they would have to learn how best to live with that. Some context: A judge on Tuesday denied an emergency motion to stop  Trump's campaign rally in Tulsa on Saturday. The decision came after local lawyers asked the court to block the event unless organizers agreed to take steps to adhere to the administration's own social distancing recommendations to limit the spread of coronavirus. Saturday's rally is still scheduled to take place at BOK Center, but the campaign is exploring an additional venue designed to work as an overflow location to help accommodate the overwhelming response of supporters hoping to see the President speak. During an interview on Fox News, Vice President Mike Pence suggested that the additional venue could be outdoors. Oklahoma is among at least 21 states that are seeing upward trends in newly reported cases from one week to the next.  Schools across Michigan will be allowed to resume in-person instruction this fall with strict safety measures in place, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer announced in a news conference Wednesday. Whitmer said the \"Return to Learn\" advisory council has been hard at work coming up with a safe plan to reopen schools.  The governor will release an executive order and the \"Michigan Return to School Roadmap\" on June 30 to outline details on what will be required and recommended for schools to reopen. The roadmap will set minimum health and safety requirements, Whitmer said, adding school districts may choose to enact more aggressive ones. The hydroxychloroquine arm of the World Health Organization’s Covid-19 Solidarity Trial will end based on a recommendation from the agency’s Data Safety and Monitoring Committee, according to a WHO official. Dr. Ana Maria Henao-Restrepo, a medical officer at WHO's Department of Immunization Vaccines and Biologicals, said during a media briefing in Geneva on Wednesday that the decision was made based on preliminary information from a separate hydroxychloroquine study in the United Kingdom that showed no benefit of the antimalarial against Covid-19, and early data from the Solidarity Trial itself.  \"Today, just five minutes ago, we finalized a call with all the investigators in the trial,\" Henao-Restrepo said during Wednesday's briefing.  \"A decision was made to stop the randomization with the hydroxychloroquine trial on the basis of two pieces of information. The first, the data that was published by the UK trial and second, the data that was available to us from the Solidarity Trial,\" Henao-Restrepo said, later clarifying in the briefing that \"they have concluded that the hydroxychloroquine arm will be stopped from the Solidarity Trial.\" In May, WHO temporarily paused the hydroxychloroquine arms of its Solidarity Trial due to concerns surrounding the safety of hydroxychloroquine and in order to review its own data. Then earlier this month, after that review, WHO announced that it would resume studying hydroxychloroquine as a potential Covid-19 treatment in the Solidarity Trial. Yet in the days following, a separate trial in the United Kingdom, called the Recovery Trial, announced plans to stop using hydroxychloroquine in its study due to \"no evidence of benefit,\" according to the researchers. That spurred WHO to conduct another review of the hydroxychloroquine arm in its Solidarity Trial, which led to this most recent decision to drop hydroxychloroquine from the trial. This latest announcement from WHO comes just days after the US Food and Drug Administration on Monday revoked its emergency use authorization for the drugs hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine for the treatment of Covid-19.  Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser announced today that the District will enter into phase two of reopening on Monday if the current trends in Covid-19 metrics continue.  “We are trending in the right direction,” Bowser told reporters at a press conference this morning. The mayor said she expects to be able to announce this Friday whether or not the District will be ready to enter phase two Monday. In phase two of reopening:  Gatherings of more than 50 people are still banned, nonessential retail can open at 50% capacity, and restaurants can have indoor dining at 50% capacity. \nHouses of worship are encouraged to hold virtual services, but are permitted to have up to 100 people, or 50% capacity. DC recommends that churches do not have choirs or singing. \nPersonal services, including nail care, tattooing and waxing will be permitted under phase 2 with certain restrictions in place.  Officials said three out of the four key metrics used to decide if DC is ready to move into phase 2 have been met, barring a spike in community spread cases of coronavirus over the coming days. The fourth metric is that the contact tracing force has a 90% success rate contacting positive cases within one day —that is yet to be met.  Director of DC Public Health LaQuandra Nesbitt explained that the government has a new digital system and has increased the number of contact tracers, which Bowser said “gives us confidence in saying that we are hitting, going to hit, where we need to be.” As of today, Washington, DC, has at least 9,847 positive community spread cases of the coronavirus, and 523 people have died from the virus. When asked if the District should wait to enter phase two until the effects of protests are clear on the spread of the coronavirus, Bowser said “we always have the ability to turn up or turn down our reopening.” “This virus is not gone, it is still here,” Bowser added. ##Reopening## The Oklahoma Department of Health has reported an additional 259 cases of Covid-19 since Tuesday.  The state now has at least 8,904 confirmed positive cases of coronavirus according to data from the state’s Department of Health. The jump represents a 3% increase since Tuesday. ##Cases## Panama will extend the suspension of all international flights for 30 more days due to the Covid-19 pandemic, according to a statement from the country's civil aviation authority published Tuesday. \"Humanitarian and necessary flights for the transport of medicines, vaccines or other essential health-supplies are exempted from these restrictions,\" the statement said.  The extension of the travel ban on international flights is scheduled to start on June 22 at midnight. Currently, Panama reports 21,962 cases of coronavirus and 457 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data.  ##Lockdowns## New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said today that Friday will be his last daily coronavirus briefing. The governor said that his office would still hold briefings on Covid-19 when it's necessary moving forward. Local Texas officials want Gov. Greg Abbott to require face masks but the governor's office says they have not imposed penalties already available to them, a spokesperson for Abbott tells CNN.  Nine Texas mayors, including the top officials in Houston, Dallas, Austin and San Antonio, have urged the state's governor to require face masks to stop Covid-19 from spreading in their cities.   \"None of these local officials have lifted a finger to impose penalties and enforcement mechanisms currently available to them. The one time a county judge did, a business owner wound up in jail,\" said John Wittman, a spokesperson for Abbott regarding the recent calls by mayors and county judges for the governor to allow them to enforce the use of masks.  Wittman seemed to refer to Shelley Luther, a Texas salon owner, who was sent to jail for seven days for violating the state's stay-at-home order.  \"No one could be jailed for not wearing a mask under my or the City of Dallas' orders,\" Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins said earlier this week. \"I’m simply asking the governor to lead on the masking requirement the medical experts say is the single most important thing we can do right now.\"   \"All of us have a collective responsibility to educate the public that wearing a mask is the best thing to do. Putting people in jail, however, is the wrong approach for this thing and that's exactly what I believe the Dallas County judge wants to do,\" Abbott said in during a briefing Tuesday.   Local officials \"have the ability to impose fines, not for face masks, but for other strategies\" like certain gatherings, Abbott said.   Texas currently has 93,044 Covid-19 cases and 2,044 coronavirus-related deaths, according to John Hopkins University. It is among the at least 21 states that are seeing upward trends in newly reported cases from one week to the next. New York City is on tack to begin phase two of reopening on Monday, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said at a news conference. The city is meeting its thresholds for reopening, and will have been in phase one for 14 days by Monday, Cuomo said at a news conference \"We don't change the rules for New York City,\" Cuomo said of the metric thresholds. Here's what phase two means: Phase two allows for a wider range of businesses to continue to reopen under Covid-19 guidelines, including retail businesses and offices, according to the state's reopening website.  New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has announced that once the city enters phase two, restaurants will be able to open for outdoor seating, and convert parking spaces into seating areas. Malls, gyms, movie theaters and casinos will remain closed in phase two. ##Reopening## New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said that 17 more people died in the state from coronavirus, adding that is the \"lowest number since we started. \"The only way I could feel better is if that number ever becomes zero,\" he said. ##Cases## At least five additional Covid-19 testing sites will open across New York City this week, Mayor de Blasio announced today. The sites will open across Brooklyn, Staten Island, Bronx and Queens, the mayor says. This comes as the Covid-19 indicators continue to be below the city's threshold for reopening. As of June 15, the city's indicators are as follows: Covid-19 hospital admissions are at 55.\nPatients in ICU’s at New York City Heath and Hospital are at 333\n2% of NYC residents tested positive for Covid-19 The mayor is hoping to make a final decision on the city beginning phase two in the next few days, De Blasio said. ##Reopening## Health officials from various nations met in a World Health Organization webinar on Wednesday to discuss the impact of Covid-19 on fights against neglected tropical disease around the world. Global experts have long warned that the coronavirus pandemic could influence how nations are impacted by and responding to other communicable diseases — including neglected tropical diseases, a diverse group of illnesses that prevail in tropical and subtropical conditions across 149 countries.  Neglected tropical diseases or NTDs, such as dengue and guinea worm disease, affect about 1 in 6 people worldwide.  \"In Rwanda, like many other countries in the world, we are fighting one enemy which is Covid-19 but other health essential programs may be also important to watch and follow so that we don't have double damage in this context,\" Dr. Sabin Nsanzimana, director general of Rwanda Biomedical Centre, said during Wednesday's webinar. \"The evolving situation of Covid-19 has been always managed in the context that we adapt to what we see,\" Nsanzimana said. For instance, the distribution of essential health services or drug prescriptions to treat or prevent NTDs or other illness could be extended to eliminate the risk of someone breaking Covid-19 social distancing guidelines to access medications. \"I see a lot of things will be turning around — how we strengthen our health systems to deal with different threats,\" Nsanzimana said. \"There’s expectation that we’re probably going to work double or work harder than before to prevent the consequences of infectious and neglected tropical diseases forward. … We don’t know what is going to be the next pandemic.\" In January 2012, WHO published a document that provides a \"roadmap\" for countries to follow in tackling neglected tropical diseases.  The document establishes goals for nations to reach while working to control, prevent, eliminate and even eradicate certain NTDs. That roadmap was revised this year with new guidelines and goals for the year 2030.  Mwelecele Malecela, director of WHO's Department of Control of Neglected Tropical Diseases, said in a written announcement about the webinar, that shifts are needed both during and after Covid-19 to achieve the roadmap targets for 2030.  \"WHO’s upcoming road map for neglected tropical diseases for 2021–2030 proposes a new model of operation,\" Malecela said in the announcement. \"This road map, with its major shifts, is even more relevant in the context of Covid-19 as it promotes resilience, health system strengthening, community participation, equity, country ownership and enhanced partner involvement through integrated, multisectoral collaboration.\" Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, WHO's regional director for Africa, said during Wednesday's webinar that some of the methods used and steps taken to tackle neglected tropical diseases could be adopted in response to Covid-19 and vice versa. \"Those methods of helping people to understand, to incorporate, to be empowered to take action have been very much part of the NTD community-level interventions and they’re very much needed now so that people understand that I have to keep my distance, I have to wear my mask above my nose all the time,\" Moeti said. \"We’ve seen that many people working in the programs have been repurposed to support the pandemic.\" New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has tested negative for coronavirus, his press secretary Freddi Goldstein said in a tweet this morning. De Blasio was tested after canceling scheduled public events on Monday because he “woke up feeling under the weather.”   This season’s UEFA Champions League will be completed with a \"Final Eight\" mini-tournament that will be held in Lisbon in August, European football’s governing body UEFA announced today. The competition was suspended in mid-March before the Round of 16 stage had been completed, as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. The quarterfinals and semifinals will be staged over one leg, instead of the usual two, with the final being held at Benfica’s stadium – Estádio do Sport Lisboa e Benfica – on Sunday, August 23. Four Round of 16 – second leg matches are still to be played, with Juventus still due to host Lyon, Manchester City scheduled to play Real Madrid, Bayern Munich defending a 3-0 lead against Chelsea and Barcelona's tie with Napoli poised at 1-1 from the first leg in Italy. UEFA stated those games would be played on August 7 and 8, pending a decision on whether they will take place at the home team’s stadiums or in Portugal. A final decision will be made on July 10 when the draw for the Quarter-Finals and Semi-Finals will be made at UEFA’s Headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland. Paris Saint-Germain, Atletico Madrid, Atalanta and RB Leipzig have already qualified for the UEFA Champions League – quarterfinals. Istanbul, which was due to host the 2020 UEFA Champions League Final, will now instead be the venue for the 2021 edition, with all other scheduled hosts moving back a year, UEFA added. UEFA also announced that this season’s UEFA Europa League would follow a similar \"Final Eight\" format with games to be held in four cities in Germany – Duisburg, Duesseldorf, Gelsenkirchen and Cologne – from August 10 – 21. The UEFA Europa League Final will be played in Cologne on August 21. A group of GOP senators all wore face masks to a news conference to where they unveiled their police reform plan. When each senator approached the lectern to speak, he or she removed his or her mask. The senators put their masks back on when they returned to the sides of the podium.  This is in contrast to how the White House how handled events and news conferences in the pandemic: In the Rose Garden on Tuesday afternoon, President Trump announced an executive order on policing without a mask on.  And by the look of a video the White House sent out on Twitter shortly afterward, almost no one in attendance wore a mask either. A group of 16 friends all tested positive for coronavirus after a night out at a recently reopened Florida bar. They now want to warn and remind the American public that the pandemic is not over yet.  Three members of the group spoke to CNN's Chris Cuomo on Tuesday night, and said they want others to be more cautious about taking advantage of looser coronavirus restrictions. \"We want to raise awareness and get ahead of it,\" Kat Layton told Cuomo. \"We want to tell people it's really not ready for what we thought it was ready for, it's too soon.\" The group had gathered for a friend's birthday, they said. The bar was crowded, and no one was wearing masks. \"Standing there in front of those people, we knew we were pushing it,\" Layton said. At the time, the virus was \"out of sight, out of mind\" since they didn't know anyone who had contracted it and they heard from their mayor and governor that everything was fine, Erika Crisp said. But within days, they started getting sick. \"Receiving the text messages that my friends were just boom, positive, boom, positive, boom, positive, back to back to back, it was overwhelming,\" Dara Sweat told Cuomo. Everyone in the group tested positive; and though some had flu like symptoms, none got seriously ill. The women said they are confident they contracted the virus on that outing. Since then, they said, they have been messaged by strangers who also got sick after visiting the same bar that weekend. Though Florida is continuing to reopen from coronavirus restrictions, the state recorded a record number of new cases on Monday, according to the Florida Department of Health. WATCH THE INTERVIEW:  ##Cases## A large German meat processing plant has been hit an outbreak of coronavirus. Sven-Georg Adenauer, the district administrator for Guetersloh in North Rhine Westfalia state says 400 new infections of employees at Toennies meat production in the nearby Rheda-Wiedenbrueck plant have been registered. “We can only say sorry to those affected,” Andre Vielstaedte, press officer at meat producer Toennies, said at a press conference called after news of the outbreak Wednesday. “We will do everything to get the virus out of the processing plant, and that we are ready to work thereafter.” Production has been stopped, he said.  Dr Gereon Schulze Althoff, director of quality management and veterinary services at Toennies said the plant had a lot of foreign workers, many of whom had over the holidays in May and early June gone home and thus travelled and may have had the virus traveling with them. “Our plants have not been built for a pandemic,” Schulze Althoff said at the press conference, describing how the plant had not been built with social distancing in mind. Toennies is a well-known family-run business which describes itself as “active at several levels of the food industry. The international company operates in eight divisions, has approximately 16,500 employees, and in 2018 generated annual revenue of EUR 6.65 billion,” per its website.   ##Cases## US stocks inched higher on Wednesday, in an effort to keep the rally going. After Tuesday’s massive rally that had the Dow jump more than 800 points at its best, markets have pulled back some as investors are digesting more reports of increasing coronavirus infections. Still, we’re looking at the fourth-straight day of gains for US stocks. Here is where things stood at opening:  The Dow opened up 0.2%, or 50 points.\nThe S&P 500 kicked off 0.3% higher.\nThe Nasdaq Composite rose 0.5%.  ##Economy## The head of the Federal Aviation Administration will tell Congress today he expects airplane passengers to wear a face mask when directed to by flight attendants, according to his prepared testimony shared by the FAA.    Administrator Dickson’s testimony says the Transportation Department and FAA “expect the traveling public to follow airline crew directions and policies, which are in place for passenger protection and the health of air crews, and to take very seriously the precautions recommended by the CDC and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).”   Neither the DOT nor FAA have made mask-wearing in airports and on airplanes a federal requirement.  Secretary Elaine Chao said recently she believes government regulation in this area would be too heavy handed and inflexible.   “Secretary Chao and the Department of Transportation have been clear that passengers should wear face coverings while traveling by air, for their own protection and the protection of those around them,” Dickson is set to say.  “Face coverings are especially important in situations where social distancing is not feasible.”     The first patient in a phase 3 trial was dosed with a drug from Eli Lilly that the pharmaceutical company hopes can help hospitalized patients with Covid-19.   The drug — named baricitinib and marketed as Olumiant — is a therapy approved to treat adults that have moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis.  The phase 3 study will enroll 400 patients with Covid-19 who have at least one marker for inflammation but have not been put on a ventilator by the start of the study. The study looks at whether the drug could reduce cytokine storm, the body’s hyper-inflammatory response to the virus and a severe complication that can come with Covid-19 infection.  About the trial: The trial will be conducted in the United States, Latin America and Europe. Lilly said the company should know how well the therapy works in a couple of months.  This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Patients will get standard care or they will be treated with baricitinib for 14 days or until they are discharged from the hospital. The study will measure if someone improves, if they are put on a ventilator by day 28, or if they die.  The drug is also being used in a few other trials with Covid-19 patients. In one trial by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, scientists are trialing the drug in combination with Gilead’s antiviral remdesivir.  ##The Future## Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said baseball season should not extend past October to avoid the risk of spreading Covid-19. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times on Tuesday, Fauci said Major League Baseball (MLB) should conclude the postseason in September over concerns of a second coronavirus wave in the fall. “If the question is time, I would try to keep it in the core summer months and end it not with the way we play the World Series, until the end of October when it’s cold,\" Fauci said. MLB and the Major League Baseball Players Association, the player's union, are still negotiating a shortened baseball season. Both sides remain at odds over health protocols and the length of the season.  Fauci explained that even with the current warm weather, there's been an increase in the number of new coronavirus cases as states continue to reopen, but said \"the chances of there being less of an issue in the end of July and all of August and September are much, much better than if you go into October.” “This virus is one that keeps fooling us. Under most circumstances — but we don’t know for sure here — viruses do better when the weather starts to get colder and people start spending more time inside, as opposed to outside,\" Fauci told the LA Times. \"The community has a greater chance of getting infected.\" Fauci said he misses watching his hometown team, the World Series champion Washington Nationals. But he told the LA Times he would go to a game in the stadium if there is limited capacity, spaced out seating and everyone is required to wear a mask — and if the infection rate in Washington, DC declines further.  The European Union on Wednesday put forward a strategy that would see the European Commission centrally purchase a Covid-19 vaccine on behalf of all EU countries. In addition, to ensure the quick development and delivery of the vaccine, the plan would also see the commission pay upfront for some of the costs faced by vaccine producers, in exchange for the right to buy a set number of doses at a fixed price. “At its core, joint action at EU level will allow all member states to increase the likelihood of finding an effective vaccine and to secure the necessary volume for our citizens at a good price,\" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said when announcing the plan.  The commission launching the strategy said centralizing \"vaccine procurement at EU level has the merit of speed and efficiency by comparison with 27 separate processes.\" They added, “No Member State on its own has the capacity to secure the investment in developing and producing a sufficient number of vaccines.” The commission believes that its EU-wide approach will create a number of advantages for both EU countries and producers.  For vaccine producers, the commission says their process would cut red tape and offer a “significantly simplified negotiation process with a single point of contact.” How the process would work: To enable rapid deployment of a vaccine across the EU, the commission would centrally negotiate with individual producers and invest in all stages of development from clinical trials to increasing capacity along the entire production chain to allow for large-scale production of the vaccine. In return for investing upfront, the commission would have “the right to buy a specified number of vaccine doses in a given timeframe and at a given price,” according to their plan. To finance this plan, the commission is proposing to use a new 2.7 billion euro fund called the Emergency Support Instrument which was created to help EU member states recover from the Covid-19 pandemic. For EU countries, the commission believes member states, “would be able to benefit from purchasing vaccines through a single procurement action,” and would also benefit from the “scientific and regulatory expertise of the Commission.”  The commission is also asking countries to “participate in the process from the start” and “contribute their expertise on potential vaccine candidates”. Last week France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands formed the Inclusive Vaccine Alliance to pool the national resources of those countries to secure 400 million doses of a vaccine being developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford.  ##The Future##  A “doctors’ group” has banded together as an offshoot of the White House coronavirus task force, a source close to the task force told CNN. Members of the group include Dr. Deborah Birx, Dr. Anthony Fauci, Dr. Stephen Hahn and Dr. Robert Redfield. The source said the doctors’ group meets two to three times a week by phone and then briefs Vice President Mike Pence. One of these briefings is scheduled for today, when the group plans to raise the issue of increased infection rates in many states. Remember: President Trump declared last month that his coronavirus task force would continue \"indefinitely\" after he and Pence said they were phasing out the health-focused panel in favor of a group focused on reopening the economy. The reversal came after outcry and concern from outside health experts, who said it was too early to disband the health-focused panel.  Currently, there are 21 states with infection rates trending upward in newly reported cases from one week to the next. More than 2 million people in the US have been infected with coronavirus and more than 116,900 have died, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.  Health experts are warning that more infections and deaths are in store as states continue their reopening plans. Here's how states are trending in new cases from one week to the next: 21 states are seeing upward trends in newly reported cases from one week to the next: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Kansas, Oregon, Louisiana, Montana, Nevada, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, West Virginia and Wyoming.\n8 states are seeing steady numbers of newly reported cases: Connecticut, Indiana, Maine, Mississippi, Ohio, South Dakota, Utah and Washington.\n21 states are seeing a downward trend: Colorado, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Wisconsin.\nOne state, Vermont, has seen a decrease of at least 50%. ##Cases## New Zealand’s Prime Minister said on today that the two new coronavirus cases reported on yesterday was due to an “unacceptable failure of the system.” “This case represents an unacceptable failure of the system. It should never have happened and it cannot be repeated” said Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern. The cases marked the first instances of coronavirus in New Zealand to be reported in 24 days, according to the country's Ministry of Health. The two cases are both women from the same family who arrived in New Zealand from the UK via Australia and were permitted on compassionate grounds to leave an isolation hotel in Auckland and travel to Wellington via private vehicle to visit a relative who has since died, Director-General of Health Dr. Ashley Bloomfield said in news conference yesterday. Ardern also announced on today that she would appoint the military to oversee New Zealand’s quarantine process saying, \"I am appointing the assistant Chief of Defense Air Commodore Darryn Webb to oversee all quarantine and managed isolation facilities, including the processes around the exit of those who have been in these facilities.”  “From the beginning, we have taken an extraordinarily cautious approach at the border. That is why we have required every returning New Zealander to go into a facility that we manage. That protocol remains,” Ardern said.  ##Cases##  Around 356,000 people linked to the Xinfadi market coronavirus cluster have been tested according to Beijing officials. Those tested include residents in the surrounding communities, those who have been tracked by big data and personnel in various markets across the city according to Zhang Qiang, an official with the Beijing government.  Beijing’s testing capacity currently stands at around 400,000 tests a day but will continue to increase, the Beijing official said.  Zhang added that some residents were tested after reporting themselves to authorities during “community door-knocking initiatives.”   The Mayor of London Sadiq Khan says he will take an \"immediate\" 10% pay cut to his $191,574 (£152,734) salary because London's public finances \"are facing unprecedented challenges\" due to the \"devastating impact\" of Covid-19. \"In these extremely difficult times, I promise to do all I can to protect our city’s frontline services. This includes taking an immediate pay cut,\" Khan tweeted Wednesday. The Greater London Authority (GLA) -- the devolved regional governing body of London, which Khan is in charge of -- faces a forecast £493 million ($618 million) budget shortfall over the next two years “as a result of an unprecedented loss of business rates and council tax income, caused by Covid-19, that is hitting every local authority in the country,” according to a press release. He urged the UK government to support local and regional authorities across the UK, warning that London's Metropolitan Police, London Fire Brigade, Transport for London and the GLA will otherwise face \"significant cuts\" at the \"worst possible time.\" “Londoners did the right thing to tackle Covid-19 by following the rules, staying at home and helping to save lives. But now the government is punishing them with a new era of austerity,\" Khan said in a statement. “Unless ministers act, the current number of police officers will need to be reduced and it will be impossible to tackle youth violence or make the changes to the London Fire Brigade that are desperately needed after the awful Grenfell Tower tragedy.” The salaries of Khan's 15 direct political appointments will also be frozen as part of the cost-saving measures. A German pharmaceutical company has been authorized to launch human trials for a vaccine against coronavirus by the federal institute for Vaccines and Biomedicines. CureVac, a company based in Tuebingen, will start testing on 168 healthy volunteers and is the 11th authorized clinical trial for a preventive vaccine globally. The announcement comes on the same day that a district of the German capital has placed more than 300 households into quarantine after 57 new outbreaks were registered.    Norwegian Air is to operate 76 European routes from its Scandinavian hubs from July, the low cost airline announced on Wednesday. At the peak of the outbreak in April, the airline reduced their fleet to eight aircraft on domestic Norwegian routes. The airline will reintroduce 12 aircraft to facilitate the European routes. According to a statement, these routes will include popular tourist destinations such as “Spain, Greece and key European cities.” In the short-term the airline has planned to operate flights between London Gatwick to Oslo, London Gatwick to Copenhagen, Edinburgh to Oslo and Edinburgh to Copenhagen from July 1. According to Norwegian Air: “London to Oslo will be operated seven times a week, London to Copenhagen six times a week, Edinburgh to Oslo and Copenhagen twice a week respectively.” The airline said travelers aged six years and older must use a facemask, as recommended by the European aviation authorities.   It's been 100 days since a ball was last kicked in the English Premier League.  While many fans are getting excited, not everyone is convinced now is the right time to return. On Wednesday, Aston Villa hosts Sheffield United, while Manchester City faces Arsenal. All of the league's remaining 92 fixtures will be held behind closed doors. However, a recent YouGov survey found that 48% of adults thought the Premier League was returning too soon as the UK emerges tentatively from lockdown. The restart comes at a point when some regions, such as the northwest of England, have been identified as potential hotspots for the virus with infection rates decreasing more slowly. There have also been concerns whether fans might congregate outside of stadiums, notably in the city of Liverpool where Jurgen Klopp's side could clinch its first league title in 30 years with victory over local rival Everton on Sunday if Arsenal beats Manchester City. Read the full story. More than 300 households in the Berlin district of Neukoelln have been placed into quarantine, after 57 new infections were registered.  Christian Berg from the Neukoelln Town Hall told CNN that seven apartment buildings had been affected in the densely populated district in the capital. Germany's response to the pandemic has been widely praised, with only 8,840 deaths due to the virus relative to its population of more than 80 million people.  Chancellor Angela Merkel has received particular credit for installing a rigorous testing regime early on while showing effective and compassionate leadership.  She, along with French President Emmanuel Macron, have taken the lead on the European Union's response to the virus, steering the bloc towards agreeing a €500 billion recovery package.  Matt Hancock, the UK's Health Secretary, has said dexamethasone, the steroid that has emerged as a treatment for those worst affected by coronavirus, is “brilliant news for everybody,” but that it is not a cure. Speaking to Sky News Wednesday morning, Hancock, pictured above, said “this is really really good progress, it is one of the best pieces of news we have had through this whole crisis.” On Tuesday, two investigators of the Recovery Trial, a large UK-based trial for potential Covid-19 treatments, said that a low-dose of dexamethasone was found to reduce the risk of death by a third among hospitalized patients requiring ventilation in the trial. Hancock added that it was important to not re-import the virus from nations now seeing a spike in cases. “We have got to have the quarantine program in overall because there are some countries where it‘s increasingly looking as if the virus is out of control,” he said. The R-rate, which reflects the speed at which the virus is spreading, is below 1, according to the “latest science,” Hancock said. A number above 1 means each case is passed to more than one other individual, causing the disease to continue its spread.  A South Dakota company expects to start human trials next month for a Covid-19 antibody treatment derived from the plasma of cows.  But these aren't just any cows. Scientists genetically engineered the animals to give them an immune system that's part human. That way, the animals produce disease-fighting human antibodies to Covid-19, which are then turned into a drug to attack the virus.  \"These animals are producing neutralizing antibodies that kill (the novel coronavirus) in the laboratory,\" Eddie Sullivan, CEO of SAB Biotherapeutics said in a statement to CNN. \"We are eager to advance to the clinic as we move forward in the regulatory process with the hopes of bringing this potential COVID-19 therapeutic to patients in need of a solution.\"  The company did not say how many people would be studied in the clinical trials or how long they would take. Read more on how it's done: The families of six US oil executives detained in Venezuela are pleading for their release as concerns mount over their health amid the global coronavirus pandemic. The \"CITGO 6\" -- Tomeu Vadell, Gustavo Cardenas, Jorge Toledo, Alirio Jose Zambrano, Jose Luis Zambrano and Jose Angel Pereira -- have been detained in Venezuela without trial since November 2017.  As the virus threatens Venezuela's collapsing medical system and reports have emerged of cases within the prison facility where the men are held, family members say their loved ones are in \"mortal danger.\"  And despite calls from US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to release the men, there are no indications that embattled Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro -- with whom the US has severed diplomatic ties -- is any closer to ending their two-and-a-half-year plight. On Friday, US Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs Roger Carstens revealed that two of the men \"now have flu symptoms on top of other health issues.\" Read the full story: The pandemic has kick-started a difficult global conversation about whether Western liberal democracies should radically rethink their relationships with China, an authoritarian regime upon whom many of these nations' economies rely. This has been especially confronting for the European Union, which has spent the past few years actively seeking greater engagement and cooperation with Beijing, with the ultimate goal of smoother two-way investment and access to one another's considerable markets.  At a glance, an EU-China reset looks simple enough.  Despite the bloc's move towards China, the transatlantic relationship is the cornerstone of the United States-led Western order. A European pause on the current talks with China to take stock of what's happened and what European priorities might be post-Covid, while economically costly, could be wise. It would also be welcome and popular in Washington. However, China's actions since the pandemic began have not led to the conclusion in Brussels that now is the time for Europe to go cold on China. Read the full story: With the Covid-19 pandemic halting many of the world's commercial airline flights, some in the aviation industry have had to find alternative ways to earn an income while grounded.  Pilots are no exception.  In Thailand, where domestic tourism is only just starting to pick up this month following an easing in lockdown restrictions, some aviators have shifted from the skies to the roads, taking on jobs delivering food by motorbike or as drivers for car-hailing apps.  These include co-pilot Nakarin Inta, who has been a commercial pilot for about four years. He's now delivering orders for Line Man, a local messenger app. \"Some (airline staff) have been on leave without pay,\" he tells CNN Travel. \"And for most of us the income has been cut off more than 70%. I still have expenses every month so I had to find something on my own.\" And he's not alone. With multiple airlines reducing flights to the bare minimum, Inta says he knows of more than 50 Thai pilots -- including some personal friends -- now working either as food delivery men, ride-hailing app drivers or food vendors while waiting to resume their regular jobs.  Some are even using their luxury vehicles for their part-time job, such as BMW motorbikes and sedans, says Inta. \"I think everybody (was impacted) by Covid-19, everyone in the world, but look at the one beside you, your loved ones. You have to fight for them and fight for yourself,\" says the pilot. Read the full story: More than 8.1 million cases of novel coronavirus have been confirmed worldwide, including at least 443,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. If you're just joining us, here's the latest on the pandemic: Beijing measures: The Chinese capital canceled 70% of commercial flights from two of its major airports as part of efforts to contain a new outbreak that's infected more than 130 people in the past five days. Authorities have imposed a soft lockdown on the entire city. \nUS cases: Texas and Florida saw their highest single-day increase in cases on Tuesday, the same day US Vice President Mike Pence tried to declare coronavirus over in the country. He penned an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal claiming there is \"no second wave\" of coronavirus and suggested the rise in US cases was down to an increase in testing. \nLawsuit against Trump rally dismissed: A judge has denied an emergency motion to stop US President Donald Trump's campaign rally in Tulsa on Saturday. Lawyers asked the court to block the event unless organizers agreed to adhere to the administration's own social distancing recommendations to limit the spread of the virus. \nBorder restrictions: Mexico and the United States have agreed to extend restrictions on travel over their shared land border through July 21. The US-Canada border will also remain closed to most travel until July 21.\nHuman antibody trials: A South Dakota company expects to start human trials next month for a Covid-19 antibody treatment derived from the plasma of cows. The animals are genetically engineered to produce disease-fighting human antibodies to Covid-19, which are then turned into a drug to attack the virus. \nReducing transmission: A combination of physical distancing, isolation and contact tracing could be the most effective way to control transmission of Covid-19, researchers in Britain found. \nBrazil cases: The country reported a new daily high of 34,918 new cases on Tuesday, bringing the country’s total to 923,189.\nHonduran President tests positive: President Juan Orlando Hernández says he has been diagnosed with coronavirus and has mild symptoms. The country's first lady has also tested positive and is asymptomatic. ##Catch Up## Germany is seeing a slight uptick in deaths from Covid 19 -- in the past 24 hours, 30 people have died from the disease, according to the Robert Koch Institute. The RKI -- Germany's national agency for disease control and prevention -- reported that 8,830 people in total have died from coronavirus in the country.  Germany reported 345 new Covid-19 cases on Tuesday, bringing the nationwide total to 187,184, according to the RKI. ##Cases## New research on the commonly used steroid drug dexamethasone in helping to treat the sickest Covid-19 patients is “brilliant news for everybody,” but is not a cure, UK Health Minister Matt Hancock said on Sky News today. “This is really really good progress, it is one of the best pieces of news we have had through this whole crisis,” Hancock said. The findings are preliminary, still being compiled and have not been published in a peer-reviewed journal -- but some not involved with the study called the results a breakthrough. Researchers announced that a low-dose regimen of dexamethasone for 10 days was found to reduce the risk of death by a third among hospitalized patients requiring ventilation in the trial. Dr. Jonathan Reiner, former Vice President Dick Cheney’s cardiologist, said the first wave of the pandemic is still “burning hotly” in large parts of the US, even if the White House doesn’t want you to know about it.  “The administration and the vice president are peddling an alternative reality that just doesn’t jibe with what is truly happening in this country,” Reiner told CNN’s Don Lemon.  Reiner is currently a professor of medicine at George Washington University.  He said some parts of the country did an amazing job beating back the coronavirus, like New York, Massachusetts, and Illinois, where new reported case numbers have fallen. But in the South and Southwest, places like Florida, Texas, and Arizona, “new cases and hospitalizations are increasing dramatically.” He believes the vice president and President’s choice to hold a rally this weekend is “criminal endangerment” and he criticized the Republican leaders for making appearances without wearing masks.  “The most powerful tool we have to prevent the virus from spreading is social distancing and wearing a mask, but it interferes with the primary motivation for this administration right now, which is to be re-elected, and to be re-elected you have to pretend that we are not in a pandemic, you have to pretend that 120,000 people almost haven’t died, you have to pretend that 40 million people aren’t out of work,” Reiner said. “And the way you do that is by not wearing masks in public, but it has a direct negative consequence on the public health of this country. It’s disgraceful.” A judge has denied an emergency motion to stop US President Donald Trump's campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on Saturday. The decision came after local lawyers asked the court to block the event unless organizers agreed to take steps to adhere to the administration's own social distancing recommendations to limit the spread of coronavirus.

On Tuesday, Beijing raised its alert level from Level 3 to Level 2 -- the highest alert being Level 1. Authorities imposed a soft lockdown on the entire city after the Chinese capital reported more than 100 new locally transmitted coronavirus cases in the past five days.

The inmate must also have housing plans identified before participating in the program and will remain under close supervision for the duration of their sentence, up to 180 days, the news release states. After serving the remainder of their time at home, “they will remain on state parole supervision, transfer to county post-release community supervision, or discharge from their sentence, depending on their post-release requirements.”  The news release also notes that inmates participating in the community supervision program can be remanded back to state prison for any reason to serve the remainder of their sentence. CDCR has reduced the inmate population by more than 8,000 since mid-March through the suspension of county jail intake and expediting parole of approximately 3,500 inmates in April, according to the news release.

Let’s not back down! Wear your masks, practice social distancing, and wash your hands.\" ##Lockdowns## Erika Crisp was one of 16 friends who tested positive for coronavirus after one night out at a recently reopened Florida bar. She told CNN's Chris Cuomo that she now regrets her decision to go out that night. “At the time it was more ‘out of sight, out mind,’ we hadn’t known anybody who had it personally, governor, mayor, everybody says it’s fine, we go out and it’s a friend’s birthday, it was a mistake,” Crisp said.  “I feel foolish, it’s too soon, clearly we got super-sick almost immediately, within days.” Kat Layton echoed Crisp’s sentiments, and says she hopes her story will serve as a cautionary tale for others who might be itching for a return to a crowded bar.  “My experience is definitely of course, regretful. We feel foolish, standing there in front of those people, we knew we were pushing it,” Layton said, “We want to raise awareness and get ahead of it, we want to tell people it’s really not ready for what we thought it was ready for, it’s too soon.” Dara Sweat told Cuomo she grew apprehensive as the text messages from her friends began to pile up.  “I was a little scared and nervous, and receiving the text messages that my friends were just ‘boom, positive, boom, positive, boom, positive, back to back to back, it was overwhelming,\" she said.  ##Reopening## At least 24,219 new coronavirus cases and 840 virus-related deaths were recorded in the United States on Tuesday, according to Johns Hopkins University. A total of at least 2,137,707 Covid-19 infections, including 116,962 related fatalities, have now been recorded in the US, according to JHU. The totals include cases from all 50 states, the District of Columbia and other US territories, as well as repatriated cases.  CNN’s interactive map is tracking US cases: ##Cases## The Covid-19 pandemic seems to be following highways as it spreads, researchers from the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania said on Tuesday. The Policy Lab project team based at CHOP has been tracking cases across 384 US counties with active outbreaks.   What their model is seeing is that, predictably, as places open back up, people aren’t staying home. As more people interact with others, the disease spreads. And cases seem to be moving south to north along major traffic corridors -- highways like I-95 on the East Coast and I-85 in the South, and I-5 and I-10 in the West -- the team said. “We look at this data every week and noticed the trend along the highways. We don't look at traffic with this model, but we thought it was interesting,” Policy Lab spokesperson Lauren Walens said. What seems to slow the spread of the disease is the same that it has been from the beginning: staying home, wearing a mask, washing hands. “Personal vigilance,” Walens said, is key.  “It's impossible for us to know if everyone is wearing a mask or not,” Walens added. “There are all these variables. Temperature is one of them, but there's little difference between Atlanta and Jacksonville's weather, so weather can't explain the difference in the two cities. We think it’s in part mobility.” The group’s next model update will be released on Wednesday.  ##Reopening## The US Food and Drug Administration revoked its emergency use authorization for one of the first Covid-19 antibody tests granted such approval.  The FDA said it was concerned about the test’s accuracy.   The test was created by Chembio Diagnostic System, Inc. At the time the FDA gave its approval, the agency said it did meet the “may be effective” standard needed for the emergency use authorization. False results: The federal government continued to evaluate the test's performance and determined that it gave a higher than expected rate of false results.  The risk to public health from false test results make the revocation of this authorization appropriate, the FDA said on its website, adding that the test may not be distributed.  \"Since the beginning of the COVID-19 public health emergency, the FDA has balanced the urgent need for access to diagnostic and antibody tests with providing a level of oversight that helps to ensure accurate tests are being deployed,\" Dr. Jeff Shuren, director of the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health said in a news release. \n\"By continuing to monitor authorized tests and emerging scientific evidence, we are able to make changes when appropriate – including taking action when a test's benefits no longer outweigh its risks. Through these efforts, we are able to help assure that FDA-authorized tests meet the needs of the American public.\" On Monday, Florida saw almost 2,800 new coronavirus cases, according to the Florida Department of Health.  That's the highest single-day increase in confirmed infections the state has seen since the pandemic began.  While cases continue to increase in Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis told reporters in Tallahassee that they will not be \"shutting down.\" \"No, we're not shutting down, you know, we're going to go forward. We're going to continue to protect the most vulnerable. You know, we're going to urge, continue to advise, particularly our elderly population to maintain social distancing, avoid crowds,\" DeSantis said.

The rally is expected to draw a record-breaking turnout despite the risks of coronavirus spread. The administration has said it will distribute hand sanitizer and hand out masks, but that attendees are not required to wear them. “What he’s doing in Tulsa is criminal endangerment,” Dr. Jonathan Reiner, a cardiologist and professor of medicine at George Washington University, told CNN’s Erin Burnett. “He's intentionally exposing people to the risk of acquiring a deadly virus just for a photo op. He's risking the health of people for a photo op,” Reiner said. “The President needs a lot of people, wants the photo op and he doesn't really care what happens to the people who attend his rally,” he added. “I'm begging the people in Tulsa, don’t go to this. Watch it on television. Watch the President … and be safe at home. Do not go.” Mexico reported 4,599 new cases of the novel coronavirus on Tuesday, bringing the country’s total to 154,863.
