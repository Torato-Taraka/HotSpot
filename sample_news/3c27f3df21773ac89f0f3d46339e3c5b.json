Personally, it would be beneficial if we don’t accept any direct flights as of the moment,” Defensor said. “I personally would also want to have a lockdown. But it is not in our power to do so. It is within the national government.”With one nCov-positive case in the country, Defensor also called on the Bureau of Quarantine under the Department of Health (DOH) to coordinate with local governments in tracking down passengers that came to Iloilo, but had international flights that landed in Manila or Cebu.“If it’s allowed, we want to have the health declaration cards of the passengers. This is vital in knowing their travel history,” Defensor said.Meanwhile, calls are also mounting to stop flights to and from mainland China in other parts of the Western Visayas region. In particular, there is an ongoing petition at the world-famous Boracay Island in Malay town, Aklan province.Antique Rep. Loren Legarda also wanted a temporary ban of Chinese tourists.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "URL": "https://mb.com.ph/2020/01/31/iloilo-governor-urges-budget-airline-to-halt-flights-to-hong-kong-singapore/", "MainKeyWord": "Hong Kong", "AdditionalKeyWord": "Singapore", "Source": "MB"}
