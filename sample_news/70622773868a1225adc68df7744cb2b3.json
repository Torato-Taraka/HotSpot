They have also evolved into wider calls for democracy, among other demands.Mahathir, 94, is one of Asia’s most experienced leaders. He was prime minister for 22 years from 1981, only to come out of retirement last year to head a government after an opposition election victory.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "URL": "https://mb.com.ph/2019/10/04/malaysias-mahathir-says-hong-kong-leader-should-step-down-report/", "MainKeyWord": "Hong Kong", "AdditionalKeyWord": "Malaysia", "Source": "MB"}
