Restaurants will be able to serve until 2200 GMT.“The situation calls for tougher measures,” said Prime Minister Katrin Jakobsdottir.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "URL": "https://mb.com.ph/2021/03/25/finland-iceland-approve-astrazeneca-jab-for-seniors/", "MainKeyWord": "Hong Kong", "AdditionalKeyWord": "viet Nam", "Source": "MB"}
