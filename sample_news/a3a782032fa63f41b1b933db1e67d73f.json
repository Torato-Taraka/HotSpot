What could it mean?” he said.Del Rosario said this could mean that all relevant parties would need to exercise utmost vigilance in ensuring that the COC is not utilized by Beijing for the purpose of protecting what has been declared as being unlawful by the Hague court which is now an integral part of international law.He insisted that an ASEAN consensus on the issues raised in Vietnam’s position will serve to demonstrate to the world that the 10 member-states of the regional bloc as a solid body, “willing to strongly uphold its centrality and not allow itself to be bullied and bribed.”Del Rosario was the foreign affairs chief when the Philippines filed an arbitration case against China before the United Nations-backed Arbitral Tribunal at The Hague. On July 12, 2016, the Arbitration court ruled in favor of the Philippine petition.The Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, and Taiwan have conflicting claims with China in certain parts of the South China Sea.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "URL": "https://mb.com.ph/2019/01/02/del-rosario-ph-asean-should-fully-support-vietnams-tough-stance-against-china/", "MainKeyWord": "China", "AdditionalKeyWord": "viet Nam", "Source": "MB"}
