Coronavirus  After China spent the last few months getting the coronavirus under control, hundreds of millions of people there are expected to be on the move in the next few days as the country celebrates the National Day holiday. The eight-day Mid-Autumn Festival break is China's first major holiday since its peak of the Covid-19 crisis, and it will be a tense test of just how secure the country's pandemic response is. Meanwhile, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has extended the no-sail order for cruise ships through October 31. The CDC said recent outbreaks on cruise ships prove the vessels could be used to \"transmit and amplify\" the spread of the disease. More than 1 million people have died of the coronavirus worldwide, and the US death toll now stands at more than 206,900. 2. Election 2020 The Commission on Presidential Debates says it will make changes to the format of the remaining presidential debates to \"ensure a more orderly discussion\" after Tuesday night's event devolved into chaos. At least 73 million viewers tuned in to the debate, but the acrimonious clash sent ripples of uncertainty through Wall Street. As the election road winds on, the focus is still on voting accessibility and security. A federal judge dismissed a Trump campaign effort to prevent Montana from letting counties issue mail ballots, pointing to the fact that widespread voter fraud is a \"fiction.\" Facebook also announced it will not accept ads that spread doubt about voting methods or seek to delegitimize the election results. 3. Economy  American and United airlines are cutting 32,000 jobs as a federal prohibition on layoffs in the industry expires with no stimulus safety net in sight. American Airlines CEO Doug Parker said the cuts were unavoidable after attempts to get more federal aid failed. Things may have been different if Congress showed any movement in approving that $2.2 trillion stimulus package (which would have included $25 billion for the airline industry), but House Democrats have decided to hold off on a vote to garner more bipartisan support. Job cuts are also hitting Goldman Sachs. The bank paused layoffs during the pandemic to avoid sowing employee uncertainty. HBSC started slashing jobs due to the coronavirus crisis back in June, and Wells Fargo says layoffs will affect its ranks soon, too. 4. Immigration  Twenty-one people died in ICE custody in the fiscal year that ended yesterday. That's more than double the number of deaths in fiscal year 2019 and the highest annual death toll in 15 years. Immigrants rights advocates say the deaths are a sign of deteriorating conditions, serious problems with medical care and ICE's flawed approach to handling the pandemic. More than a third of those who died in ICE custody last year had tested positive for Covid-19. While ICE officials maintain that deaths in custody are extremely rare, the agency has faced growing scrutiny for how it handles even routine medical care. Two weeks ago, a former employee at an ICE facility in Georgia filed a complaint detailing high rates of hysterectomies and alleged medical neglect. 5. Malaysia US Customs and Border Protection is blocking palm oil and palm oil products from Malaysia over allegations of forced labor abuses, including physical and sexual violence, debt bondage, withholding of wages and use of child labor. The restrictions are part of a larger mission by the agency to target overseas forced labor practices. These kinds of crackdowns started increasing after a 2016 change in US law renewed CBP's mandate to block products made with forced labor. In the fiscal year 2020, the agency issued 13 such restrictions -- more than any other fiscal year.  BREAKFAST BROWSE Walmart is redesigning its stores to make things easier to find  Now maybe you won't emerge in a daze with bags full of stuff and no recollection of what you originally came in for.  'The Bachelorette' host Chris Harrison promises the 'most explosive' season fans have ever seen Is \"explosive\" something we want in a dating show?
