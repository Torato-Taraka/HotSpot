Most Malaysians are unable to buy those flats.”He added that Forest City “cannot be sold to foreigners… We are not going to give visas for people to come and live here.”His nationalist rhetoric was not in line with Malaysia’s laws — it is legal for foreigners to buy houses and apartments in Malaysia — and his office later clarified that he only meant purchasing property does not automatically guarantee residency for a foreigner.But observers said Mahathir was intending to undermine a project he has long detested. A subsequent announcement that the government was establishing a committee to review the terms agreed on to set up the development and foreign ownership there only added to the sense authorities may be trying to put a halt to it.It is not yet clear what the committee might recommend. Analysts said the worst case scenario in the short term could be the state government in Johor, where the project is based, raising the minimum price for foreigners buying property or increasing levies.Yeah Kim Leng, a professor of economics at Malaysia’s Sunway University Business School, said investors would be deterred and predicted the developer might have to delay or scale back the project.“Perhaps they will put it on hold, or aim for something smaller,” he told AFP.Malaysian property consultant Samuel Tan Wee Cheng meanwhile warned against turning “the project into a white elephant”, the Star newspaper reported.Only a fraction of work has been completed on the development and only a small number of people, mainly staff, are living there, according to reports.Chinese jittersDuring Najib’s nine-year rule, Chinese investment into Malaysia surged but hastily struck deals fuelled suspicion that the leader was seeking help to pay off debts from a massive financial scandal.While Forest City is a private project, it was perceived by many in Malaysia as another example of unwelcome mainland Chinese influence and there were fears it could become an enclave for wealthy Chinese.In reality, however, analysts say it is unclear who will inhabit the development, particularly as foreigners must apply for long-stay visas through a separate programme.With one-bedroom apartments being offered for about $170,000, the prices are out of reach for most Malaysians.Despite its troubles, Forest City has remained upbeat. A spokesman pointed out that of 20,000 properties launched by the end of last year, 18,000 have been sold, and stressed the development has brought investment and jobs to Malaysia. ", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "URL": "https://mb.com.ph/2018/09/05/malaysian-island-city-in-trouble-as-pm-targets-china-linked-projects/", "MainKeyWord": "China", "AdditionalKeyWord": "Malaysia", "Source": "MB"}
