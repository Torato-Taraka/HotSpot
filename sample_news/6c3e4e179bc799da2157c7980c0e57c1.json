{"Type": "article", "Time": "2021-01-14", "Headline": "January 15 coronavirus news", "Text": "Brazil's Supreme Court and a federal court in Amazonas have ordered the country's government to work to immediately resolve a severe oxygen shortage in the coronavirus-hit state.  Supreme Court Justice Ricardo Lewandowski ordered the federal government to take all actions within its power to alleviate the health crisis in Manaus, the Amazonas capital.  Lewandowski instructed the government to draw up a \"comprehensive and detailed\" plan with strategies to deal with the deadly emergency within 24 hours. He also directed the government to immediately find oxygen and other necessary supplies for the Covid-19 patients hospitalized in Manaus.  A federal court in Amazonas also intervened in the matter. A judge in Manaus ordered the federal government to immediately transfer all patients from the city’s public health system who may die due to lack of oxygen to places where they can get care.  The order issued on Thursday said it was the federal government's responsibility to send patients to other states.  ##Hotspots## The overwhelming majority of the more than 20,000 National Guard members expected in Washington, DC for President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration will not be tested for coronavirus before they are deployed from states or upon their arrival in the nation's capital, a National Guard spokesperson told CNN.  The Pentagon has authorized up to 25,000 National Guard members to help with inauguration security. Testing for National Guard members sent to DC is \"case dependent\" but not widely required, the spokesperson said, noting there are some screening procedures -- such as temperature checks -- in place. \"Incoming Guard men and women are screened upon departure from their individual states and upon arrival to the DC Armory according to CDC guidelines. Temperature checks and screening questions are in place; masks and social distancing are required where the mission allows,\" the DC National Guard said in a statement to CNN Friday. The National Guard encourages coronavirus testing to personnel who are symptomatic or exposed to the coronavirus. But as CNN has consistently reported, coronavirus can be spread by people who have no symptoms and, without testing, it is impossible to know whether any of the thousands of Guard members are carrying the virus. And they are being deployed with little warning. The troops are also arriving in large numbers with the US having had its deadliest 14 days in the pandemic. More than 3.2 million new coronavirus cases have been reported in the first two weeks of 2021, according to Johns Hopkins University data. Earlier this week, Ohio National Guard Maj. Gen. John Harris expressed his concern for deploying the National Guard in his state. \"I'll just remind you that these National Guard folks that we're bringing on duty were doing something else just a couple days ago and had no idea they'd be coming here,\" Harris said during a news conference. \"Bringing these folks together collectively -- it is a real concern for us.\" ##Hotspots## The Butantan health research institute in São Paulo will immediately deliver 6 million doses of the imported CoronaVac vaccine to the federal government following an urgent request from the Brazilian health ministry, according to a document signed by Butantan leadership and shared by the research institute with CNN. The health ministry underscored the “urgency” of immediately providing the vaccine -- which has yet to be approved by Brazilian regulators -- for use in the country's vaccination program, according to reporting first published in CNN Brasil, which posted the official health ministry document requesting the vaccines. On Thursday, Health Minister Gen. Eduardo Pazuello said the program will start on January 20.   Regulatory agency directors will vote this Sunday on whether to approve emergency use of CoronaVac, which was developed by the Chinese pharmaceutical company Sinovac and tested in Brazil in partnership with the Butantan Institute.   The Butantan Institute on Tuesday released general results of tests carried out in the country that indicate a vaccine efficacy of a 50.38%. ##Vaccines## The influential coronavirus model at the University of Washington is projecting 192,000 people will die from coronavirus in the US between now and May 1, bringing the total to 566,720 deaths by May 1. That’s the same number the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) projected in its last estimate, released December 23. The group says more rapid vaccination efforts can bring the number down to 553,000 and universal mask use would take it down even further to 535,000. The forecast offers some hope for the spring. “We expect the death toll will reach 567,000 by May 1, with a likely peak at the beginning of February,” IHME said in a statement. “Daily deaths are expected to decline steadily after the peak, reaching below 500 a day sometime in April due to seasonality and the scale-up of vaccination. By May 1, some states may be close to herd immunity.” The model assumes that 22% of the US population has been infected with the virus. “Despite huge reporting lags around the holidays leading to false declines in the last week of December and subsequent overestimated increases, it appears that there are two distinct groups of states. In most of the coastal states, cases, hospitalizations, and deaths are increasing, while the epidemic is trending down in much of the Midwest,” the IHME said. But new variants could change projections. Earlier Friday, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned a new variant called B. 1.1.7, first seen in Britain, could worsen the pandemic. “If more transmissible variants spread in the US in the coming weeks, the peak could be delayed by weeks and the death toll substantially increased,” IHME said. Either way, the worst is yet to come. “Hospitals in many states will be under severe stress in the next four weeks. Expanding mask use, timely reintroduction of some social distancing mandates, and more rapid scale-up of vaccination remain the best options for reducing the death toll.” The IHME team estimates 76% of Americans always wear a mask when leaving home.  “We expect that 141 million people will be vaccinated by May 1. With faster scale-up, the number vaccinated could reach 179 million people,” the IHME said. ��Daily deaths will peak at 3,680 on February 1, 2021,” IHME said. “Daily deaths are estimated to be well below 500 a day in the month of April. By May 1, 2021, we project that 37,800 lives will be saved by the projected vaccine rollout.” ##Hotspots##  Vaccine maker Pfizer says it has second doses of coronavirus vaccines ready to ship as needed – something that should reassure governors infuriated by the federal government’s announcement that it does not have a reserve stockpile of vaccine doses.  Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said Friday there was no reserve stockpile, even though the Trump administration has been telling states for weeks it is holding onto second doses of vaccine to make sure people who get one dose can get the second shot on time. Pfizer says it’s holding the vaccine doses. “Operation Warp Speed (OWS) has asked us to start shipping second doses only recently. As a result, we have on hand all the second doses of the previous shipments to the US. We are working around the clock to produce millions more each day,” Pfizer said in a statement sent to CNN. “We have and are continuing to work closely with OWS on our production, release and shipping schedules – to ensure Americans receive their first and second doses of the vaccine on time. We have provided OWS with a specific schedule and we foresee no issues in delivering on the commitments we have made,” the company added. “Our facility in Kalamazoo, MI, is the primary manufacturing site of our COVID-19 vaccine in the U.S. and we have shipped more than 15 million doses to destinations across the country as of today. We anticipate no interruptions in shipments at this facility, as we look to scale up our production of the vaccine to produce 2 billion doses worldwide by the end of 2021 (up from the previously communicated approximately 1.3 billion).” Pfizer is contracted to supply the US with 200 million doses. ##Vaccines## There is no “reserve stockpile” of Covid-19 vaccine doses left to release, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said in an interview with NBC’s Lester Holt Friday.  Though the Trump administration announced this week that it would release all available Covid-19 vaccine doses instead of holding second doses in reserve, a senior administration official told CNN Friday that many of those reserves were already released last year.  When asked whether there is in fact a reserve of second doses left to release, Azar said, “No. There’s not a reserve stockpile.” “We now have enough confidence that our ongoing production will be quality and available to provide the second dose for people, so we're not sitting on a reserve anymore,” he added. “We've made that available to the states to order.” Pfizer has told CNN it has the vaccine doses on hand to ship when the US asks for them. \"We have on hand all the second doses of the previous shipments to the US. We are working around the clock to produce millions more each day,” Pfizer said in a statement. ##Vaccines## Pfizer chairman and CEO Albert Bourla said Friday he supports President-elect Joe Biden’s plan to try to speed up coronavirus vaccination in the US. Biden laid out a broad outline Friday for vaccinating more people, saying he would try to get Congress to hire more public health professionals, would try to expand vaccination sites and would broaden the type of personnel approved to administer vaccines. Bourla, whose company makes the first coronavirus vaccine to be authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration, applauded Biden’s words. “This comprehensive federal plan utilizes as many doses as possible, opens up eligibility to a broader set of Americans, and ensures equity by focusing on the hardest hit communities,” Bourla said in a statement. “We are particularly aligned with the ideas of federally assisted vaccination centers, financial support to the States, mobile clinics to reach underserved urban areas and rural communities, vaccine availability in pharmacies and qualified health centers and an expanded public health workforce.\" The US is contracted to buy 200 million doses of Pfizer/BioNTech’s vaccine. ##Vaccines## North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum on Friday announced the state health officer’s statewide mask mandate will be allowed to expire on Monday.  Speaking during a news briefing, Burgum said that while officials are seeing lower Covid-19 numbers across the state, \"we must remain vigilant.\" The governor encouraged the public to keep wearing masks \"as part of the important work that we need to do to contain this virus and to maintain the strong position that we're in.\"  The mask order initially took effect Nov. 14 and was extended from Dec. 14 until Jan. 18, when it will expire, according to a news release from the governor's office. \"The extension to Jan. 18 allowed for a 14-day incubation period to pass after Christmas and New Year’s to ensure the state wouldn’t see a surge in cases,\" according to the release.  Burgum also announced the executive order that limits capacities at bars, restaurants, and event venues will be modified from requirements to recommendations. This change will also take effect Monday.   President-elect Joe Biden promised to help vaccinate more Americans against coronavirus by approving a wider range of professionals who can administer vaccines. He also said he would ask Congress to hire 100,000 more public health professionals. In a fact sheet released before Biden addressed the nation to lay out his coronavirus vaccination plans, the Biden transition team promised to “surge the public health workforce.” “President-elect Biden has asked Congress to make an historic investment in expanding the public health workforce, funding 100,000 public health workers to nearly triple​ the country’s community health roles,” the fact sheet reads. “These individuals will be​ hired to work in their local communities to perform vital tasks like vaccine outreach and contact tracing in the near term, and to transition into community health roles to build our long-term public health capacity ​that will help improve quality of care and reduce hospitalization for low-income and underserved communities.”  State and local public health officials have said their services have lost many staff over the past 15 years and say they don’t have the personnel needed to effectively manage the pandemic.  Biden also said he’d work to immediately expand those who are OK'd to give vaccines. “President-elect Biden will address workforce needs by taking steps to allow additional qualified professionals to administer vaccines and strongly encourage states to use their flexibility fully to surge their workforce, including by expanding scope of practice laws and waiving licensing requirements as appropriate,” the statement reads. “The federal government, in partnership with states, will provide appropriate training, including thorough use of the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps.” The Public Health Service Commissioned Corps is a little-known branch of the US military that includes medical professionals. Many Centers for Disease Control and Prevention staff are members of the Public Health Service corps. “The president-elect will also act swiftly to amend the current COVID-19 Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act declaration to permit certain qualified professionals, including retired medical professionals, that are not licensed under state law to administer vaccines to be able to do so with appropriate training in order to expand the number of qualified professionals able to administer the vaccine,” the statement added. President-elect Joe Biden discussed the state of the coronavirus pandemic in the US, saying the country remains in \"a very dark winter.\" \"Truthfully, we remain in a very dark winter. Infection rates are up we're up to 3,000 to 4,000 deaths a day as we approach a grim milestone of 400,000 deaths in America. That's staggering, to state the obvious,\" Biden said this afternoon in Wilmington, Delaware, during a Covid-19 news conference. \"[T]he vaccine rollout in the United States has been a dismal failure thus far.\" Some context: The official global death toll from the coronavirus pandemic surpassed 2 million on Friday, according to Johns Hopkins University. The tragic milestone came just over a year after the first Covid-19 death was reported in Wuhan, China. The US has recorded by far the highest total death toll in the world, followed by Brazil, India and Mexico. But the pandemic has reached every corner of the globe, and only a few tiny, isolated nations have reported no deaths. Watch: ##Hotspots## President-elect Joe Biden pledged to better communicate with states about vaccine distribution, in the hopes of having a little less confusion about how many doses are coming and when. In a fact sheet released as Biden relayed his vaccine plan Friday, the Biden transition team pledged to make sure as many doses of vaccine are made available as possible and as fast as possible. But clear communication is also needed. It’s an especially important promise after states discovered Friday that the Trump administration’s Operation Warp Speed was not holding millions of vaccine doses in reserve, as had been widely assumed.  Governors, immunization managers and other officials expressed anger and dismay when they learned the Trump’s administration’s comments about holding back doses to ensure everyone who got a first dose would get a second one did not mean those second doses actually existed. States were also confused about their initial allocations of vaccines in December. “To effectively plan and scale distribution, states and localities rely on both advanced understanding of their allocations and timely delivery of their ordered doses,” the transition team said in the fact sheet. \"Under President-elect Biden’s plan, the federal government will provide regular projections of the allocations states and localities will receive. The federal government will build on the operational plans in place to ensure the effective distribution, storage, and transit of vaccines to states, including support for maintaining or augmenting the vaccine-specific required cold chain.\"  The Biden team did not abandon the idea of holding some doses back in reserve. “President-elect Biden’s plan will release the ​vast majority​ of the vaccines when they are available, so ​more​ people can get vaccinated quickly​, while still retaining a ​small reserve​ for any ​unforeseen​ shortages or delays,” the fact sheet read. ##Vaccines##  President-elect Joe Biden plans to encourage states to vaccinate all Americans 65 and older in an effort to speed up the vaccination process. Biden is set to speak soon from Delaware on his plan to administer the vaccine.  “The process of establishing priority groups was driven by science, but the implementation has been too rigid and confusing. We now see doses of vaccines sitting in freezers unused while people who want the vaccine cannot get it,” the Biden transition team said in a fact sheet released Friday afternoon. The current Operation Warp Speed team under President Trump has also encouraged states to broaden their vaccination guidelines beyond what the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended. Only about 40% of doses of vaccine distributed have made it into people’s arms, according to the latest CDC data released Friday. On Friday, the CDC reported 31 million doses of vaccine have been distributed and 12 million doses have been given to people. Biden also said his administration would support the establishment of new, federally supported community vaccination centers across the country; pay states back for any use of the National Guard to roll out vaccines; set up mobile vaccination clinics; help make more vaccines available in pharmacies and work more closely with federally qualified health centers (FQHCs), which provide health care to 30 million people. “Given the critical role that these providers play in their communities, Biden will launch a new program to ensure that FQHCs can directly access vaccine supply where needed,” the transition team said. “At the same time, the Administration will encourage jurisdictions to engage and work closely with health centers in their community vaccination planning. And to ensure that health centers have the resources they need to successfully launch vaccination programs, President-elect Biden has called on Congress to provide additional funds to support community health centers, and HHS will launch a new program to provide guidance, technical assistance, and other resources to prepare and engage these providers nationwide,\" the statement continued.  ##Vaccines##  Rick Bright, a member of President-elect Joe Biden’s Covid-19 advisory board, said the administration plans to “push harder” on vaccinations as quickly as possible. “We want to open the floodgates on vaccination and make sure everyone who wants to get vaccinated can do so as quickly as possible,” Bright told CNN’s Brianna Keilar. “It's going to take a lot of effort, a lot of hard work, and we're going to do as much as we can as fast as we can.” Bright said the Biden administration plans to partner with states and strive for equity in vaccinations. Bright was ousted from his role leading the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority and filed an extensive whistleblower complaint alleging that his early warnings about the coronavirus were ignored.  Operation Warp Speed under the Trump administration has “been very chaotic, very disruptive, and certainly not transparent and not in a coordinated fashion from the federal to state level,” Bright added. “President-elect Biden is going to improve those coordination[s], improve that communication so we can improve the efficiency by which we’re going to vaccinate Americans.” ##Vaccines## The US has given more than 12 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines to 10.6 million people, according to data posted Friday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This breaks down to roughly 7 million doses from Pfizer/BioNTech and 5 million from Moderna. More than 1.6 million people have already received both doses of a vaccine, CDC said. The numbers indicate 900,000 more people have received a first dose of vaccine in the past day, and that just over 39% of vaccines distributed have gone into arms. The data, which are current as of 6 a.m. Friday, shows 31,161,075 doses distributed, 12,279,180 doses administered; 10,595,866 people who have gotten at least one dose; and 1,610,524 people who have gotten both doses. The total doses administered comprise 7,153,268 from Pfizer/BioNTech, 5,122,662 doses from Moderna, and 3,250 that are not identified. ##Vaccines## The threat of new, more contagious variants of the coronavirus means the US must double down on efforts to protect people until a large number can be vaccinated, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday.  A variant first identified in Britain known as B.1.1.7 is being found in the US as well, and modeling indicates it could worsen the already terrible spread of the virus across the country, the CDC researchers said. “Multiple lines of evidence indicate that B.1.1.7 is more efficiently transmitted than are other SARS-CoV-2 variants,” the CDC team wrote in the agency’s weekly report, the MMWR. “Variant B.1.1.7 has the potential to increase the U.S. pandemic trajectory in the coming months.” That means people need to do more to make sure everyone uses masks, tries harder to maintain social distancing and takes other measures known to reduce the risk of transmission. “Higher vaccination coverage might need to be achieved to protect the public,” the researchers added.  Plus, the CDC needs to do more to keep an eye out for new variants, and for the appearance of this one.  “CDC has also contracted with several large commercial clinical laboratories to rapidly sequence tens of thousands of SARS-CoV-2– positive specimens each month and has funded seven academic institutions to conduct genomic surveillance in partnership with public health agencies, thereby adding substantially to the availability of timely genomic surveillance data from across the United States,” the team wrote. “In addition to these national initiatives, many state and local public health agencies are sequencing SARS-CoV-2 to better understand local epidemiology and support public health response to the pandemic.”  It's not clear just how much more contagious any of the new variants are, the CDC noted. One variant first identified in South Africa and another one found in Japan among travelers from Brazil have yet to show up in US surveillance, the team said. B.1.1.7 has been found in at least 50 countries and in a dozen US states. ##Variant##  In wake of the Covid-19 pandemic claiming 2 million lives, the head of the United Nations has called for countries to \"commit now\" to share excess doses of vaccines. \"The world’s leading economies have a special responsibility. Yet today we are seeing a vaccine vacuum. Vaccines are reaching high income countries quickly, while the world’s poorest have none at all,\" UN Secretary General António Guterres said in a video message on Thursday.  \"Some countries are pursuing side deals, even procuring beyond need. Governments have a responsibility to protect their populations, but 'vaccinationalism' is self-defeating and will delay a global recovery,\" Guterres said. \"We need manufacturers to step up their commitment to work with the COVAX facility and countries around the world to ensure enough supply and fair distribution. We need countries to commit now to sharing excess doses of vaccines.\" Guterres specifically referred to COVAX, a World Health Organization global initiative to ensure rapid and equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines for all countries.  \"Sadly, the deadly impact of the pandemic has been made worse by the absence of a global coordinated effort. In the memory of those two million souls, the world must act with far greater solidarity,\" Guterres said in his video message.  \"Safe, effective COVID-19 vaccines are being rolled out — and the UN is supporting countries to mobilize the largest global immunization effort in history. We are committed to making sure that vaccines are seen as global public goods — people’s vaccines.\" ##Vaccines## More than two million people across the world have now lost their lives due to coronavirus. According to Johns Hopkins University, 2,000,905 people have died since the beginning of the pandemic.  The US leads with the most deaths followed by Brazil and India. ##Hotspots## Hopes of a surge in Covid-19 vaccine shipments under a new policy to release second doses held in reserve appear to be evaporating — with the revelation that those doses have already been distributed. A senior Trump administration official told CNN Friday that when the administration announced that it would be releasing reserved doses last week, many of those reserves had already been released into the system starting last year as production was ramping up.  The revelation seems to contradict what US Health and Human Services secretary announced on Jan. 12 at an Operation Warp Speed briefing, where he said the administration would be “releasing the entire supply for order by states, rather than holding second doses in reserve.” The official who spoke with CNN pushed back on a report that the second-dose supply was \"exhausted,\" instead characterizing the reserve as a rolling and replenished supply with new production.  The source emphasized that the supply would still benefit from those extra doses already in circulation — but acknowledged that this means there will not be a sudden surge in distribution numbers, as many had been led to believe.  Michael J. Pratt, the chief communications officer for Operation Warp Speed, also denied the notion the reserve was “exhausted” in a statement to CNN.  “This week, nearly 13 million total doses have been provided to states to order, millions more than other weeks, as the reserve of second doses is completely made available to order against, Pratt said. “States have yet to fully order against their ordering caps. As stated this week, we have now moved to the phase where the full amount released to OWS is being made available to order, first to cover second doses, second to provide additional first doses.”  The news shocked and angered officials in at least one state. “I am demanding answers from the Trump Administration. I am shocked and appalled that they have set an expectation on which they could not deliver, with such grave consequences,” Oregon Gov. Kate Brown tweeted Friday. “This is a deception on a national scale. Oregon’s seniors, teachers, all of us, were depending on the promise of Oregon’s share of the federal reserve of vaccines being released to us.” Oregon's health director wrote a letter to HHS Secretary Alex Azar Thursday, demanding he reconcile his statement last week about \"releasing the entire supply\" with this revelation. CNN obtained a letter written by Oregon Health Director Patrick Allen, in which he recounted a call with Brown and Operation Warp Speed Chief Operating Officer Gen. Gustave Perna on Thursday.  \"During that call, he informed us there is no reserve of doses, and we are already receiving the full allocation of vaccines,\" Allen wrote. \"If true, this is extremely disturbing, and puts our plans to expand eligibility at grave risk. Those plans were made on the basis of reliance on your statement about ‘releasing the entire supply’ you have in reserve. If this information is accurate, we will be unable to begin vaccinating our vulnerable seniors on January 23rd, as planned.\" CNN also contacted vaccine manufacturers Pfizer and Moderna, as well as Moderna’s distribution partner McKesson and did not get a response.  The revelation that second doses weren't strictly held in reserve was first reported by The Washington Post, which also reported that the Trump administration shifted its strategy to begin tapping into second doses late last year. “We are hearing there is not a stockpile of vaccine for second dose but that it was more of a ‘paper exercise,’” said Dr. Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. “The stockpile appears to be all on paper, they were tracking anticipated need but not actually holding back product.” The bottom line, Plescia said, is vaccine will remain scare for at least a few more weeks.  “I think the original message got lost in a lot of overpromising,” Plescia said. “Until there is a more robust supply we need to be clear with the public that opportunity to get the vaccine is limited.” CNN’s Jacqueline Howard, Nadia Kounang and John Bonifield contributed to this report. The United Kingdom will close all travel corridors from 4 a.m. local time Monday, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced Friday. Speaking at a news conference, Johnson stressed the only way to get into the country is by having a negative coronavirus test result. \"This means that if you come to this country, you must have proof of a negative Covid test that you've taken in the 72 hours before leaving. And you must have filled in your passenger locator form, and your airline will ask for proof of both before you take off,\" Johnson said. \"You may also be checked when you land and face substantial fines for refusing to comply, and upon arrival, you must then quarantine for 10 days, not leaving your home for any reason at all. Or take another test on day five and wait for proof of another negative result and we will be stepping up our enforcement, both at the border and in the country,\" Johnson added. The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has been briefed and reassured by Pfizer's CEO that \"all guaranteed doses of the first quarter will be delivered in the first quarter,\" she said Friday. In a statement released to CNN, Leyen said she \"immediately called the CEO of Pfizer, and he explained that there is a production delay in the next weeks,\" but reiterated that Pfizer would deliver the vaccines as agreed. \"He's personally on the case in reducing the delay period, and to make sure that they will catch up as soon as possible. That was very important to convey the message to him that we urgently need the guaranteed doses within the first quarter,\" Leyen concluded. Earlier Friday Pfizer announced shipments from its vaccine facility in Puurs, Belgium, will be temporarily reduced as it scales up to produce two billion Covid-19 vaccine doses in 2021.  The company said that in order to increase capacity to reach two billion, changes are needed to the process and facility, and additional regulatory approvals will be required.  ##Vaccines## Canada’s procurement minister called it \"unfortunate\" that Pfizer vaccine shipments would be delayed noting, \"such delays and issues are to be expected when global supply chains are stretched well beyond their limits.\" This comes as CNN reports Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine shipments will be temporarily reduced outside the US as manufacturing scales up.  Specifically Pfizer said on Friday that shipments from its vaccine facility in Puurs, Belgium, will be temporarily reduced as it scales up to produce two billion Covid-19 vaccine doses in 2021.   Canadian procurement minister Anita Anand says that she believes Canada, by the end of March, \"will be able to catch up such that we will be on track with the total committed doses for Q1.\" Speaking at a news conference Friday, Anand said: \"I understand from my discussions with Pfizer that all countries that are receiving doses from Pfizer’s European facility will be equitably treated in terms of the reductions.\" \n\"Pfizer believes that by the end of March we will be able to catch up, such that we will be on track with the total committed doses for Q1. This is unfortunate, however such delays and issues are to be expected when global supply chains are stretched well beyond their limits.\" Anand said Pfizer will have some \"temporary\" delays at some production lines at its facility in Puurs, Belgium, so that they could further expand manufacturing capacity. ##Vaccines## Pfizer said shipments from its vaccine facility in Puurs, Belgium, will be temporarily reduced as it scales up to produce two billion Covid-19 vaccine doses in 2021.  The company said that in order to increase capacity to reach two billion, changes are needed to the process and facility, and additional regulatory approvals will be required.  There will be fluctuations in orders and shipping scheduled from Pfizer’s facility in Puurs, Belgium, in late January and early February. The facility in Kalamazoo, Michigan, which supplies the United States, will not be impacted.  \"As part of the normal productivity improvements to increase capacity, we must make modifications to the process and facility that will require additional regulatory approvals. Although this will temporarily impact shipments in late January to early February, it will provide a significant increase in doses available for patients in late February and March,\" the company said in a statement released Friday.  On Tuesday Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said he was confident the company would be able to produce two billion doses in 2021, but noted the manufacturing challenges. \"You know, it's almost equally difficult to scale up manufacturing at that level so fast as it was to develop the vaccine and both teams can to rise to the occasion,\" Bourla said.  The company also said previously that because each vial can yield six doses rather than the expected five, it provides an additional 20% capacity.   ##Vaccines## The incoming Biden administration plans to retire the name for the coronavirus vaccine effort under President Trump – Operation Warp Speed – with a transition official for the incoming president telling CNN they are \"moving to a new phase\" of the coronavirus response. \"Operation Warp Speed was the Trump administration’s name for their response. We are structuring it differently and ours will have a new name,\" said an official, who added that many of the \"people who are working for Warp Speed who were critical to that operation will be critical to our response, too.\" Newly-appointed Dr. David Kessler will be part of that response, working as the chief scientific officer of the Covid-19 response out of the US Department of Health and Human Services under secretary-designee Xavier Becerra, the official said. His role will focus primarily on maximizing the supply of vaccines that are authorized or approved, and getting other vaccines online. The process of getting shots in arms will be run out of the White House and the team led by Jeff Zients, the official said. Gen. Gustave Perna, who is currently the chief operating officer of Operation Warp Speed, will stay on in the Biden administration, the official said, but under its \"new structure.\" ##Vaccines## Germany's Health Ministry said the country's federal and state governments ''noted with regret'' the ''very short notice and unexpected announcement by the [European] Commission and Pfizer'' to limit coronavirus vaccine deliveries temporarily due to modifications at the Puurs Pfizer plant in Belgium.  He made the comments in a statement issued Friday, saying, \"This is all the more so because the company had promised binding delivery dates until mid-February. The German federal and state governments expect the EU Commission to provide clarity and certainty for further deliveries and delivery dates as quickly as possible in the negotiations with Pfizer. In any case, it has been promised that the quantities announced for the first quarter will be delivered in full in the first quarter,” the statement concluded.  Nations across the EU are beginning to respond to the changes. Norway’s Director of Infection Prevention and Control at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Geir Bukholm, said in a statement: \"For Norway, this means that in week 3 we will receive 7,800 fewer doses than Pfizer had previously reported.\"  \"We were notified just before 10 a.m. [local] today. We were predicted to receive 43,875 vaccine doses from Pfizer in week 3. Now it looks like we will receive 36,075 doses. We have not yet sent out what we have kept in readiness for such cases and are now able to compensate for this reduction in deliveries with the emergency stockpile we have in Norway. Our current stockpile will be able to compensate for a reduction in the planned deliveries for a few weeks ahead, should the need arise,\" Bukholm added. Denmark's Statens Serum Institute also said that they have been told they will receive fewer vaccines. \"The pharmaceutical company Pfizer has today announced that it will deliver fewer covid-19 vaccines to Europe than planned in the coming weeks. It will also affect Pfizer's deliveries to Denmark. How much, however, is not yet known,\" the statement said. Denmark should have received 59,475 doses of covid-19 vaccine in week 3, it added. The Institute said it was notified on Friday morning that the change is due to a restructuring in production with a view to increasing capacity in the long term. Pfizer has indicated that they expect to have delivered the promised number of doses by the end of March 2021, the Danish statement said.  \"We are in ongoing dialogue with Pfizer about what it will actually mean for deliveries to Denmark, but we expect that this will mean that in the coming time we can vaccinate fewer than first assumed,\" director of Statens Serum Henrik Ullum Institute said. ##Vaccines## New York City added 4,650 confirmed and probable cases of Covid-19 and reported an 8.7% positivity rate on a seven-day average, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Friday. The city also added 286 new hospitalizations, the mayor tweeted \"Double down on what works this weekend,\" he added \n\"Stay home if you feel sick, avoid large gatherings, practice social distancing, and wear a mask.\" Remember: Positivity rate is the percentage of people who test positive for the virus of those overall who have been tested. So, as more and more people are being tested, the focus is shifting to the positivity rate —how many of those tested are actually infected. ##Hotspots## Despite hopes of widespread vaccinations this year, experts warned the start of 2021 would be a very rough time in this pandemic. It turns out the first two weeks have been abysmal: The US has shattered hospitalization, death and daily case records. Why is this happening? People are letting their guard down due to pandemic fatigue. And many of those who are sick of taking precautions are getting sick. Now that the weather is colder, more people are socializing indoors. And the coronavirus primarily spreads during close contact with others through respiratory droplets — produced when someone talks, coughs, sings or even breathes. Socializing indoors with anyone outside your bubble – even just one friend – is risky. Gathering with multiple friends indoors can be dangerous. \"If you go to a party with five or more people, almost certainly there's going to be somebody with Covid-19 at that party,\" said Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. One reason why the coronavirus spreads so easily is because people can be contagious without knowing they're infected – and can pass along the virus without looking or feeling sick. The CDC estimates more than 50% of all infections are transmitted from people who aren't showing symptoms. And just like doctors predicted, holiday travel and gatherings have triggered new waves of infections, hospitalizations and deaths across the country. Fallout from the holidays could still ripple across the United States for weeks to come. ##Hotspots## The Brazilian Air Force (FAB) landed in the Amazonian city of Manaus at 2:10 a.m. (3:10 a.m. ET) Friday, carrying six cylinders of liquid oxygen, totaling 9,300 kg of charge. The air force also flew out nine patients and five doctors from Manaus to Teresina. This comes after the Brazilian Health Minister Eduardo Pazuello warned Thursday that the healthcare system in Manaus is in \"collapse\" as Covid-19 cases surge. He said there was a low supply of oxygen and large lines to get into hospitals. ##Hotspots## Dr. Anthony Fauci said on Friday morning that \"it's quite feasible\" the United States can achieve President-elect Joe Biden's goal to distribute 100 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine in his first 100 days of office. Fauci is set to serve as Biden's chief medical adviser. \"You still optimistic that we can get 100 million doses in 100 days?\" NBC's Craig Melvin asked Fauci during an interview on the \"Today\" Show.  \"I really do think so,\" Fauci responded. \"We've discussed it with the Biden team, and we think it's quite feasible that we can do that. Right now, even now, we've gone from half a million a day to 750,000 a day. I believe strongly that it's doable — and if we do it, stay on target to get the overwhelming majority of the country vaccinated,\" said Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. \"If we get about 70% to 85% of the people in the country vaccinated, we likely will get to that umbrella of herd immunity,\" Fauci said. \"We can start approaching some form of normality, but it's really going to be dependent on the uptake of vaccines.\" ##Vaccines## President-elect Joe Biden will deliver remarks today on his plans to distribute the Covid-19 vaccine once he takes office next week. He's set to speak at 3:45 p.m. ET in Wilmington, Delaware.  His remarks come a day after he outlined a $1.9 trillion emergency legislative package to fund a nationwide vaccination effort and provide direct economic relief to Americans amid the coronavirus pandemic, telling Americans that \"the health of our nation is at stake.\" Last month, Biden he laid out his three-point plan to combat the coronavirus pandemic, including his plans to distribute 100 million vaccine shots in his initial 100 days in office. CNN reported last week that Biden will aim to release nearly every available dose of the coronavirus vaccine when he takes office, a break with the Trump administration's strategy of holding back half of US vaccine production to ensure second doses are available. Releasing nearly all vaccine doses on hand could quickly ratchet up the availability of coronavirus vaccines by allowing more people access to a first dose.  It could also be a risky strategy as both Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna's vaccines require two doses, administered at specific intervals, and vaccine manufacturing has not ramped up as rapidly as many experts had hoped. The Department of Health and Human Services then announced sweeping changes Tuesday in vaccine rollout guidelines in an effort to boost the lagging number of vaccinations in the first month — effectively adopting the approach proposed by Biden's incoming administration. ##Vaccines## It still remains unclear for how long someone who has recovered from Covid-19 might be protected from getting reinfected and whether they can still carry the virus and spread it to others, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on Friday morning.  \"We do not know the duration of the durability of protection from yourself to get reinfected as well as spreading to others,\" Fauci said in an interview with NBC's Craig Melvin on the \"Today\" show.  He added: \"We are doing studies to answer those kinds of questions.\" Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel will meet earlier than planned with the country's 16 regional leaders to discuss ramping up coronavirus restrictions, Merkel's spokesman Steffen Seibert announced on Friday, as the virus surges across the country.  ''New infection cases are too high,'' Seibert said, adding that Germany is on high alert for new, more contagious mutations of the virus. ''The German government is observing these developments very carefully and is taking this seriously,” he added. Merkel was set to meet with the regional leaders on January 25. Germany on Friday surpassed two million coronavirus cases after adding 22,368 new coronavirus infections within 24 hours, bringing the total number of reported infections to 2,000,958, the country's disease and control agency, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) said.  On Thursday RKI chief Lothar Wieler said that the current lockdown in place is ''not as effective as in spring,'' urging that more people should work from home and adding that the current lockdown needed to be tightened. Germany entered a partial national lockdown in November but tightened curbs in mid- December, closing schools and nurseries as well as non-essential shops. The lockdown is currently in place until the end of January.  ##Hotspots## The executive director of the European Medicines Agency, Emer Cooke, has defended the organization against “criticism of perceived delays” in authorizing Covid-19 vaccines.  “We constantly hear criticism about perceived delays in the EU, particularly after the emergency use authorizations that were granted in the UK and US. There is no European provision for such emergency approvals,” the head of the regulatory body said, while speaking at an Institute of International and European Affairs webinar event on Friday.  The EU faced extensive criticism for its authorization speed in December, after the UK became the first nation to approve a Covid-19 vaccine -- the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine -- on December 2, which the EMA did not approve until December 21.  Cooke emphasised the EMA was applying “the same robust authorization standards that we would for any vaccine” during its Covid-19 vaccine review process.  To date, two Covid-19 vaccines have been authorized for use in the EU: the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine on 21 December 2020 and the Moderna vaccine on 6 January 2021. The EMA received an application for conditional marketing authorization for the Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine on Tuesday and the EMA is “hoping we can conclude the evaluation by the end of January,” according to Cooke.  When asked about reports that drug maker Johnson and Johnson will seek regulatory approval for its Covid-19 vaccine in February, Cooke responded that she expects the company “to seek approval when they’re ready to seek approval… we hope it to come in February but whether I could confirm that’s the case, I’m afraid I’m not in a position to do so.” ##Vaccines## Oxygen supplies are running short and hundreds of patients are waiting for beds, as hospitals in Brazil's largest state, Amazonas, face a crisis amid surging coronavirus infections,  Brazilian Health Minister Eduardo Pazuello described the healthcare system in the state capital, Manaus, as being in \"collapse\" during a Facebook live with President Jair Bolsonaro on Thursday. \"I would say yes, there is a collapse in healthcare in Manaus. The line to get a hospital bed has grown a lot, today we have about 480 people waiting in line. And the reality is that there is a lower supply of oxygen -- not an interruption, but a lower supply of oxygen,\" he said. The latest surge in cases in Amazonas may be fueled by a new variant of the virus recently identified in Brazil. Manaus, globally known as the gateway to the Amazon region, also suffered badly in the first wave of the pandemic. Brazil's Covid-19 death toll is the second highest in the world, behind only that of the United States. According to data from Johns Hopkins University, there have been more than 207,000 deaths from Covid-19 in Brazil and more than 8.3 million reported cases of coronavirus.

That means almost half -- 44 percent -- of all the Covid cases we've ever reported have been reported in the last 14 days. It means that one in 67 people in this country have been notified Covid positive in the last 14 days,\" Nolan told a briefing.  Dr. Ronan Glynn, deputy chief medical officer for Ireland’s Department of Health, warned at the briefing that \"there are going to be difficult days and weeks ahead as we report these numbers and unfortunately all of that is unquestionably going to translate into significant levels of mortality in the days and weeks to come”.  In a statement from Ireland’s Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) on Thursday, Nolan also said that “from an epidemiological perspective, what we are seeing in this wave is different to what we have seen since springtime, and perhaps worse”.  “The penetration of the virus throughout all ages of the population is a particular cause for serious concern,” he added. When Ireland came out of a strict six-week lockdown in December it had one of the lowest levels of Covid-19 cases in Europe. Since then, the situation has dramatically unraveled. The country recorded the highest infection rate in the world last week, according to Our World in Data, an online scientific publication based at the University of Oxford.  The seasonality of the virus, the presence of the more transmissible UK variant, and households mixing over the holidays all contributed to the surge, according to a spokesperson from Prime Minister Micheál Martin's office. On Thursday, the country's Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) reported 28 additional deaths related to COVID-19 and 3,955 new confirmed cases.

Here are the highest country totals from Europe as a whole: United Kingdom: 2,918,252 people have received their first dose of the vaccine, with many also receiving a second, according to government data. Italy: 972,099 total vaccinations have been given, according to Health ministry data.  Germany: 842,455 people have received the vaccine, which represents about 1% of the country's population, according to latest data from the Robert Koch Institute. Spain: 676,186 people have received the first dose, according to Spanish Health Ministry data. Poland: 410,480 vaccinations have been given, according to the latest Polish government data. France: 318,216 people have received the shot since the vaccine rollout began on December 27, according to the country's Health Ministry. ##Vaccines## During the first peak of the pandemic in April 2020 1.6 billion students were out of school  and almost 700 million remained out as the year drew to a close, according to the World Bank. It may take years for the full impact of these months of missed schooling to be known, so what can history tell us about the long-term effects of disruptions to education? Nothing can be directly compared to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, said Alberto Posso, professor of economics at RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia, but some parallels can be drawn.  \"As far as learning from history goes, I think the value is in the potential warning signs these things can give us,\" he said. Posso looked at examples including the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, teacher strikes in Argentina in the 1980s and World War II in a piece for The Conversation. Perhaps the most striking data came from a paper assessing the long-term education cost of World War II for children who were 10 years old during the conflict in Germany and Austria -- both participants in the war -- and comparable children in Switzerland and Sweden, countries that remained officially neutral. The authors of the 2004 paper, Andrea Ichino and Rudolf Winter-Ebmer, concluded that \"individuals experienced a sizable earnings loss some 40 years after the war, which can be attributed to the educational loss caused by the conflict.\" \"Austrian children missed around 20% of classes during the war and their earnings dropped by around 3%. German children lost around 25% of classes and had earnings dropped by around 5%,\" Posso told CNN, citing their findings.

Those concerned will also have to pledge to self-isolate for seven days once they arrive in France and to repeat a second PCR test afterwards.”  The country has just extended its national curfew from 6 pm until 6 am in a bid to fight Covid-19 and “avoid harsher measures.” France has reported more than 2.9 million cases and more than 69,000 deaths, according to John Hopkins University. ##Hotspots## China's Foreign Ministry said one member of the World Health Organization task force will not be allowed to enter the country after testing positive for coronavirus antibodies. Fifteen WHO experts were set to arrive in the central Chinese city of Wuhan Thursday to investigate the origins of the novel coronavirus, but two were held back in Singapore after testing positive for Covid-19 IgM antibodies. Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said Friday that after a second round of tests, one would be allowed to enter, but one would not be granted entry.  \"Among the 15 members of the WHO expert group, there was one expert from the UK and one Sudanese expert from Qatar who tested positive for the IgM serum antibody in Singapore airport during the transit,\" Zhao said.  The British expert had a negative result in the second test, while the Qatari expert tested positive again, Zhao explained. \"We have agreed that the British expert will come to China, and we will continue to maintain communication with WHO on related matters and make joint efforts to cooperate on tracing the origin of the virus.\" Regulations require passengers from Singapore to China to complete a nucleic acid test, a serum test, and for IgM anti-bodies, and then obtain the double-negative test results within two days before boarding, Zhao said.  The \"double-negative\" test requirement was implemented by China in November of last year. What about the other members? The 13 members of the World Health Organization that arrived in Wuhan Thursday have been admitted to a quarantine hotel.  \"The aim is to ensure the safety of epidemic prevention and to guarantee the orderly exchange of Chinese and foreign personnel,\" the Foreign Ministry spokesman said. \n\"It is to maintain China’s hard-earned domestic epidemic prevention and control achievements. It also helps minimize the risk of cross-infection for those coming to China and maintain the health and safety of everyone.\" ##Restrictions## At the current rate of daily fatalities, the US death toll from the Covid-19 pandemic may reach 400,000 before President-elect Joe Biden is sworn in on Wednesday. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's ensemble projections estimate 403,000 total Covid-19 deaths in the US by the third week of January. This comes as hospitals and health care systems scramble to keep up with the influx of new patients. Currently, more than 128,000 people are hospitalized in the US, according to the COVID Tracking Project. In the US, 388,533 people have died from Covid-19 since the beginning of the pandemic. Thursday's figures showed 229,386 new cases and 3,769 new deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data. The City of Laredo, Texas, tweeted an \"emergency message\" Thursday saying their medical professionals are overwhelmed with the surge in Covid-19 cases. \"Our medical professionals are overwhelmed with the surge in COVID-19 cases. Lives are at stake, and we are asking you to stay home unless it's absolutely necessary ... save a life,\" the tweet said. As frontline workers struggle to keep patients alive and hospital ICU wings operational, the success of the vaccine rollout remains inconsistent. Read the full story: ##Hotspots## China continues to record an increasing number of new daily Covid-19 infections, with the country's National Health Commission reporting 144 new cases for Thursday. Of those cases, 135 were locally transmitted: 90 in Hebei province\n43 in Heilongjiang province\n1 in Guangxi autonomous region\n1 in Shaanxi province China also reported 66 asymptomatic cases, of which 55 were locally transmitted. Chinese health officials record asymptomatic cases separately. ##Hotspots## The United States reported 229,386 new coronavirus cases and 3,769 additional deaths on Thursday, according to Johns Hopkins University's tally. JHU's Covid-19 dashboard shows the nationwide totals now stand at 23,307,461 confirmed infections and 388,540 fatalities. The totals include cases from all 50 states, the District of Columbia and other US territories, as well as repatriated cases.   Vaccines: At least 30,628,175 vaccine doses have been distributed and at least 11,148,991 shots administered across the US, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Track the US cases: ##Hotspots## Germany has now reported more than 2 million coronavirus cases, becoming the 10th country to do so, according to Johns Hopkins University data.  The country reported 22,368 new infections in the past day, bringing the total number of infections to 2,000,958, the country's disease control agency, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) said Friday.   The country also reported 1,113 new fatalities related to Covid-19, raising the overall death toll to 44,994, according to RKI data.   The number of coronavirus deaths in Germany is \"very worrying,'' RKI head Lothar Wieler said Thursday.\nNew coronavirus infections ''must reduce massively,'' Wieler told journalists in Berlin, adding that ''intensive care units have never been as exhausted as in recent days.”  Ten of Germany's 16 federal states have now reached 85% capacity in their intensive care units, Wieler warned.  The RKI chief said the current lockdown in place is \"not as effective as in spring.\" He called on German citizens to ''stay at home whenever possible,\" and urged employers to allow employees to work from home during the pandemic.  Germany has vaccinated more than 842,000 people, about 1% of its population, according to RKI data. ##Hotspots## The number of new skyscrapers built globally dropped more than 20% in 2020, according to data released this week by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH). Last year saw the completion of 106 new buildings measuring 200 meters (656 feet) or above, down from 133 in 2019 -- and the lowest total since 2014. The CTBUH largely attributed the slowdown to Covid-19, as projects around the world \"ground to a halt\" amid restrictions on assembly, said its annual report. Though the group was only able to find nine projects directly blaming delays on the pandemic, it assumed that \"many more\" had \"encountered difficulties\" as a consequence. China, which traditionally dominates global high-rise construction, experienced another comparatively slow year. Its annual total of 56 new 200-meter-plus buildings was down only one from 2019, though this follows a drop of almost 40% the year prior. Read the full story: United States Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar has praised the insight of a top Centers for Disease Control and Prevention official who was muzzled for months as the coronavirus pandemic raged.  Dr. Nancy Messonnier, who heads the CDC’s respiratory diseases branch and who has for years been a regular, trusted voice for reporters covering the center, disappeared from public view after she warned about the potential spread of coronavirus in February. Sources have told CNN and others it was because her frank and truthful statements upset President Donald Trump. But in his remarks summing up the pandemic to the conservative Heritage Foundation Thursday, Azar claimed he valued Messonnier’s advice and knowledge and said it showed HHS followed science in what the American public was told about the virus. Azar also indicated he followed the advice of CDC chief Dr. Robert Redfield, who continued to appear in public, and Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. He also claimed to value the counsel of CDC’s Dr. Anne Schuchat, another official who disappeared from public view for months on end. \"As the virus spread around the world, and began to take a foothold here in the United States, we were clear with the American people about what we knew as soon as we knew it,\" Azar said. \"Throughout January and February, there was no immediate threat to the general American public. But, as Dr. Messonnier said on January 31, we were, quote, 'preparing as if this were the next pandemic but hopefully, still that is not and will not be the case.'” At the time, Azar was telling the public that coronavirus, which has now killed more than 388,000 Americans, was no serious threat. On Thursday, Azar went on to praise Messonnier for giving warnings he did not give. “We may remember that on February 25 in the daily CDC telebriefing. Dr. Nancy Messonnier noted that community mitigation measures were in our future, and would include steps like school closures,” Azar said. “Certainly the stock market took notice. This was exactly what the taskforce had determined on February 21, but she got a little ahead of the briefing of the President and the official announcement. But she and we were correct.” ##Hotspots## The Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles will launch as a mass vaccination site starting Friday morning, the city's Mayor Eric Garcetti announced at a news conference Thursday. The site, which the mayor referred to as the “biggest vaccination site in the country,” will have the capacity to vaccinate 12,000 people each day. A whole workforce has been deployed to administer the vaccines, according to Garcetti. “This vaccine is safe, this vaccine is safe,” he repeatedly emphasized, as he urged residents to get the vaccine once they are eligible. \n“It’s your civic duty when it’s your turn to get that vaccine. It’s an act of love for your fellow citizen because it’s going to save someone’s life or many people’s lives, and it’s a forward step to reopening our schools and our economy.” Who can get the vaccine: In Los Angeles County, the vaccine is currently only available to healthcare workers and seniors living in senior homes and skilled nursing facilities. While the county has approximately 1 million healthcare workers, Garcetti said about half of them have not yet received the vaccine.  “The bottom line is, we don’t have enough vaccines,” Garcetti said.  He also said that some sites may be reserving their allocation of vaccines to administer the second dose for their healthcare workers. With the opening of Dodger Stadium and five additional vaccination sites from the county, Garcetti said he expects hundreds of thousands to be vaccinated each week. What's going on in Los Angeles County: The county has a reported a total of 975,299 coronavirus cases and 13,234 deaths. Hospitalizations in the county continue to overwhelm hospitals and healthcare workers, and there are currently 7,906 people being treated in the hospital with coronavirus -- 21% of them in the intensive care unit.  Garcetti said that while there are early signs showing that hospitalizations in the county may be stabilizing, it is not “even close to being out of the woods.” ##Hotspots##  ##Vaccines## Brazilian Health Minister Eduardo Pazuello said that the healthcare system in the hard-hit Amazonian city of Manaus is in “collapse” during a Facebook live broadcast with President Jair Bolsonaro on Thursday. “I would say, yes, there is a collapse in healthcare in Manaus. The line to get a hospital bed has grown a lot, today we have about 480 people waiting in line. And the reality is that there is a lower supply of oxygen -- not an interruption, but a lower supply of oxygen,” he said. Pazuello also said Brazil -- which has yet to commence a vaccination campaign even though its Covid-19 death toll is the second highest in the world, behind only the United States -- will begin to vaccinate people in January, though he did not specify a date. “In January we will start vaccinating. In the beginning with 2, 6, or 8 million doses. … And in February, we will have mass production, and our National Vaccination Program, which we’ve been doing for 45 years, will get ahead of everyone in the whole world, including the United States.” The Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (ANVISA) will meet on Sunday, Jan. 17 to decide whether to give emergency approvals to the Oxford/AstraZeneca and the Sinovac vaccine, according to state-run news agency Agencia Brasil. Venezuela offers to send oxygen: Venezuela has offered to send oxygen tanks to Amazonas state, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza said Thursday. Arreaza said on Twitter that he made the offer during a call with Amazonas Gov. Wilson Lima, and added: “Latin American solidarity above all!” ##Hotspots##  ##Vaccines## President-elect Joe Biden on Thursday evening outlined a $1.9 trillion emergency legislative package to fund a nationwide vaccination effort and provide direct economic relief to Americans amid the coronavirus pandemic, telling Americans that \"the health of our nation is at stake.\" \"There is real pain overwhelming the real economy -- one where people rely on paychecks, not their investments, to pay for their bills and their meals and their children's needs,\" Biden said in a speech in Wilmington, Delaware, in which he took aim at the nation's searing income inequality. He did not detail how he plans to move his massive proposal through a Congress where Democrats will have narrow House and Senate majorities, though both congressional Democratic leaders pledged to shepherd Biden's vision into law. Instead, Biden spoke about the economic and health threat of the pandemic, calling them \"once-in-several-generations\" crises, and cast delivering economic relief and rapidly vaccinating Americans as urgent challenges. \"In this pandemic in America, we cannot let people go hungry. We cannot let people get evicted. We cannot let nurses, educators and others lose their jobs when we so badly need them. We must act now and act decisively,\" Biden said. The American Rescue Plan will include allocating more than $400 billion toward addressing the Covid-19 pandemic, including $160 billion in funding to execute a national vaccination program, expand testing and mobilize a public health jobs program, among other measures. His proposal includes $1,400 stimulus checks for Americans and extending and expanding unemployment benefits, including a $400 weekly unemployment insurance supplement, through September. Read more about the package: ##Stimulus## The UK has decided to ban arrivals from multiple Latin American countries “following evidence of a new variant in Brazil,” British Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said Thursday on Twitter.  Starting Friday at 4 a.m. local time, arrivals to the UK will be banned from Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Cape Verde, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay and Venezuela.  “Travel from Portugal to the UK will also be suspended given its strong travel links with Brazil -- acting as another way to reduce the risk of importing infections,” Shapps said, adding that hauliers transporting essential goods were exempt.  He added that these measures would not apply to British and Irish citizens and other nationals who have UK residence rights, but arriving passengers would have to quarantine for 10 days. All parts of the UK are currently under strict lockdown with international travel only allowed for a limited number of reasons. The country is in the midst of its worst wave of Covid-19 infections with record daily deaths reported on Wednesday. ##Variant## More than 20,000 citizens from 12 villages in the Gaocheng District of the Chinese city of Shijiazhuang have been relocated to quarantine sites as a preventative measure against Covid-19, according to Chinese state media. State broadcaster CGTN cited China's National Health Commission (NHC) official Tong Zhaohui saying the new quarantine sites aim to avoid new infections emerging from contact between people with and without the virus. Hebei Province, of which Shijiazhuang is the capital, has been at the center of China’s most recent outbreak of the pandemic. The NHC reported 138 new Covid-19 infections on Wednesday, including 14 imported cases. Of the 124 locally transmitted cases, 81 cases are from Hebei province. Hebei’s vice governor Xu Jianpei announced on Tuesday that a second round of mass testing programs would begin in the cities of Shijiazhuang, Xingtai and Langfang. The province’s first round of testing of 17 million people ended on Sunday. Construction has also started on a centralized medical center in Shijiazhuang. It’s set to cover 33 hectares and will have 3,000 makeshift wards, CGTN reported. On Wednesday one person was reported to have died from the virus in Hebei province, the first fatality in China for 242 days. ##Restrictions## People who have been infected with Covid-19 are likely to be protected against catching it again for at least five months, according to a new study led by Public Health England (PHE). The study -- which has not yet been peer reviewed -- found that past infection was linked to an 83% lower risk of reinfection, compared to people who have not been infected before. But researchers warned that the protection was not absolute, meaning some people do catch the virus again, and that it was unclear how long any immunity lasts. It is also possible that those who have a degree of immunity against the virus may still be able to carry the virus in their nose or throat and therefore transmit it to others. \"We now know that most of those who have had the virus, and developed antibodies, are protected from reinfection, but this is not total and we do not yet know how long protection lasts,\" Susan Hopkins, senior medical adviser at PHE and co-leader of the study, said in a statement.\n\"Even if you believe you already had the disease and are protected, you can be reassured it is highly unlikely you will develop severe infections. But there is still a risk you could acquire an infection and transmit (it) to others,\" Hopkins said.
