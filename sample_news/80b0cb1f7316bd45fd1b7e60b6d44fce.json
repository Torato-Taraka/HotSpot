Critics have dismissed that as nonsense and say Duterte is gambling with Philippine sovereignty and getting little from Beijing in return.Xinhua’s report on the meeting made no mention of the ruling.It said Xi urged the two sides to “set aside disputes, eliminate external interference, and concentrate on conducting cooperation, making pragmatic efforts and seeking development”.“As long as the two sides handle the South China Sea issue properly, the atmosphere of bilateral ties will be sound, the foundation of the relationship will be stable, and regional peace and stability will have an important guarantee,” it quoted Xi as saying.The two sides could take a “bigger step” in the joint development of offshore oil and gas, it quoted Xi as saying.That could be extremely complex and sensitive, however, as both countries claim jurisdiction over the Reed Bank, the main site of the oil and gas reserves, despite the arbitration award declaring that Manila had sovereign rights to exploit them.The Philippines is proposing a 60-40 sharing arrangement in its favor.China’s claims in the South China Sea, through which more than $3 trillion in ship-borne trade passes each year, are contested by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "URL": "https://mb.com.ph/2019/08/30/chinas-xi-sees-bigger-role-for-joint-development-of-offshore-oil-gas-with-philippines/", "MainKeyWord": "China", "AdditionalKeyWord": "Philippines", "Source": "MB"}
