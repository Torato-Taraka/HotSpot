Oman has very much less petroleum.We have always believed that the raging flashpoint in the South China Sea, with conflicting sovereignty claims, may be settled by temporarily shelving the issue of sovereignty.We envision joint oil/gas exploration and joint development with an equitable sharing of production and profits; designate “fishing corridors”; convert existing long-standing or newly-built bases into joint tourism sites, weather stations, logistical ports facilities, bases for joint seismic and oil exploration and mining in the South China Sea; eventually demilitarize the disputed islands through the phased withdrawal of armed garrisons; and covert the zone of conflict into a zone of peace, friendship, cooperation, and development.We believe this is the most realistic, most common-sensical solution to the problem of the Spratlys among the so-called frontline states of the Philippines, China, and Vietnam, which should be joined by Malaysia, Brunei, and Taiwan.This could also be the solution to the perilous problem between China and Japan in the Senkaku or Diaoyu Straits in the East China Sea.\nOf course, it is easier said than done but we should consider the most practical, most sensible, and most realistic win-win compromises necessary for the geo-political settlements in the South China Sea conflict.In Western Europe, the North Sea powers, including the United Kingdom, Norway, and Germany, undertook a peaceful median line partition of the North Sea. In the Norwegian oilfield of Ekofisk, the oil flows to Teesside in England and Stavanger in Norway and the gas to Bremen, Germany, the result of peaceful, friendly dialogue and practical geo-political settlement.\nWe remember leaving behind our son Joey III and daughter Vivian, who were both under ten years old then, in Stavanger in Norway when we boarded a helicopter, accompanied by our nephew Ramon San Jose III, to visit the petroleum operations in the North Sea in the 1970s. We were then president of the Petroleum Association of the Philippines.The North Sea agreement among the United Kingdom, Norway, and Germany is a classic example of how we should resolve the problem in the South China Sea where the Philippines, China, and Vietnam can and should enter into a consortium and share the cost and benefits of stratigraphic drilling and production and where American and European participation can even be considered.What is important is that the parties must agree on a location of the drilling site whether on the Philippine side, China side, or Vietnam side so that the sharing of petroleum discovery can be distributed accordingly, including the engagement of American or European participants in the event that the consortium engages a Western drillship or a designated common consortium operator.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "URL": "https://mb.com.ph/2020/07/18/maritime-dispute-not-sum-total-of-philippines-china-relationship-temporarily-bypass-contentious-issues-and-concentrate-on-joint-projects-in-west-philippine-sea/", "MainKeyWord": "China", "AdditionalKeyWord": "Philippines", "Source": "MB"}
