Vietnam and the Philippines also have competing claims on the reef.“It’s very likely that China will send an oil rig to drill in the area where the Haiyang Dizhi 8 had conducted seismic surveys in Vietnam’s exclusive economic zone,” Hop said.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "URL": "https://mb.com.ph/2019/10/24/chinese-ship-heads-away-from-vietnam-after-disputed-surveys-in-south-china-sea/", "MainKeyWord": "China", "AdditionalKeyWord": "viet Nam", "Source": "MB"}
