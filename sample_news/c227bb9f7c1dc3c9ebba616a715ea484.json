Since taking office, he has vowed to renegotiate terms even as construction work continued.But in a surprise move this week, the finance ministry, under Mahathir’s orders, called a halt to work on three projects: the $20-billion East Coast Railway Link (ECRL) and two pipeline projects worth $2.3 billion.The 688-km (428-mile) ECRL will connect the South China Sea off the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia with the strategic shipping routes of the Straits of Malacca to the west.The other two projects are a petroleum pipeline stretching 600 km (373 miles) along the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia and a 662-km (411-mile) gas pipeline in Sabah, the Malaysian state on the island of Borneo.Chinese state-owned firms are involved in all three projects.“The decisions are solely directed toward the related contractors, relating to the provisions mentioned in the agreements, and not at any particular country,” the finance ministry said in a statement on Thursday.“DO NOT WANT TO BE INDEBTED TO CHINA”Calling the halt was part of a negotiation strategy ahead of high-level government talks, said two other sources familiar with the government’s thinking, since the Belt and Road status of the ECRL makes a successful outcome critical for the Chinese.“It’s sending a message to the Chinese,” said one of the sources, a senior finance ministry official. “They don’t want a failure to taint their name.”Malaysia’s Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng has said Najib’s government understated the true cost of the ECRL, which was 50 percent higher, at $20 billion, than the earlier estimate.Organized before his election victory, Mahathir’s first overseas visit as prime minister, to Japan last month, was nonetheless seen as a signal he would look beyond China for key foreign investment.“We will be friendly with China, but we do not want to be indebted to China,” he said in Tokyo.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "URL": "https://mb.com.ph/2018/07/06/malaysias-mahathir-to-visit-china-after-putting-20-billion-of-projects-on-ice-sources/", "MainKeyWord": "China", "AdditionalKeyWord": "Malaysia", "Source": "MB"}
