{"Type": "article", "Time": "2020-07-22", "Headline": "July 23 coronavirus news", "Text": "Ninety-six employees at a seafood processing plant in Seward, Alaska have tested positive for Covid-19, according to the Alaska Department of Health and Social Services. The company, OBI Seafoods, said most of the employees have not experienced any Covid-19 symptoms and none have been hospitalized, the press release said. The infected employees were taken to Anchorage to isolate where they will be provided medical care, monitoring, security and housing. Employees who tested negative will be placed under quarantine in Seward and will be monitored and tested every three days until no additional positive cases are identified. The first case was discovered after a plant employee, who had sought medical care for a non-Covid 19 related issue, tested positive for the virus. The company then tested all 262 plant employees, implemented isolation protocols and began contact tracing.  CNN has reached out to OBI Seafoods for comment. A total of 300 new novel coronavirus cases have been detected in the southeastern Australian state of Victoria, the state's premier announced Friday. Of the 300 cases, only 51 are from a known source with connections to previous cases.  Premier Daniel Andrews told reporters that health authorities had struggled to conduct contact tracing interviews with around 25% of people who had tested positive, as they were unable to contact them.  To ensure that contact tracing interviews are conducted on the same day, twenty-eight teams from the Australian Defense Force will be dispatched to go from door-to-door with health officials, Andrews said. Before the military support teams are sent to individual homes, Andrews said that authorities would attempt to telephone first. If the call goes unanswered then they will visit the home.  Andrews warned that if the person was not at home when teams arrived, they could be subject to fines for breaching lockdown orders. The military personnel who have been sent to Victoria State has been bolstered to 1400. Counties that are predominantly Latino account for a disproportionate number of Covid-19 cases in most regions of the United States, with the exception of the South, and structural racism is in part to blame, according to a new study. In general, the Latino/Hispanic community has been disproportionately impacted by Covid-19. While Latinos account for 18% of the US population, in June the community accounted for one in three of all confirmed Covid-19 cases in the US.  Latinos also had among the highest age-adjusted rates of Covid-19 related hospitalizations and in June made up one in five of all confirmed Covid-19 deaths.  For the study published Thursday in the Annals of Epidemiology, researchers looked at data on Covid-19 cases in deaths at the county level. In the Northeast, majority Latino counties have more than 63% of coronavirus cases and more than 66% of the deaths. In the Midwest, these counties have more than 31% of the cases and more than 22% of the deaths. In the West it’s more than 75% of the cases and more than 73% of the deaths.   These numbers are likely an undercount, the researchers said, because Latino communities, particularly in low-income areas, are less likely to have access to Covid-19 testing.  “We found that crowded housing, air pollution, jobs in the meatpacking and poultry industry and other factors put Latinos at high risk of COVID-19 infections and death,” said a lead author of the study, Carlos Rodriguez-Diaz, an associate professor of prevention and community health at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. Rodriguez-Diaz hopes that public health leaders can use this work to inform decisions about which areas need to increase access to testing and access to language-appropriate education materials about Covid-19. The study also argues that all states need to expand Medicaid. Mexico’s health ministry reported a new daily record in coronavirus cases Thursday, logging 8,438 new confirmed infections in 24 hours. The ministry also said there had been 718 new deaths from the virus.  The country’s total number of confirmed coronavirus infections is now 370,712, while the death tolls stands at 41,908, according to the ministry. Mexico has the world’s fourth highest Covid-19 death toll, trailing the United States, Brazil and the United Kingdom, according to Johns Hopkins University. Americans should have clamped down on public gatherings instead of opening up, global philanthropist and coronavirus vaccine funder Bill Gates said Thursday on CNN’s Global Town Hall Coronavirus: Facts and Fears. “There's certainly some activities that the benefit they provide versus the risk of infection means they probably shouldn't be allowed for the rest of this year and until the numbers get way, way down,” Gates said.  Going to bars is one of those activities, he said. “I joke if people went into bars and they didn’t talk, it’d be okay to just sit quietly and drink. But, you know, restaurants, public gatherings, we should have clamped down on those even more at the time we opened them up,” said Gates.\n“And people said hey, your cases are increasing so you can't be opening up and people hope that we get away with that because people like to come out, but we didn't. In most parts of the country we didn't get away with it.” Coronavirus cases are surging across parts of the United States and hundreds of people are now dying again every day from the deadly virus. When asked what he learned from the Covid-19 outbreak, philanthropist Bill Gates said that testing needs to be \"10 times faster.\" Gates said he plans to invest in testing for future pandemics. \"We will invest — and I know the US government and other governments will — in having vaccine platforms that get us very rapid results. Likewise, next time we'll be able to scale up diagnostics 10 times faster than this time. And antivirals and antibodies, we'll be able to do those more quickly,\" he said. Gates continued: \"It's sad that it took this, you know, these deaths, the economic pain, the divisiveness that we still aren't sure how quickly it will end, but they are indeed a priority and the potential to solve these things is absolutely there. That's why I was excited in 2015 that even if tens of billions had gone into these things, this is exactly the kind of thing that could have been stopped before it did significant damage.\" Watch: ##Town Hall## Despite what hordes of conspiracy theorists online may believe, Bill Gates, one of the world's most magnanimous philanthropists, is not responsible for causing the coronavirus pandemic, he said today. Gates was specifically asked on CNN's global coronavirus town hall about the fringe group known as QAnon, which claims that dozens of politicians and A-list celebrities work in tandem with governments around the globe to engage in child sex abuse, among other theories. Followers also believe there is a \"deep state\" effort to annihilate President Trump. \"The culmination of having social media spreading things that are very titillating, to have this pandemic where people are uncertain and they prefer to have a simple explanation, it's meant that these things are really millions of messages a day, and people like myself and Dr. [Anthony] Fauci have become the target,\" Gates said. \"And so I hope the conspiracy stuff dies down. It's really, the numbers kind of blow my mind. And it's not just the fringe people that you would normally think of.\" Earlier this week: Twitter removed thousands of accounts linked to QAnon which has become notorious for spreading conspiracy theories and disinformation online. \"We've been clear that we will take strong enforcement action on behavior that has the potential to lead to offline harm,\" Twitter's safety team said late Tuesday in a tweet. \"In line with this approach, this week we are taking further action on so-called 'QAnon' activity across the service.\" More than 7,000 accounts have been removed in the last several weeks, according to Twitter. It also expects that additional actions it is taking to limit the reach of QAnon activity on its platform could affect 150,000 accounts worldwide. QAnon began as a single conspiracy theory. But its followers now act more like a virtual cult, largely adoring and believing whatever disinformation the conspiracy community spins up. CNN's Rishi Iyengar contributed to this report. Watch: ##Town Hall## Early data on a coronavirus vaccine shows that it will take more than one dose to protect people from the virus, Microsoft founder and philanthropist Bill Gates told CNN tonight. Gates, who along with his wife Melinda, runs the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation which  pledged up to $100 million in February to help contain the coronavirus outbreak around the world. These funds have also been used to help find a vaccine for the virus, limit its spread and improve the detection and treatment of patients. \"None of the candidates that we have much data on look like they'll work with a single dose. So these are all multi-dose vaccines. If we look at the elderly, some of the constructs might require more than two doses to get the protection we want,\" Gates said during CNN's town hall Thursday. \"The vaccine has to be safe, it's got to reduce transmission, and then it's got to protect the health of the individual. And these vaccines, the FDA laid out how they want these trials to be done. Fortunately, they required a proof of efficacy. But they set the bar pretty low at 50% efficacy. So the first vaccine that gets approved may be fairly weak in some of these criteria.\" Gates said that his foundation is funding not only the first generation of vaccines and the capacity for those, \"but also a second generation that will be ready four to six months later that may get us closer to 100% protection or 100% transmission reduction.\" \"So there's a lot of uncertainty in the vaccine enterprise, which is hard to explain, you know, when people want to summarize is the vaccine miracle on its way,\" Gates added. Watch: ##Town Hall## Microsoft founder Bill Gates believes there could be some advances in testing and therapeutics in the next year. \"I think the therapeutics is actually the most promising thing and not talked about as much as the vaccines because if you have multiple therapeutics that, between them, are reducing the death rate and the amount of serious sickness by over 80%, probably over 90%, that does start to reduce the horrific burden,\" the philanthropist said. \"So I think by the end of the year, therapeutics will be making a big difference,\" he said. Gates said by the first half of 2021, the first round of vaccines could be approved. \"Then by the end of 2021, if people are willing to take the vaccine, we'll be able to stop the transmission in the rich countries and maybe within nine months after that in the world at large,\" he said. Watch: ##Town Hall## One of the real problems that could occur as schools reopen this fall for in-person learning is the spread of Covid-19 to older people, Microsoft founder and philanthropist Bill Gates said. Gates' comments follow new US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines on education and childcare that favor the opening schools, saying children don’t suffer much from coronavirus, are less likely than adults to spread it, and suffer from being out of school. \"The real problem comes as an infection gets connected to someone that's older. So if the teacher's over 65, if that kid lives in a multigenerational household, where it's not easy to separate the kid from the older person, that's the part of this that does create real risk,\" Gates told CNN during its global coronavirus town hall. \"Now, we have this huge benefit of having those kids in school, and so this is going to require some judgment. It's not going to be close all schools or open all schools. There are various things about having half the kids go in one week and half the other week so you can space kids out. There are things that will be tried.\" Gates was heartened over the news that \"there's likely to be money for schools on a bipartisan basis in this next bill, because funding some of that and spreading best practices there will mean we can reduce the education deficit.\" More on the CDC guidelines: The new CDC guidelines posted Thursday do recommend that local officials should consider closing schools, or keeping them closed, if there is substantial, uncontrolled transmission of the virus.  The CDC has been promising new guidelines for more than a week, after demands from President Trump that the agency alter its recommendations for opening schools. They were posted on the agency’s website Thursday afternoon with little public notice and no explanation of what has been changed.  Watch: ##Town Hall## ##Schools## Microsoft founder Bill Gates called the coronavirus infection rate in the US \"deeply troubling\" and doesn't suspect things will get better soon. \"The infection rate in the US is deeply troubling, because the summer, when it's warmer and people are indoors more, actually, it's easier to reduce the infection than it's going to be out in the fall. And right now, those infections are largely in young people, which means the death rate, although it's come up, is nowhere near its peak,\" Gates said during CNN's global coronavirus town hall tonight. \"So things are definitely on the bad side of what we would have predicted four weeks ago.\" Helping to find a vaccine: Gates said on June 25 that he's aligned with Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, on his prediction that there will be a viable vaccine by the end of the year, or early 2021. He said he and Fauci are in constant contact. In February, Gates, who along with his wife Melinda, run the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation, pledged up to $100 million to help contain the coronavirus outbreak around the world. They said the funds would be used to help find a vaccine for the virus, limit its spread and improve the detection and treatment of patients. Watch: ##Town Hall## Colombia’s health ministry reported 315 new coronavirus deaths Thursday, raising the country’s total to 7,688. The daily figure is the highest number that Colombia has reported so far in the pandemic. The ministry also reported 7,945 new cases Thursday, bringing the total number of confirmed coronavirus cases to 226,373.   This comes the same day that Colombia’s capital added five more parishes to its list of those on lockdown.  Around 5 million people, from 13 parishes, are now on lockdown in Bogota. ##Hotspots## A convention official described chaos inside the Republican National Committee after President Trump pulled the plug on convention activities in Jacksonville, Florida. The official described the situation as “a multimillion dollar debacle and think of where that money could have gone,” noting the funds could have been better spent on fighting the virus. The official went on to say that some convention staffers simply don’t know what to do now. The official added there were some questions whether all campaign staffers scheduled to work the event would actually show given concerns about the virus. This official said a key moment in the decision to scrap Jacksonville came when the local sheriff said adequate security could not be provided for the convention given the pandemic. That sheriff, the official said, has close ties to other local officials in the area who were all becoming more concerned by the day about hosting the convention. The Justice Department’s internal watchdog found that a federal prison in California, where nearly 1,000 inmates have tested positive for coronavirus, was slow to implement safety measures and lacked adequate staffing to confront the growing pandemic.  At Federal Correctional Complex Lompoc, in Santa Barbara County, California, a nationwide order to restrict the movement of prison staff wasn’t fully implemented for more than two weeks because of a staff shortage — possibly allowing workers to bring the virus inside prison walls, a review released Thursday by the Justice Inspector General’s office found. Two staff members who showed up for work in late March with coronavirus symptoms made it past a weak screening process, and one inmate who had complained of coronavirus symptoms on March 22, wasn’t isolated or tested for days. The review of Lompoc represents the first official scrutiny of the federal prison system’s handling of coronavirus after months of dire warnings from advocates and politicians that more needed to be done to protect the vulnerable prison population. Ninety-eight federal inmates have died since the start of the pandemic, including four at the California prison.  In April, as the number of positive inmate cases across the federal system jumped towards 500, the inspector general’s office announced it would begin a series of remote inspections of a selection of the Bureau of Prison’s 122 facilities. The watchdog office has since surveyed over 38,000 prison employees nationwide and conducted phone interviews with staffers as well as a review of documents and data at 16 sites. The report on Lompoc, as well as a second report on FCC Tuscon in Arizona, are the first to be released, with more expected in the coming months.  In an interview with CNN in April, the director of the Bureau of Prisons called confronting the pandemic the most challenging situation the federal prison situation has been confronted with in decades.  \"I don't think anybody was ready for this Covid, so we're dealing with it just as well as anybody else and I'd be proud to say we're doing pretty good,\" Michael Carvajal said in his first interview since being named director amid the pandemic. The Bureau of Prisons has taken a wide range of steps since the virus was first detected — shutting down visitations, instituting quarantines for all new inmates temporarily moving all of the country's 150,000 federal inmates into near-isolation. Attorney General William Barr also directed prison officials to expand programs to release certain vulnerable inmates early into home confinement in an effort to protect them from the virus and thin out the population of overburdened facilities.  While the report released Thursday found that the Bureau of Prisons surged resources to an office that considered inmates for early release —cutting down processing times from months to just two weeks — the application of the new abilities to release prisoners early as a result of the pandemic was “extremely limited” at Lompoc. Only eight inmates had been transferred to home confinement under the new programs by mid-May, while more than 900 inmates had been sickened by the virus there, according to the inspector general review. For those that remained bars, their access to medical treatment was limited by a severe staffing shortage. When the outbreak hit Lompoc, medical staffing at the prison was at just 62%. The prison’s ability to screen inmates for coronavirus symptoms was negatively impacted as a result, the report concludes. The Bureau of Prisons has since dispatched additional medical staff as well as correctional officers to prisons facing staffing shortages, including Lompoc.   Seventy percent of Lompoc staff surveyed by the inspector general’s office also said that staff needed more personal protective equipment, and 36% said that inmates needed more hygienic products — despite masks and hygiene kits being handed out by the prison weeks into the pandemic.  By contrast, no inmates have tested positive for coronavirus at the federal prison in Tuscon whose response to the pandemic was detailed in the second report released by the inspector general on Thursday.  That report found that adequate staffing levels and empty housing units that could be converted to quarantine space allowed the facility to prevent the introduction of the virus from the outside world. Still, 77% of staff surveyed by the inspector general’s office at the Tuscon prison said they wanted more protective equipment.  BOP did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ##Hotspots## House Speaker Nancy Pelosi slammed President Trump’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic, saying Thursday night that he has been \"the biggest failure, practically in the history of our country.” During an interview with MSNBC, Pelosi also responded to Trump’s decision to cancel convention activities in Jacksonville, Florida. \"I think it’s a little too late for him to be responsible,\" she said of the decision. Pelosi added that the coronavirus pandemic is “rolling like a freight train.” She criticized Republicans and the White House for struggling to finalize a proposal for the next round of stimulus legislation. The California Democrat said they are “in total disarray” and the slipping timeline for introducing a bill has “gone beyond the pale.” Pelosi claimed that all Republicans care about “is what’s happening at the corporate boardroom table.\" “There is a very big difference here,” she said. \"They really don’t intend to meet the needs of the American people, and they will be fully exposed.\" ##Stimulus## Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said he plans to roll out school reopening plans on Tuesday.  “Our kids need to be in school because kids not only academically are suffering, emotionally, mental health, we know kids suffer in mental health capacity, child abuse reporting is way down and we don't believe it's because child abuse is down it's because schools and teachers are a reporting mechanism for that. There are a number of working families who need for their children to be in school so they can continue to work. There's a lot of reasons why schools can be and should be open. So long as we do that in a way that protects teachers and protects students at the same time we believe we can do,” Lee said. The Tennessee Department of Health has reported 86,987 total cases of coronavirus and 925 deaths since the pandemic began. These figures include an increase of 2,570 cases and 37 deaths in a single day, according to the department. “Wearing a face covering when in public is a simple but effective way for us to each do our part and help stop the spread of Covid-19,” Lee said.  ##Schools## New US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines on education and childcare come down hard in favor of opening schools, saying children don’t suffer much from coronavirus, are less likely than adults to spread it, and suffer from being out of school. But the new guidelines posted Thursday do recommend that local officials should consider closing schools, or keeping them closed, if there is substantial, uncontrolled transmission of the virus.  The CDC has been promising new guidelines for more than a week, after demands from President Trump that the agency alter its recommendations for opening schools. They were posted on the agency’s website Thursday afternoon with little public notice and no explanation of what has been changed.  They start with an unsigned statement on “the importance of reopening America’s schools this fall.” “The best available evidence indicates that Covid-19 poses relatively low risks to school-aged children,” the statement said. “Children appear to be at lower risk for contracting Covid-19 compared to adults. To put this in perspective, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as of July 17, 2020, the United States reported that children and adolescents under 18 years old account for under 7 percent of Covid-19 cases and less than 0.1 percent of Covid-19-related deaths.\" The CDC said scientific studies suggest that Covid-19 \"transmission among children in schools may be low.\" \"International studies that have assessed how readily Covid-19 spreads in schools also reveal low rates of transmission when community transmission is low,\" the organization said. More details: The CDC statement says extended school closures harm children.  “It can lead to severe learning loss, and the need for in-person instruction is particularly important for students with heightened behavioral needs,” it reads. The new guidance notes that children often get food, mental health care, speech language therapy and other services at school. Other guidance takes into account the risk of transmission in schools and from schools. Many medical experts have said it’s not safe to open schools while coronavirus is spreading in a community. The guidelines take note of these arguments. “If there is substantial, uncontrolled transmission, schools should work closely with local health officials to make decisions on whether to maintain school operations,” the statement said. “The health, safety, and wellbeing of students, teachers, staff and their families is the most important consideration in determining whether school closure is a necessary step.\"  The guidelines suggest that school administrators consider keeping children in cohorts or pods to reduce the risk of spread. They also encourage the use of social distancing, hand hygiene, face masks and other measures to control spread – and incorporating these measures into school curricula. “There is mixed evidence about whether returning to school results in increased transmission or outbreaks,” the guidelines note, and reference studies done in other countries that have taken various approaches to reopening schools. “It is important to consider community transmission risk as schools reopen. Evidence from schools internationally suggests that school re-openings are safe in communities with low SARS-CoV-2 transmission rates.” The guidelines recommend against screening all students for coronavirus.  “CDC does not currently recommend universal symptom screenings (screening all students grades K-12) be conducted by schools,” the guidelines read. “Parents or caregivers should be strongly encouraged to monitor their children for signs of infectious illness every day,” they add. “Students who are sick should not attend school in-person.” ##Schools## The President of Bolivia's Supreme Electoral Court, Salvador Romero, announced on Thursday that the new date for the country's presidential election will be moved to October 18 with a possible second round on November 29, so that proper coronavirus safety measures can be implemented.  \"What is appropriate is to organize and celebrate the elections with adequate and solid measures of health protection,\" Romero said in a televised speech. \"This will be done by the Court, fulfilling its historical responsibility in the most complex electoral process of democracy, subject to multiple crises.” Bolivia's National Scientific Committee had sent a letter to Romero on Monday, recommending not to carry out the elections in September due to the high number of coronavirus infections. The election was scheduled to take place on September 6, after being delayed again from its initial date in May. The country's former long-term leader Evo Morales, who resigned after the 2019 election over allegations of ballot fraud, quickly criticized the announcement.  \"The postponement of the election date will only cause more suffering to the Bolivian people because it prolongs the agony of the government in a sea of incapacities and ambitions that prevented them, in eight months, from taking measures to manage the current human and economic catastrophe,\" Morales, who is currently in Argentina, said in a series of tweets. Morales also accused the interim government of trying to \"gain more time\" ahead of the election.  Interim President Jeanine Áñez, who has vowed to hold new elections soon, is running against the candidate of the Movement for Socialism party, Luis Arce, backed by Morales. Also running are two former presidents, Jorge Quiroga, and Carlos Mesa. Why this matters: Bolivia is one of the hardest hit countries by the virus in Latin America. Infections have continued to rise rapidly in recent weeks. The country has so far reported more than 64,100 coronavirus cases and over 2,300 deaths, according to the latest numbers by Johns Hopkins University.  ##Hotspots## The 2020 MLB regular season is set to begin, as the Washington Nationals are hosting the New York Yankees at Nationals Park. The ceremonial first pitch was thrown by Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.  Receiving the ceremonial first pitch was Nationals pitcher Sean Doolittle. Fauci wore a No. 19 jersey and had on a mask and a Nationals cap. The pitch didn’t reach the plate, going wide to the left. A new 2019 World Series Champions flag was raised at Centerfield Plaza. Lineups for both teams were announced by the public address announcer, with his words echoing around the empty stadium. In a moment of solidarity both teams took a knee in support of unity. The National Anthem was a pre-recorded performance by DC Washington, and members from both teams were seen standing during the playing of it.   Brazil has reported 59,961 new cases of coronavirus over the past 24 hours, according to the country's health ministry Thursday.  On Wednesday, Brazil reported 67,860 new Covid-19 cases, the highest number its seen since the start of the pandemic. Thursday's numbers were the second highest. The ministry also reported 1,311 new deaths on Thursday. Brazil has 2,287,475 total Covid-19 cases and 84,082 deaths as of Thursday. The Ministry of Health confirmed to CNN that its data system had issues this week but couldn't specify what states have been affected.  \"Some states had difficulty inputting their data on the Covid-19 in the System during the weekend (07/18 and 07/19),\" the ministry said. \"We emphasize that the ministry promptly assisted the states in solving the problem.\" ##Hotspots## Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey said public school classes need to begin on time this year, even if they start with learning from home.  “Arizona will be open for learning, and our priorities will be public health and safety,” Ducey said Thursday in a news conference. The governor said the state health department will work on benchmarks over the next two weeks for when it will be safe for schools to return to normal in-person classes. In the meantime, districts are expected to have on-site services in school buildings to serve kids who need a place to go during the school day. Ducey said there are positive signs for the state’s fight against coronavirus spread.  “We're one of two states in the country where new cases are decreasing. That's where we prefer to stay,” Ducey said. The governor signed an order extending the closure of bars, gyms and water parks for another two weeks. That order had been scheduled to expire next Monday. The state is setting aside $370 million in CARES Act funding for schools to deal with the higher costs of digital and hybrid learning, but Ducey acknowledged the school changes will be difficult on everyone.  “This is the greatest challenge to public education in our lifetimes,” he said. ##Schools## Los Angeles County reported more than 2,000 new coronavirus cases for the fourth day straight, Health Officer Muntu Davis said at a briefing.  L.A. County added 2,014 new cases today, bringing the total number of cases in the county  to 166,848.  There have been at 4,262 Covid-19-related fatalities in the county. More than half all Covid-19 deaths in California have occurred in Los Angeles County. ##Hotspots## There are 10 hospitals in Mississippi with no intensive care unit beds available, Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves said in a news conference on Thursday. Reeves said there is approximately 115 ICU bed reserves that can be flexed up to make additional ICU beds.  He said the state is seeing increases in positive cases in people ages of 0 and 17, which have had a 37% growth rate since July 12. The second fastest age group is between 18 and 29, which has seen a 30% increase since the start of the pandemic. Mothers infected with Covid-19 are unlikely to pass the infection to their newborns when appropriate health precautions are taken, according to a study published Thursday in The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health.  Researchers reported no cases of viral transmission among 120 babies born to 116 Covid-positive mothers, even when both shared a room and the mothers breastfed.  Still, precautions were taken: Babies remained in enclosed cribs and six feet apart from their mothers, except while breastfeeding. Mothers were also required to wear surgical masks when handling their child and followed proper hand and breast washing procedures.  All babies included in the study were tested for Covid-19 via a nasal swab within 24 hours after birth. After, researchers conducted follow up exams and tests.  Of the original 120 babies, 82 completed a follow up five to seven days after birth. The majority, 68 babies, had roomed with their mothers and 64 were still breastfed. Seventy-nine of these babies were tested again at five to seven days, and 72 were tested two weeks after birth.  None of the results were positive, and none of the babies showed Covid-19 symptoms, the team at Weill Cornell Medicine-New York Presbyterian children’s hospital reported. They noted that blood, fecal and urine Covid-19 tests had not been approved at the time of the study. If a baby was infected in the womb, the nasal swab test might not have detected the virus. The researchers also relied on what the mothers reported themselves about their hand hygiene and mask usage. Recommendations for mothers with Covid-19 and their newborns vary. The study affirms current guidance by the World Health Organization and the American Academy of Pediatrics. The pediatricians’ group updated its guidance Wednesday. Brazil's most famous coronavirus patient, President Jair Bolsonaro, said during his daily walk Thursday that he will be taking another coronavirus test \"in the next few days\" and asked for patience while the country is trying to address several challenges.  \"Brazil has been doing a lot of wrong things that have been going on for a long time, we can't fix it overnight. I ask for your patience, right? Any business there, people usually criticize and shoot down,\" Bolsonaro said.  Bolsonaro told CNN affiliate CNN Brasil on Wednesday that he had tested positive again for Covid-19, just over two weeks after his initial test came back positive. He has been working in semi-isolation from the presidential residence since July 7, when he first announced he had tested positive. Bolsonaro touted hydroxychloroquine again, despite a warning from the Brazilian Society of Infectious Diseases urging medical professionals to stop using the drug to treat coronavirus because it has been proved ineffective and can cause damage. ##Hotspots## Cloth face coverings should have at least two layers to be most effective, and preferably three, according to new research published Thursday. And a set of videos brings the evidence to life. A team in Australia used tailored LED lighting and a high-speed camera to capture the dispersal of airborne droplets from someone talking, sneezing and coughing while wearing different types of face coverings – bare faced, with a single layer of cloth, a double layer and a medical grade surgical mask. The results were clear, the team at the School of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering at the University of New South Wales reported in the British Medical Journal’s Thorax.  While they said a single-layer face covering is better than nothing \"a double-layer cloth face covering was significantly better at reducing the droplet spread caused by coughing and sneezing,\" they added. The single layer mask was made from a t-shirt, using a no-sew method. The two layer mask was made using the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s method that uses two rectangles of cotton layered over one another.  While the surgical mask was the most effective at preventing transmission of droplets, cloth face coverings did reduce the spread of droplets.  “From the captured video it can be observed that, for speaking, a single-layer cloth face covering reduced the droplet spread but a double-layer covering performed better. Even a single-layer face covering is better than no face covering,” the researchers wrote. “Guidelines on home-made cloth masks should stipulate multiple layers (at least 3),” they added. “Several other factors determine the efficacy of cloth masks such as type of material, the number of layers, the arrangement of different layers and frequency of washing.”  ##Masks## Jacksonville, Florida, Sheriff Mike Williams and Mayor Lenny Curry said in a joint statement they appreciate President Trump considering public health and safety and canceling the Jacksonville portion of the Republican National Convention. \"We appreciate President Donald Trump considering our public health and safety concerns in making this incredibly difficult decision,\" they said. The mayor and sheriff continued: \"As always, in Jacksonville public safety is our number one priority. President Trump has once again reaffirmed his commitment to the safety of Jacksonville, Florida and the people of the United States of America.\" More than 150 prominent US medical experts, scientists, teachers, nurses and others have signed a letter to political leaders urging them to shut down the country and start over to contain the surging coronavirus pandemic. “The best thing for the nation is not to reopen as quickly as possible, it’s to save as many lives as possible,” they wrote in the document, which was sent to the Trump administration, leading members of Congress and state governors on Thursday. “Right now we are on a path to lose more than 200,000 American lives by November 1st. Yet, in many states people can drink in bars, get a haircut, eat inside a restaurant, get a tattoo, get a massage, and do myriad other normal, pleasant, but non-essential activities,\" the letter said. They say the only way to reopen the economy and the country safely is to follow a set of protocols that public health experts deem necessary for controlling the spread of Covid-19. The group includes things like having enough daily testing to test everyone with flu-like symptoms, a work force of contact tracers large enough to track all current cases and more personal protective equipment to keep essential workers safe. In addition, the letter says all nonessential businesses should be closed and restaurants nationwide should only provide take-out service. People should only leave their homes to get food and medicine or fresh air and exercise, and masks should be mandatory in all situations, the letter urged. Leaders should also ban interstate travel to help contain the virus.  “If you don’t take these actions, the consequences will be measured in widespread suffering and death,” the letter warned. “Our decision makers need to hit the reset button,” said Matt Wellington, the public health campaigns director for the advocacy group US PIRG, which joined with health experts to draft the letter. “Continuing on the path we’re on now will result in widespread suffering and death. And for what? Health experts laid out criteria for how to reopen safely. It’s time to listen to them,” Wellington said. New Mexico will delay in-person learning through at least September 7, Labor Day, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said in a news conference today.  Schools may begin online or distance learning in August, Lujan Grisham added. After Labor Day, New Mexico will phase in a hybrid model bringing the youngest students back to school first, then middle schoolers and finally high schoolers, she said. Prior to this decision to delay in-person learning at the state-level, 40% of school districts had already made the decision to pause in-person learning, Lujan Grisham said.  ##Schools## New guidance released by the American Academy of Pediatrics on Thursday outlines interim advice for families weighing a return to youth sport activities based on the most current coronavirus research.  “We recommend that parents talk to their pediatrician about the type of sport and setting, local disease activity, and individual circumstances, such as an underlying health condition that places the athlete or family members at high risk,” said Dr. Susannah Briskin, an author of the guidance, in a news release.   Recommendations made by the American Academy of Pediatrics for sports include a prioritization of non-contact activity, physical distancing and disinfecting frequently touched equipment. It also said families can expect modifications made by sporting bodies and local governments to practices, competitions and events amid Covid-19. Testing for Covid-19 before participating in sports is discouraged unless an athlete is symptomatic or has been exposed to someone known to be recently infected. “The risk can be decreased, but not eliminated, by athletes, parents, coaches, and officials who follow safety protocols,” Briskin added. “Ultimately, this will be an individual choice for the parent to decide if they will allow their child to participate in sports.”  Consistent practice groups that don’t mix youth athletes may help reduce team-wide outbreaks, it says. Sharing of equipment and use of communal spaces such as locker rooms should be reduced. When possible, areas with poor ventilation, such as weight rooms, or small spaces where distancing isn’t possible should be avoided. More precautions: Cloth face coverings should be worn by coaches, officials, spectators and volunteers.  Athletes should wear a cloth face mask and physically distance on the sidelines. Masks should be worn when nonvigorous exercise is being performed and physical distancing isn’t possible. Cloth masks should not be worn for water activities or when they can catch on equipment or result in impaired vision, such as in gymnastics or cheer.  ##Schools## New Mexico recorded an all-time high number of new Covid-19 cases today with 343, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced at a news conference today. New Mexico currently has 167 people in the hospital and 34 people on ventilators with five new deaths, Lujan Grisham added.  New Mexico has a total of 18,163 Covid-19 cases, 596 total deaths and 496,085 tests have been conducted statewide, she said.  To note: These figures were released by New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, and may not line up exactly in real time with CNN’s database drawn from Johns Hopkins University and the Covid Tracking Project. President Trump called on Congress to pass $105 billion for schools as part of the next coronavirus relief bill at a news conference on Thursday. He said the money would be used to support measures like smaller class sizes, teachers aides, rearranging spaces for social distancing and masks. But, if schools do not open, Trump said the money should \"follow the student so the parents and families are in control of their own decisions.\" \"If schools do not reopen, the funding should go to parents to send their child to public, private, charter, religious or home school of their choice – the key word being choice,\" he said. Trump said it's important for schools to reopen so parents can go back to work and individual families should be able to make decisions that are best from them, adding that reopening schools is not political. \"I hope local leaders put the full health and well-being of their students first and make the right decision for children, parents, teachers and not make political decisions. This isn't about politics,\" Trump said. Watch: ##Schools## US Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams believes Florida can turn things around in time to reopen schools in August, Adams told CNN.  Earlier this week, Adams said transmission rates needed to go down before schools could reopen.   CNN shared with Adams the latest data from the Florida Department of Health, showing that the positivity rate in the state has ranged from 13% to 18% in the past two weeks and that the 14-day average positivity rate in Miami-Dade County is 20%. The school year in Florida begins in August. “I do think it’s possible in about a month,” Adams said. “We’ve seen places around the United States and around the world turn around very high case rates in just a few weeks.  The disease course is only two weeks. That’s how long it takes coronavirus to go through your system. That means we can break the cycle if we can do the right thing in just a couple of weeks. It will probably take a couple of cycles. But a month is enough time to for us to turn around these case rates.\" \"We just need everyone to do their part and not fixate on what’s going to happen a month from now and fixate on what we can do today to make school openings in a month a reality,\" he added. During a live address Wednesday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis argued for the reopening of schools in part because children, he said, were at a lower risk and played the “smallest role in transmission” of the virus.  CNN asked Adams about a South Korea study published this week by the CDC that concluded minors between the ages of 10 to 19 spread the virus at least as well as adults. Adams said the study is credible. “It's important to know that for younger people, the virus is lower risk for complications than death. But low risk doesn't mean no risk,” Adams said. ##Hotspots## ##Schools## President Trump announced today at a press briefing that there will not be Republican National Convention activities in Jacksonville, Florida, because of the coronavirus pandemic. The President said events in Charlotte, North Carolina, will still be held and he will still make an acceptance speech in a different form. \"We won't do a big crowded convention per se, it's just not the right time for that,\" Trump said. Trump said he “looked at his team” and told them, “it’s time to cancel the Jacksonville component of the GOP convention.” “The delegates are going to North Carolina, they’ll be doing the nomination,” Trump said. He added that telerallies would take place as well. Watch: CNN's Nikki Carvajal contributed to this report. Texas reported at least 9,507 new Covid-19 cases on Thursday, bringing the total number of cases in the state to approximately 361,125. The state also reported at least 173 Covid-19-related deaths on Thursday. About 4,521 people have died across the state since the start of the pandemic. Currently, there are at least 8,858 Covid-19 patients in Texas hospitals.  Note: These numbers were released by the Texas Department of State Health Services, and may not line up exactly in real time with CNN’s database drawn from Johns Hopkins University and the Covid Tracking Project. ##Hotspots## The US Department of Justice said Thursday it would waive its usual antitrust restrictions for companies trying to work together to speed antibody-based treatments for coronavirus. It said it would not challenge proposed efforts by Eli Lilly and Company, AbCellera Biologics, Amgen, AstraZeneca, Genentech, and GlaxoSmithKline to share information, including about manufacturing facilities and raw materials, to make monoclonal antibodies to treat or prevent Covid-19. “The demand for monoclonal antibodies targeting Covid-19 is likely to exceed what any one firm could produce on its own,” the DOJ said in a statement. “Moreover, waiting until regulators approve specific treatments before scaling up manufacturing might delay access to these potentially life-saving medicines by many months, which adversely could affect the nation’s efforts to fight Covid-19.” More details on the science and law: Monoclonal antibodies are natural or lab-made immune system proteins that home in on and neutralize a single specific target on a virus, or a cell. They’re being made in this case to try to stop coronavirus from infecting cells in people’s bodies. Antitrust restrictions are meant, in part, to stop companies from coming together to fix prices or to make agreements on carving up markets and forcing out competitors.  The DOJ said the biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies had agreed not to do this.  “Among other competitive safeguards, they have committed that they will not exchange information related to the prices of those treatments or the costs of inputs for or production of those treatments,” the DOJ said.   Admiral Dr. Brett Giroir, the assistant secretary for health for the US Department of Health and Human Services, said Thursday that he has been in talks with universities and colleges to help them strategize how they should be testing students when they return to campus this fall.  Giroir said that a lot depends on the rates of cases in the community and the specific demographics of the university, but generally, he has been urging universities to do surveillance testing. Giroir emphasized this is not diagnostic testing, but surveillance testing that won’t burden the health system and could help universities track potential outbreaks and manage them early – before they become a bigger problem. He said the labs on campus, even veterinary labs, could run these tests. The labs will not need an emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration to do this.  He said these labs can also do pool testing, which will be returned quicker. With pool testing, if a group of tests turns up positive, the lab can then refer those five students into the diagnostic testing system. “Nothing’s a perfect solution, but it does not burden the health care system,” Giroir said, “and it lets colleges keep control of how they want to do it.”  ##Schools## Hospitalizations are on the rise in all areas of Louisiana, with strains on capacity particularly in three regions: Lafayette, Lake Charles and Central Louisiana, Gov. John Bel Edwards said during a Thursday afternoon news conference. Edwards said that some hospitals have had to put elective procedures on hold to create more capacity to treat Covid-19 patients. Dr. Amanda Logue, chief medical officer of Lafayette General Health, said her hospital system has put elective procedures on hold to create more beds as they are \"quickly running out of space.\" The hospital system has had to decline 87% of transfer requests this month and has had to transfer some of their own patients as far away as Mississippi because they can't treat them, Logue said at the news conference. They also don't have enough staffing to meet the capacity needs, as some have fallen ill, she added.  \"Some of our beds are unfortunately closed because of illnesses to our staff. So we've had some nurses. We don't have enough nurses to staff all of our beds right now,\" Logue said. Logue said the hospital will continue to treat all emergency patients but is unable to do elective procedures.  Dr. Henry Kaufman, chief medical officer for Our Lady of Lourdes Regional Medical Center, said his hospital is also having issues with capacity due to staffing needs.  \"The problem isn't needing more space, it's having enough people to staff the beds and keep the nurses healthy,\" he said. Kaufman said the intensive care unit at his hospital system is \"near complete capacity.\"  He said he is also concerned that the delaying of elective surgeries has already had impacts on the community, as mammograms, recommended bypasses, and other procedures have been put on hold. \"I am still dealing with the aftermath of people presenting with the later stages of disease during our first wave of Covid cases,\" Kaufman said. \"I have women who have weren't able to get their mammogram during the first wave and finally were able to get it, and likely presented with a later stage of disease and they would have otherwise.\" Some context: Louisiana crossed the 100,000 case mark Thursday when 2,408 new cases were reported. The state now has 101,650 Covid-19 cases.  Roughly 91% of the new cases reported were community spread and 33% of the cases were identified in people age 29 and under, according to the Louisiana Department of Health.  New temporary restrictions to mitigate the resurgence of Covid-19 in Indianapolis, Indiana, were announced today. “Masks are still mandatory – doubly so after the governor’s order. Aside from the list of exceptions provided in today’s order, masks must be worn over the nose and mouth whenever we are around each other in public – indoors or outdoors,” Mayor Joe Hogsett tweeted Thursday. The mayor announced that social gatherings, including wedding receptions, banquets, and club meetings, won’t be allowed to exceed 50 individuals. This doesn’t include indoor religious ceremonies, which can be held at up to 50% capacity. Outdoor ceremonies can continue without restriction, Hogsett said.   The mayor has also ordered that bars and nightclubs that don't serve food, close until at least August 12, including bar seating at restaurants. While outdoor seating is preferred, restaurants can operate at 50% indoor dining capacity, but have to close for in-person dining between midnight and 5 a.m.  Personal services like tattoo parlors, nail and hair salons, and spas can operate by appointment only, while gyms and other fitness centers will be allowed to operate at 25% capacity.  “While we are not putting in place travel restrictions at this time, we recommend that those traveling to states or nations with heightened rates of infection should self-quarantine for 14 days upon return,” Hogsett added. “Finally, for tourism, cultural, entertainment, and sports venues, we are modifying our existing order to allow no more than 25% capacity, with continued adoption of CDC social distancing guidelines.” ##Masks## Even though the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cannot start ranking leading causes of deaths until the end of the year in order to get a full year's worth of data, statisticians at the agency told CNN in an email on Thursday that they expect Covid-19 will end up among the Top 10 leading causes of death in the nation. \"We know that based on the # of COVID-19 deaths so far in 2020, it will end up as a Top 10 leading cause of death but won’t know exactly how high it will rank until next year,\" CDC mortality statisticians said in the email. \"Heart Disease and Cancer, the two leading causes of death in the U.S., account for more than half of all deaths in the U.S. each year and that isn’t expected to change.\" Final data are based on death certificates for the calendar year. In 2018, the latest year for which final data is available, the top 10 leading causes of death among all ages in the United States were: Heart disease (655,381)\nCancer (599,274)\nUnintentional injury (167,127)\nChronic lower respiratory disease (159,486)\nStroke (147,810)\nAlzheimer's disease (122,019)\nDiabetes (84,946)\nFlu and pneumonia (59,120)\nNephritis (51,386)\nSuicide (48,344) As of 5 p.m. ET, nearly 144,000 people have died from Covid-19 in the United States so far this year. ##Hotspots## A study released Thursday suggests less than 1% of Canadians have had Covid-19, although the rate of infection is likely several times higher than the number of reported cases. While the study mirrors one released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention earlier this week, showing far more people were infected with the virus than originally observed, Canadians remain quite vulnerable to the virus.  “One of the reasons we released this study early was to say look ‘take a bow,’ we really did a good job of containing community spread of this virus as a society but please note how susceptible the vast majority of us remain and lets be really careful in the fall,” said Dr. David Naylor, co-chair of Canada’s Immunity Task Force, in an interview with CNN. Canadian public health officials say the country did a good job of containing the virus but warn that given these immunity results, keeping the virus contained in only going to get tougher as the economy reopens. “There was early on this strange enthusiasm for herd immunity, that the virus would ripple through the population and we would all have immunity and we’d all be fine. That was always reckless and misguided simply because of the toll the virus would take but we also see here that was certainly unattainable,” said Naylor. About the study: This early study examined 10,000 blood donations received in Canada between May 9 and June 8. A larger, follow-up study will be released in the coming weeks to get a more comprehensive assessment of the spread of the virus in Canada. The study makes clear that \"doubling down on good public health practices is imperative\" if Canada is to avoid a resurgence of the virus. Naylor added that Canada has to \"up its game\" when it comes to testing and contact tracing. “We’ve got to be smarter and more creative about how we do tracing and quarantine because realistically we have perhaps about a year of this current stalemate,” Naylor said.   Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, speaking at a virtual news conference on Thursday,  said she is working to “iron out” disagreements fueling the legal battle with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp over Covid-19 restrictions in the city.  She described a Wednesday call with Kemp as being a “good conversation” and went on to say the two are in agreement that “masks save lives.”  “It’s not my desire as mayor of this city to have a very public fight with the governor of this state,” Bottoms said. “I do believe that there’s a finite amount of energy that we all have. I would much rather focus my energy on leading the city through Covid-19 and many of the challenges that we are now facing and I trust that the governor would like to do the same on behalf of the state.\" Bottoms also clarified the phase one rollback she announced on July 10 is a voluntary plan with voluntary guidelines. ##Masks## The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services has reported 1,637 new Covid-19 cases on Thursday, a record single-day increase.  The total number of coronavirus cases in the state now stands at 37,700, the department said. Today's record number surpasses Wednesday's record of 1,301 Covid-19 cases reported in a single day.  The department also reported 20 new Covid-19-related deaths, bringing the total number  to 1,179 in Missouri. \"The daily report of new cases represents a wide variation in when specimens were collected, when tests were performed, and when results are reported and entered,\" the department tweeted. \"For this reason, we continue to focus on the 7-day positivity rate which has been increasing and tells us that community transmission is occurring in some parts of the state.\" The department said there is no delay in reporting positive results from labs to patients. To note: These figures were released by the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Service, and may not line up exactly in real time with CNN’s database drawn from Johns Hopkins University and the Covid Tracking Project. The Brazilian Health Ministry will not renew its contract to continue the country's largest epidemiological Covid-19 study as the pandemic continues to take a toll across the country, according to the university heading up the research.  EPICOVID19-BR is a serological study by Federal University of Pelotas (UFPel) to understand the “evolution of the prevalence of Infection by Covid-19.\" Preliminary results released by the university on July 2 suggested that almost 90% of people infected with coronavirus are symptomatic, even when the symptoms are mild. The research also found that loss of smell and taste are symptoms of Covid-19, and that children can be infected as much as adults.  The EPICOVID19-BR study also suggests that the number of people infected with coronavirus in Brazil is 6.5 times higher than the official government figure.  It is one of the largest Covid-19 studies of its kind in the world, based on the number of test participants, according to Pedro Hallal, an epidemiologist and dean of UFPel.  More than 90,000 people in each of Brazil’s 26 states and the Federal District of Brasilia have been tested in three stages of research to map the pandemic so far, at a cost of about $3 million, said Hallal.  Until now, the research was funded by Brazil’s Ministry of Health.   \"When we presented the results of the last phase of the study at the beginning of July, we were told the government would like to continue it. But, since then, the ministry is totally silent,\" Hallal said. In a news conference on Tuesday, Interim Health Minister Eduardo Pazuello said the study was very good, but unable to deliver a national view of the pandemic.  \"Brazil is very heterogeneous, and we would need individualized studies in each region of the country. That is what we are analyzing,\" he said. Hallal explained it’s important to continue the study because Brazil is still in the middle of the pandemic.  \"We would understand the new moments of the pandemic. We would know to what extent the outbreak is stronger now in the south and the center-west, we would know if it is really going down in the north,” Hallal said. With the apparent lack of continued funding from the federal government, the university is looking for other potential backers, and is currently in negotiations with one entity, according to Hallal. ##Hotspots## Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis had phone conversations with President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence Wednesday to discuss Covid-19, the governor’s press office told CNN. The office would only say that DeSantis and Trump discussed Covid-19 and would not expand further. The governor and Pence, the office said, discussed the need for the antiviral drug remdesivir in Florida. At a news conference today, DeSantis announced Florida would be receiving a shipment of 11,000 vials of remdesivir on Friday. When CNN asked for a readout of the calls, the governor’s press office said it does not generate readouts of the governor’s calls. ##Hotspots## Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell addressed the delayed timeline for the release of the GOP stimulus plan in remarks on the Senate floor Thursday afternoon, saying the Trump administration has asked for more time to review the plan before its unveiling. The stimulus plan should be out \"early next week,\" McConnell said. McConnell said that GOP senators, who have taken a leading role in crafting the plan, will introduce individual components of the proposal on Monday.   “The Senate majority has assembled a framework for CARES 2. The administration has requested additional time to review the fine details, but we will be laying down this proposal early next week. We have an agreement in principal on the shape of the package,” he said.  Some context: Senate Republicans had initially planned to unveil the proposal today, but the release was delayed amid holdups.  “Chairman Alexander, Chairman Shelby and Chairman Blunt are finalizing an ambitious package of funding and policy to help our schools reopen. They will lay out a reopening-related funding package for schools and universities north of $100 billion. That’s more money than the House Democrats proposed for a similar fund,” McConnell said, adding, “there will be several important policies to help childcare providers, grant new flexibility to elementary and secondary schools and more.”  McConnell previewed other components of the plan, saying that “Republicans want to send a second round of direct payments to American households, and Senator Collins and Senator Rubio have crafted a sequel to their historic and incredibly successful Paycheck Protection Program.\"  ##Stimulus## The United States has done about 51.7 million Covid-19 tests and has been performing an average of about 770,000 tests per day recently, according to Admiral Dr. Brett Giroir, the assistant secretary for health for the US Department of Health and Human Services. Currently there is a national positivity rate of 9.08% over the past seven days, he said during a briefing with reporters on Thursday. “We’re all very concerned about the outbreaks which are occurring across the country,” Giroir said, adding they are particularly concerned about California, Arizona, Texas and Florida. But, Giroir said public health measures are starting to make a difference.  “We are making progress,” Giroir said. The positivity rate is starting to level off, he said, and in some cases, starting to drop. The seven-day rolling averages of cases is starting to turn downward, he said.  “No one is declaring victory about this,” Giroir added. Giroir said face masks, physical distancing and good hand hygiene is important, especially in the hotspots that are seeing a surge in cases. The hotspots need to have 90% or more of people wearing masks, he said. That, combined with closing bars and indoor dining, is “essentially the equivalent to shutting down the entire economy.”  The Covid-19 response team in the past two weeks has gone to 19 locations. The government is also sending teams to help with testing at nursing homes and opening up a surge testing site in Miami, Giroir said. On testing: Giroir said the government wants to reduce test turnaround time as much as possible and pooled testing could help improve the efficiency by 20% or 30% in labs. The government will prioritize certain areas as well. It will be putting point-of-care testing in nursing homes that will improve the turnaround time there and better protect those vulnerable populations. There are 654 point-of-care testing machines in nursing homes currently. Over the next two to three weeks, the government will send out an additional 1,700. Giroir also said that his department is working with manufacturers to better understand their production schedules for August. He expects about 51 million tests will be available, half of which will be used for point-of-care testing.  In September, there should be 65 million tests. Giroir said some of the other testing supplies will remain “tight” as long as there is infinite demand.  ##Hotspots## A US Marine assigned to Marine Helicopter Squadron One, the unit responsible for transporting the President, has tested positive for coronavirus. The service member had flown to Bedminster, New Jersey, in anticipation of President Trump's upcoming visit there.   \"Out of an abundance of caution, Marines who may have had contact with the infected Marine have been removed from the detachment. The infected Marine was never in direct contact with the President’s helicopter, Marine One,\" a spokesperson for the US Marine Corps told CNN in a statement. \"Prior to the President’s planned travel to Bedminster, NJ, Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) was informed that a HMX-1 Marine on detachment in Bedminster, NJ in support of the White House had tested positive for Covid-19.\" Politico was first to report that a member of the unit tested positive.   One-third of all coronavirus cases confirmed in the past month in Wisconsin were among people in their 20s, said Andrea Palm, secretary-designee of the state's Department of Health Services. Palm said the increase in cases is attributed to residents “attending gatherings like parties, bars, and barbecues.”  At least 45,899 cases of coronavirus have reported in Wisconsin and at least 878 people have died from the virus in the state since the beginning of the pandemic. \"Please the safest thing to do is stay home, limit your interactions, and wear a mask or cloth face covering,\" Palm said.   Note: These numbers were released by the state of Wisconsin and may not line up exactly in real time with CNN’s database drawn from Johns Hopkins University and the Covid Tracking Project. \"Miracle Larry\" Kelly is home. After 128 days in the hospital — including 51 on a ventilator — the 64-year-old New Yorker is a coronavirus survivor. \"I was one of the early cases. And in many ways I was a Guinea pig because they knew nothing about it. So, they threw everything at me,\" Kelly told CNN's Brianna Keilar during a live interview. Kelly's early prognosis was so grim that doctors suggested he be taken off of life support, and family members had begun to pay their last respects. But Kelly had other ideas. \"The last text message I sent to my wife right before I was vented, I said I promise I'll never stop fighting. I kept that promise,\" he said. As Kelly battled for four months, fighting a virus that to date has claimed the lives of more than 140,000 Americans, one mid-April Sunday offered a sliver of hope. \"I open my eyes on Easter Sunday, which is why I believe the moniker 'Miracle Larry' came from. But on Easter Sunday in New York, 527 people died,\" said Kelly.  \"So people were dying all around me and I didn't die. And is that a miracle? I don't know.\" Further hampering Kelly's fight were complications including a coma, pneumonia in both lungs, and massive bleeding in the brain.  There were \"tubes everywhere, EEG (electroencephalogram) on his brain. He looked awful. My sister didn't even want to see him like that,\" Kelly's daughter Jackie recalled. Family members took turns recording messages on a mobile phone, playing them in Kelly's ear one by one inside his Mt. Sinai hospital room. Months later, the recordings have taken on a different tone. \"Jackie actually played the phone conversations with the doctors that she had with her crying and them telling them all the gloom and doom,\" Kelly said. \"Jackie and Dawn were getting very upset and they looked over at me and I wasn't. And they were staring at me and I said to them 'well, I know how it ends.'\"  Even with a contagious sense of humor, Kelly admits to grim days during his Covid-19 fight. \"I was in a very dark place. And you know, I didn't see any white light but I saw a lot of black and dark and a pit. And I thought I was heading the other direction, which is why I probably survived. I kept thinking let me explain myself.\" With family by his side, Kelly credits not only those closest to him — but also those he'd never met — for his remarkable story of survival. \"There's so many commercials on that say we're all in this together. And that's the only message I can give people. I was a stranger to those people at Mt. Sinai and they worked tirelessly to keep me alive,\" Kelly said, before adding a word of caution to those still doubting the severity of Covid-19. \"This disease is no joke. And if there's anybody out there thinking it's a big hoax, I'm so glad my family and a lot of my friends who know me, are following protocol because I don't want to lose any of them.\" CORRECTION: This post has been updated to reflect that Larry Kelly spent 51 days on a ventilator in a hospital. The Arkansas Department of Health is reporting at least 1,013 new positive cases of coronavirus since Wednesday. That brings the total statewide to at least 36,259 positive cases and at least 386 deaths since the pandemic began, Gov. Asa Hutchinson said during a news conference on Thursday. Arkansas’ cumulative positivity rate is 8%, at least 107 patients are on ventilators and at least 480 patients are hospitalized, according to Dr. Jose Romero, Arkansas Department of Health Acting Secretary. Hutchinson said some of the increase was due to delay in reporting. ##Hotspots## In the United States, about 41% of adults had at least one underlying medical condition that may put them at a higher risk for severe Covid-19 outcomes, according to a new report published Thursday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  The research, published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly report, looked at five conditions that tend to put people at greater risk for more severe disease from the coronavirus: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic kidney disease and obesity. It did not include other conditions, such as sickle cell disease or organ transplants.  What the study found was that the numbers of adults with these conditions varied by county –– from almost 1 in 4 adults to as many as two-thirds of adults in a county. In half of US counties, almost 1 in 2 adults were estimated to have an underlying condition.  There were higher proportions of people with these health conditions living in rural areas, and in Appalachia and in the Southeast.  The most common underlying condition was obesity, followed by diabetes, COPD, heart disease and chronic kidney disease.  What this means: The CDC authors said the data on these conditions is limited at the county level. They hope the report can help public health leaders use the information to help them make decisions about what areas might need more health resources that may be overlooked otherwise.  Rural areas, that already had been struggling with a lack of health care resources prior to the pandemic, for example, may need even more help. These areas may have smaller populations, but they have communities that have more people with underlying health conditions that may put them at greater risk of needing to be hospitalized for the disease.   The Tennessee Department of Health has reported 37 new coronavirus deaths Thursday, a record single-day total for the state.  The department said there has been a total of 925 Covid-19 deaths in Tennessee. The state also added 2,570 new coronavirus cases Thursday, its highest one-day case count in 10 days. More than 1,000 Covid-19 patients are hospitalized in Tennessee. To note: The figures above were released by the Tennessee Department of Health and may not line up exactly in real time with CNN’s database drawn from Johns Hopkins University and the Covid Tracking Project. There have been at least 4,005,414 cases of coronavirus in the United States since the start of the pandemic, and at least 143,820 people have died across the country, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.  JHU recorded the first case of coronavirus in the United States on January 21: It took the country 99 days to reach 1 million cases on April 28. \nIt then took 43 more days to reach 2 million cases on June 10.\nIt took another 28 days to surpass 3 million cases on July 8.\nIt has taken the United States only 15 additional days to surpass 4 million cases. The US is the global leader in Covid-19 cases, followed by Brazil, India, Russia and South Africa:  ##Hotspots## The Georgia Department of Public Health reported 4,286 new Covid-19 cases Thursday, bringing the state total to 156,588. The department also reported 25 new coronavirus-related deaths. The total Covid-19 death toll for Georgia is now 3,360.  There were 431 new Covid-19-related hospitalizations recorded on Thursday.  To note: These figures were released by the Georgia Department of Public Health and may not line up exactly in real time with CNN’s database drawn from Johns Hopkins University and the Covid Tracking Project. Coronavirus cases in France have increased by 26% in one week and 66% in three weeks, the country's health ministry said Thursday.  It comes after French Health Minister Olivier Véran said on Tuesday that \"the virus circulation is increasing,\" yet the country is \"very far\" from a second wave.  Health authorities warned Wednesday that increased testing was \"in part responsible for the increase in the number of cases.\"  France recorded 1,062 new cases on Thursday, according to the health ministry. The ministry said there have been at least 179,398 Covid-19 cases recorded in the country since the start of the pandemic. It also said the death toll rose by 10 in the past 24 hours, bringing the total to 30,182. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy announced a $6 million lease emergency assistance grant program to assist small businesses with up to $10,000 in direct help to pay their rents. The grants, a New Jersey Redevelopment Authority (NJRA) initiative, will help small businesses in 64 communities covered by the authority. The grants will be paid for through federal CARES act funding, Murphy said. \"We will not let Covid-19 take us down,\" Murphy said Thursday.  \"We cannot get to where we need to be and where we know we will be without the women and men who own and operate the small businesses that make a municipality a community and turn a street into a gathering place for that community,\" he added. Speaking at the news conference, Leslie Anderson, president and CEO of the NJRA, emphasized that this is a grant and not a loan, meaning businesses are not obligated to pay it back. Anderson also said that businesses cannot exceed 5,000 square feet in order to be eligible for the grant, a requirement the authority is enforcing in order to ensure only small businesses benefit from the grant. Murphy also reported during the news conference that over the last four months, 1.4 million New Jersey residents have filed claims for unemployment, \"including 26,000 over the prior week.\"  This is the second straight week the state has seen a \"significant decline\" in unemployment filings, said Murphy. The latest numbers: There are 344 new Covid-19 cases and 23 deaths in the state, said Murphy. The positivity rate is 2.88%.  Note: These numbers were released by the county public health agency, and may not line up exactly in real time with CNN’s database drawn from Johns Hopkins University and the Covid Tracking Project. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi announced a $1 billion loan to Latin America and the Caribbean for Covid-19 vaccine access during a virtual gathering with his Latin American counterparts on Wednesday, according to a statement released by the Mexican Foreign Affairs Ministry. “China’s Foreign Minister said that the vaccine developed in his country will be a public benefit of universal access, and that his country will designate a loan of 1 billion dollars to support access [to the vaccine] for the nations of the region,” the statement said.  During this daily briefing on Thursday, Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador thanked China after the loan announcement.  \"We're very grateful to China, with the Chinese government, the President – you remember I had the chance to speak to him on the phone – we asked him for support with medical equipment, there have been many aid flights coming from China,\" he said. \"There's always been enough equipment supply, medicines, and now there is this offer,\" he added.  ##Vaccines## The Brazilian state of São Paulo surpassed 450,000 coronavirus cases and 20,000 deaths on Thursday while authorities work to fix a technical issue with the registration of new cases.  Health authorities said São Paulo, Brazil's most populous state, has recorded 452,006 coronavirus cases and 20,894 deaths in the nearly five months since the start of the pandemic. The first case in Brazil was registered on Feb. 26, according to the health ministry.   São Paulo Disease Control Coordinator Paulo Menezes said the spike in new cases registered on Wednesday and Thursday was due to a \"system instability\" on the data input server. São Paulo registered 16,777 cases on Wednesday, its second highest number since start of the pandemic, and 12,561 on Thursday.   The highest daily figure in the state was 19,030, recorded on June 19.   \"Between Thursday and Tuesday, the number of cases was reduced across the country,\" Menezes said. \"The effects of this update can be felt until tomorrow.\" The Ministry of Health confirmed the issue earlier to CNN but couldn't specify what states have been affected.  \"Some states had difficulty inputting their data on the Covid-19 in the system during the weekend,\" the ministry said. \"We emphasize that the ministry promptly assisted the states in solving the problem.\" ##Hotspots## Coercive quarantine mandates can send coronavirus patients into hiding, defeating the purpose of having such a policy, the World Health Organization said Thursday. Covid-19 case contacts are more likely to develop and potentially transmit the disease to others, and it is “much, much better if someone is ready, willing and able to quarantine themselves on behalf of their community,” WHO’s Dr. Mike Ryan said Thursday. “Quarantining yourself when you are a contact is an act of courage. It’s an act of contribution to society,” Ryan said. “We’ve seen some pretty intense clusters of cases shut down pretty quickly when quarantine has been implemented successfully in contacts.” However, he said, some governments have laws in place to make quarantine and isolation mandatory. “We do clearly state the where such mandatory quarantine rules are in place, the state implementing that mandate must also respect the human rights of the individual,” Ryan said. “They must be in a position to provide an appropriate level of supporting care to that individual. That should not cost that individual in terms of extra out of pocket expenses for the purposes of staying in a hotel.” WHO is against coercive procedures, Ryan said. “It can shove the problem underground. And it can mean that people are unlikely to report their status in terms of either being a case, or being a contact, if they feel they will be unfairly treated,” he said. This means that it is exceptionally important to make sure that there is strong community engagement, to help people understand how diseases spread and understand the roles they play in both transmitting and breaking the transmission chains of Covid-19, he said. “In our experience, when people understand that fact, and they understand their own personal status, and when they’re supported in the process, most — the vast majority of people — will participate in the quarantine mechanism,” Ryan said. “And we would like to avoid coercive mechanisms to do that.”  Here's what WHO recommends: WHO’s recommendations say that contacts of confirmed cases of Covid-19 should be quarantined for 14 days in a facility or in the home if they have the ability to quarantine appropriately there. Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO’s technical lead for Covid-19, said that quarantine in the context of contact tracing is “arguably one of the most important elements to breaking chains of transmission.”  She also said that WHO will be updating guidelines for quarantining and isolation in the next week or so, although there will not be many changes. The main differences include removing the testing requirement at the end of the quarantine period and including language that focuses on children in isolation and quarantining of children with family members so they aren’t separated.   New York City has 18,839 confirmed coronavirus deaths and 4,624 probable coronavirus deaths as of July 23, according to the most recent data on the city website. The New York City Health Department defines probable deaths as people who did not have a positive Covid-19 laboratory test, but their death certificate lists as the cause of death “Covid-19” or an equivalent. The total number of confirmed coronavirus deaths and probable coronavirus deaths in New York City is 23,463. Some context: There have been 219,489 coronavirus cases in New York City and 55,825 people have been hospitalized, according to the city. The data is from the New York City Health Department and was updated on today at 1 p.m. ET, according to the website. The numbers may not line up exactly in real time with CNN’s database, which is drawn from Johns Hopkins University and the Covid Tracking Project. More evidence is emerging to underscore that the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine does not help Covid-19 patients.  A study published in The New England Journal of Medicine on Thursday found that the use of hydroxychloroquine – given either alone or in combination with the antibiotic azithromycin – did not improve the conditions of hospitalized patients with mild-to-moderate Covid-19. The study, led by researchers in Brazil, included 504 patients with confirmed Covid-19 who either needed no supplemental oxygen, or were receiving up to 4 liters per minute of oxygen. The study was conducted across 55 hospitals in Brazil. The patients were randomly assigned to receive either standard of care; hydroxychloroquine at a dose of 400mg twice daily; or hydroxychloroquine at a dose of 400mg twice daily, plus azithromycin at a dose of 500mg once daily for seven days, according to the study. The researchers then assessed how the patients were doing 15 days later. The study noted that receiving either hydroxychloroquine alone or hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin did not appear to affect the condition of the patients at the 15-day mark. Additionally, unusual heart rhythms and elevated liver-enzyme levels were more frequent in patients receiving hydroxychloroquine alone or with azithromycin, according to the study. Overall, the researchers wrote that \"among patients hospitalized with mild-to-moderate Covid-19, the use of hydroxychloroquine, alone or with azithromycin, did not improve clinical status at 15 days as compared with standard of care.\" The study was funded by the Coalition Covid-19 Brazil and EMS Pharma, a pharmaceutical company in Brazil. The Republican stimulus text will likely be released on Monday, a GOP aide told CNN.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell may take to the chamber floor later today to announce where things stand.   The White House and Senate GOP still haven't finalized how they'll structure their proposal to extend expiring jobless benefits, two sources involved in the talks told CNN. The dispute centers on the mechanics of how to implement the unemployment benefits. Latest on stimulus negotiations: After days of back-and-forth on a stimulus proposal with the White House, Republicans and the administration reached what Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin called Thursday morning a \"fundamental understanding,\" though many of the details are still being hammered out. Republican senators say the White House conceded to Senate Republican demands during the negotiations — namely on money for contact tracing and testing, making funds available for schools that stay closed and dropping President Trump's demand for a payroll tax cut.  And, a top Republican chairman is pushing back on Trump's claim that testing is \"overrated,\" saying it's essential to get a hold of the virus. ##Stimulus## South Africa has crossed the threshold of 400,000 confirmed Covid-19 cases. The country also has 6,000 confirmed Covid-19 deaths, President Cyril Ramaphosa said Thursday evening in a televised address to the nation.   The country’s 408,052 confirmed cases is the fifth highest globally, according to a tally from Johns Hopkins University. “The next few weeks will put our resources and resolve as never before,” Ramaphosa said. During the address, Ramaphosa also announced that all public schools will close for the next four weeks as the country experiences a peak in infection rates, extending the current academic year beyond 2020.  Schools were previously closed during the country’s initial lockdown. Ramaphosa announced that certain grades will return sooner than others. “It is important that schools do not become sites of transmission as our infections are rising fast,” Ramaphosa said.  Ramaphosa said his government would be focused on investigating and punishing corruption in the country’s Covid-10 response as several scandals of alleged procurement fraud in government and price gouging by companies have surfaced in recent weeks.  \"The consequences for those who break the law or bypass regulations must be severe,”  Ramaphosa said. “The people of South Africa require nothing less than full accountability from those who have been elected and appointed to serve them.”  ##Hotspots## Uganda has registered its first Covid-19 death, the country's Ministry of Health said Thursday. The Seychelles and Eritrea are now the only countries in Africa not to have reported a Covid-19 death, according to Johns Hopkins University data. Uganda’s first reported death is a 33-year-old Ugandan woman, from Namisindwa District, who was admitted to the hospital on July 15 and treated for severe pneumonia after suffering Covid-19 symptoms. She died on July 21, the Ministry of Health tweeted Thursday. So far, 30 of her contacts have been traced and placed under quarantine by local health authorities, the ministry said. They will be monitored for 14 days and tested for the virus. \"The listed contacts so far include family members, and healthcare workers. The process of contact identification and listing is still ongoing, and we believe the number of contacts may increase as the extensive epidemiological investigation evolves,\" the ministry added. Some background: Since the pandemic began, at least 1,079 Ugandans have tested positive for Covid-19, Ministry of Health figures showed Thursday. The country took stringent steps to try to halt the spread of the virus early on in March. It was one of the first African countries to impose travel restrictions on its citizens and others traveling from 16 countries it said had a high number of cases of coronavirus, including the US and UK.  It was also among the first African country to announce a ban on large public gatherings including weddings, church and Jumat services for a period of 30 days. On March 18, schools were closed and public rallies banned. The country’s President Yoweri Museveni notably encouraged Ugandans to stay home during the country's lockdown by releasing his own home workout video. At least 157 Covid-19-related deaths were being reported in California in the past 24 hours, marking a single-day high for number of coronavirus deaths in the state.  These new deaths bring the state’s death toll to more than 8,000, according to data from California Department of Public Health. California added 12,040 more confirmed coronavirus cases in the past 24 hours, for a total of 425,616 total cases since the pandemic began. This is the second highest daily uptick, following only yesterday's reported high of 12,807. The positivity rate in the Golden State over the past two weeks stands at 7.6%. The number of hospitalized patients and those in intensive care units are down slightly in the past day.  Note: These numbers were released by California Department of Public Health, and may not line up exactly in real time with CNN’s database, which is drawn from Johns Hopkins University and the Covid Tracking Project. ##Hotspots## The three countries worst hit by coronavirus right now are strong and able, but the World Health Organization can help if needed, officials said Wednesday. “We are always ready and will always remain ready to provide advice, input and service to any of our member states wherever they are,” WHO’s Dr. Mike Ryan said during a briefing Thursday in Geneva. “Obviously, the United States is not in need of our assistance most of the time,” he added.  Ryan said that the WHO regional office for Southeast Asia was in Delhi and one of their largest country offices in the Americas is in Brazil. “Those countries are intertwined with us,” Ryan said. The US, Brazil and India lead the world in new coronavirus cases at present. Ryan said he believes all three of these countries are “powerful, able, democratic countries, who have tremendous internal capacities to deal with this disease,” and they can “turn this around, because of the nature of their public health, their science and their innate capacities to fight this disease.”  Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO’s technical lead for coronavirus response, agreed with Ryan. “We are here to help all countries, and we work through our regional offices and we work through our country offices to provide support to everyone, everywhere,” she said. “And I think just a message to say that even in those three countries that have the highest number of cases right now, can be turned around. It can be turned around, and there are tools that all countries have that can do that.” These tools involve physical distancing, hand hygiene and being informed about where the virus is present, Kerkhove said. Peru’s President Martín Vizcarra announced his government issued an emergency decree in order to impose additional measures and help the region of Arequipa, which has become the new epicenter of the Covid-19 pandemic in the country. Vizcarra said Peru’s health ministry will intervene and cooperate with Arequipa’s regional government to tackle the crisis after the region reported a significant increase in the number of coronavirus cases in the last few weeks. “The health ministry involvement as a national authority in the Arequipa region is needed to alleviate the crisis due to the increase of Covid-19 cases and deaths. There are resources and the will to fix the problem in Arequipa,” the president said on Wednesday evening during a televised address to the country. Arequipa, in southern Peru, had been one of the least affected of Peru’s 24 regions. It registered 11,012 Covid-19 cases and 601 deaths on Wednesday evening, according to data released by the health ministry.  Vizcarra traveled to the region last Sunday and admitted the lack of resources in the region. His administration had ordered more than 110,000 rapid tests, almost half million drugs and more than one million personal protective equipment units (PPE). “This help hasn’t arrived yet,” the president said.  “They are even asking for donations,” he added, according to state news agency, Andina. Dr. Miguel Palacios, dean of the Medical College of Peru, told CNN the government’s announcement is a good start but more action is needed as the situation in Arequipa has reached breaking point.  “The health system has been totally overwhelmed, we think Arequipa should be declared a 'health disaster area' to be able to activate more resources apart from the health ministry’s support,\" Palacios said. Palacios highlighted that hospitals have reached their capacity, there is lack of oxygen for treating patients and a shortage of doctors, many of them working with delayed payments and under challenging labor conditions. At least 120 doctors have been infected with the virus while nine have died in Arequipa since the pandemic started, Palacios told CNN. More on the country's figures: On Wednesday evening, Peru’s Health Minister Pilar Mazzetti Soler announced 3,688 new Covid-19 deaths that were previously unaccounted for. The new deaths were brought to light after an analysis by a special commission that studied 20,000 cases from March to June, Mazzetti Soler said.  With Mazzetti Soler's announcement, Peru's Covid-19 death toll went from 13,767 to 17,455. Peru’s health ministry reported 366,550 Covid-19 cases on Wednesday evening. At least 2,650 doctors have been infected with coronavirus while 95 have died due to the virus, according to data released by the Medical College of Peru. ##Hotspots## The Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) announced 1,624 new cases of Covid-19, bringing the total number of cases statewide to 166,925. This is the highest daily total of cases since May 25, according to the numbers published by the IDPH website.  IDPH said in a news release that the seven-day positivity rate is 3.4%.   There are 20 new deaths associated with the virus, bringing the state’s total to 7,367, according to the release.  The state also reported that 1,473 people are hospitalized with 309 in intensive care units and 135 on ventilators.  Note: These numbers were released by the Illinois Department of Public Health and may not line up exactly in real time with CNN’s database drawn from Johns Hopkins University and the Covid Tracking Project.    The Louisiana Department of Health reported a total of more than 100,000 cases of coronavirus in the state. According to the agency, at least 2,408 new coronavirus cases were reported Thursday, bringing the total number of cases statewide to 101,650. Community spread made up about 91% of new cases and 33% of the cases were identified in people ages 29 and under, the agency tweeted. The total number of deaths statewide stands at 3,574, with 16 new fatalities reported Thursday, the agency said. According to Johns Hopkins University's website, at least 11 other states have reported more than 100,000 coronavirus cases. Note: These numbers were released by the Louisiana Department of Health and may not line up exactly in real time with CNN’s database drawn from Johns Hopkins University and the Covid Tracking Project. Spain’s northern region of Aragon will bring back phase two of the de-escalation process for some counties following an increase in the number of Covid-19 cases. People in the area of Bajo Cinca, Bajo Aragón-Caspe, Comarca Central and Monegros will be asked to stay in their county and only leave when absolutely necessary. Meetings of over 10 people are forbidden and the capacity of bars and restaurants will be reduced. La Litera, Cinca Medio, Barbastro and Huesca counties will continue to be in a \"relaxed phase two,\" said Sira Repollés, Aragon’s health councillor. About the numbers: Spain recorded 971 new coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours, the highest number since May 8, the Spanish health ministry’s data showed on Thursday Nearly half of those new cases — 422 — are in Aragon. Only three people died from coronavirus in Spain on Wednesday, bringing the death toll to 28,429.   María José Sierra of the health ministry's emergencies coordination unit said at a news conference on Thursday that “the number of cases is rising but it is not putting pressure on the health system because 50% of them are asymptomatic. The average age has gone down to 45 years old.\" Sierra said that although there are 281 active outbreaks in the country, “we are most concerned about the regions of Aragon and Catalonia.”  “There is not only outbreaks. There is also community transmission,\" she added. The government of the southern Murcia region also announced Thursday that it will put the municipality of Totana after identifying an outbreak in which 55 people tested positive for coronavirus. There have been at least 3,991,061 cases of coronavirus in the US and at least 143,495 people have died from the virus, according to Johns Hopkins University's tally of cases. The totals include cases from all 50 states, the District of Columbia and other U.S. territories, as well as repatriated cases.  On Thursday at 1:00 pm ET, Johns Hopkins had reported 20,155 new cases and 305 additional deaths.   Here's a look at the US states with the highest number of cases:  ##Hotspots##  Countries coming out of lockdowns and countries with low levels of Covid-19 will still experience potential clusters and outbreaks of the disease, Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organization’s Health Emergencies Programme, said on Thursday.  Ryan explained during a news conference that even in countries that have brought down the virus \"under extreme control,\" such as Germany and Spain, \"there's always a chance that the disease can be imported or the disease can spread from unseen clusters.\"  Ryan said that rather than implementing widespread lockdowns, governments should be \"more precise\" in how they contain an outbreak. \"Instead of restricting everyone, we try and go after the virus. And we try and identify where the virus is, and then specifically and surgically, in the sense, excise the virus from the community by minimizing the impact on the lives and livelihoods of the community,\" Ryan said.  Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO's technical lead for coronavirus response and head of its emerging diseases and zoonoses unit, said that if outbreaks \"are dealt with swiftly\" through testing and contact tracing, \"you have an opportunity to really put that fire out quickly.\"  Coronavirus is spreading fast in some countries, the World Health Organization said Thursday.  “We continue to see intense transmission in a relatively small group of countries,” WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said during a briefing in Geneva.  Tedros said 15 million cases of Covid-19 and 620,000 deaths have now been reported to WHO. “Almost 10 million cases, or two thirds of all cases globally, are from 10 countries,” he said. “And almost half of all cases reported so far are from just three countries.” The US, Brazil and India have the highest numbers of new cases currently.  “Even in those three countries that have the highest numbers of cases right now (it) can be turned around,” WHO’s Maria van Kerkhove said later. Tedros reiterated that political leadership and community engagement are the “two vital pillars of the response.” Here's a look at the countries with the highest number of confirmed cases, according to Johns Hopkins University data:  ##Hotspots## Supplemental guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on safely reopening schools during the pandemic could be released as early as tonight, two federal officials told CNN. A senior administration official said that five supplemental guidance documents have now been completed and described their release as \"imminent.\" Some background: Earlier this week, CNN reported that the supplemental guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had been cleared though the federal review process by the Office of Management and Budget. The White House initially said this guidance would come out last week, but a CDC spokesman confirmed late Friday that it would be delayed because the documents weren't ready.  President Trump had criticized current CDC reopening guidance as \"too tough.\" A federal health official also confirmed the timetable to CNN, and, reacting to previous delays in this process, the source said: “I will believe it when I see it.”  Many school districts in the U.S. are set to resume classes in some form as soon as two weeks from now. ##Schools## An ensemble forecast published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now projects more than 164,000 coronavirus deaths in the United States by August 15. The new projections, published Thursday, forecast 164,477 deaths by August 15, with a possible range of 158,490 to 173,431 deaths.  “National and state-level ensemble forecasts suggest that the number of new deaths over the next 4 weeks will likely exceed the number reported over the last 4 weeks for the US overall, as well as in 25 states and 1 territory,” the CDC says on its forecasting website. The jurisdictions with the greatest likelihood of a larger number of deaths include:  Alabama\nFlorida\nGeorgia\nIdaho\nNevada\nOklahoma\nSouth Carolina\nTexas\nUtah More on the projection: Unlike some individual models, the CDC’s ensemble forecast only offers projections about a month into the future.  The previous ensemble forecast, published July 15, projected roughly 157,000 coronavirus deaths by August 8. At least 143,446 people have already died from Covid-19 in the United States, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. ##Hotspots## e York state is monitoring rising coronavirus rates among younger people, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said in a news conference Thursday. A graphic presented during the press conference showed a 13.2% test positivity rate for individuals between the ages of 21 to 30, compared to 9.9% a week earlier, he said, calling the statistic “a significant increase in a short period of time.\" \"It's not hard to understand what is going on ... you get groups of young people - it's warm, they've been locked up for a long time and would like to socialize — I get it. You don't socially distance, you don't wear masks, the virus spreads, and it is happening,\" the governor said. \"This is not the time to fight for your right to party ... There's an attitude that young people are immune — you are not. 21 to 30, the virus can kill you. And if it doesn't kill you, you can bring it home and give it to someone inadvertently and it can kill them,\" Cuomo added.  Cuomo also announced a new ad campaign aimed at young people:    Arizona has now lost over 3,000 people to Covid-19, according to data reported by the Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS) on Thursday.   ADHS reported at least 89 new Covid-19 related deaths Thursday, bringing the total number of deaths to 3,083.  The state has a total of at least 152, 944 total cases, according to the state's dashboard.   Arizona is currently seeing a 42.61 death rate per 100,000 people and a 12.5% positivity rate.   ##Hotspots## Florida's Broward County has 1,309 people hospitalized with Covid-19 currently, according to the Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA). Just 9.8% of their beds are still available in intensive care units, with 52 beds, Broward County health officials reported Thursday. Broward is the second hardest hit county in South Florida, behind Miami-Dade, with 45,010 total Covid-19 cases reported, according to the state's Department of Health.  Last week, Broward instituted an overnight curfew from 11 p.m. until 5 a.m. local time in an effort to control the surge there.  The county also has a mask mandate with fines of up to $500, CNN has reported. ##Hotspots## Republican senators say the White House conceded to Senate Republican demands during the negotiations — namely on money for contact tracing and testing, making funds available for schools that stay closed and dropping President Trump's demand for a payroll tax cut.  On school funding: After Trump and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos warned that aid to schools would be withheld without them fully reopening, the Senate GOP pushed back and charted a different course. According to Sen. Roy Blunt, a key negotiator in the GOP-White House deal, he said about half of the $70 billion for K-12 schools in the plan would be given regardless if they are open or not. The other half would \"go out on the basis that you have more expenses if you’re back to school than you do if you’re not.\" Blunt added: \"But none of the college money and only half of the elementary and secondary money would be conditional on returning to school. And that doesn’t mean returning to five-days-a-week school.\" On the payroll tax cut: The White House has acknowledged that it dropped the payroll tax cut, something that Republican senators indicated would do little to stimulate the economy.  On tracing and testing: And the White House agreed to ramp up testing to $25 billion after suggesting that there was already plenty of unspent money to use for testing and contact tracing. The GOP deal would provide $16 billion in new money, with an additional $9 billion redirected from the March stimulus law to spend on testing and tracing. \"We did get the $25 billion we wanted, but part of it was being sure they were gonna spend $9 billion that was not specifically allocated to testing on testing,\" Blunt said. How this unfolded: Several Republicans pointed out that the White House had to move quickly in the GOP direction in order to get a deal together. Sen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican up for reelection, contended he was not concerned that it took all week to get their party's proposal together, but noted the White House \"moved in our direction.\" \"We had to resolve some of the conflicts with the administration,\" Tillis said. \"They've moved in our direction, it's a normal part of the sausage factory.\" Sen. Lamar Alexander, who chairs the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said a key issue that the White House and Senate GOP agreed to was how to defer student loan payments. He said the two agreed to continue deferring student loan payments after October \"if you don't have any income but once you start making the income, you'll never have to pay more than 10 percent of it on your student loan after you deduct, rent, mortgage and food.\" Asked about Trump's claim that testing is \"overrated,\" Alexander pushed back. \"I can give you my opinion on testing which is that testing is essential,\" Alexander said. \"And I think probably the most important activity we have going on in the government right now in terms of identifying the disease, containing it, and creating confidence to go back to school and that work is the work Dr. [Francis] Collins is doing in the National Institutes of Health to create new ways to get a quick test so you can get a result within an hour.\" Alexander added: \"You can do that, then you can test whole classes, you can test teachers, you can test employees, there’ll be an oversupply of quick tests and I think all the discussions about testing with disappear.\" CNN's Rebecca Grandahl contributed to this report ##Stimulus## Analysts at Moody’s Investors Service said a surge in the number of coronavirus cases and the expiration of federal relief measures will “imperil economic recovery.” Though Moody’s expects “the recovery to continue over the second half of this year and unemployment to gradually decline, the worsening situation is putting the ongoing US consumption recovery at risk.”  The group’s analysis found that metro areas including Los Angeles, Miami and Dallas, where cases have spiked, together account for 26.8% of GDP. Despite retail sales having a strong “monthly pickup“ in May and June, the group said “the improving trend may not carry through July and the coming months.”  Moody’s said even without stringent lockdowns, fear of infection will likely cause consumers to voluntarily cut back on economic activities that require a high degree of person-to-person contact. The analysts also said a reduction in federal support from current levels would constitute a financial shock for many households and businesses. There were at least 706 coronavirus-related hospitalizations Wednesday, the lowest number since March 18, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said in a news conference today. \"All good news,\" Cuomo said about the data. Cuomo added that the state had climbed the \"highest and hardest mountain\" and they do not want to climb any more mountains related to the virus.  Meanwhile, at least 13 people across New York state died from the virus Wednesday. Of the 69,698 Covid-19 tests administered Wednesday, 811 — or 1.1% — were positive for the virus.   Senate Republicans have yet to formally release their next Covid-19 stimulus proposal, but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday that “what we have seen so far falls very short of the challenge that we face in order to defeat the virus.” Pelosi was joined by Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer for her weekly news conference today.  “Democrats have waited for months for our Senate Republican colleagues to get serious about helping the American people who have suffered so much during this pandemic,” and said that Democrats are “still waiting for the Republicans to put together a partisan bill that will never become law just so they can muster up the courage to negotiate,\" Schumer said . He said it is impossible to negotiate with Republicans as long as they have not shared their plan with Democrats. He called for a “specific proposal” because “the devil is in the details.” “We don’t know what it is. We hear different things all the time from different people,” Schumer said. Asked about unemployment insurance benefits, Pelosi said she is “all for the $600 because people really need it.” Republicans have considered a substantially lower number, as the provisions are set to expire at the end of the month. Pelosi said she would not accept a short term, temporary extension of the unemployment benefits.  “No, no. This is the package. We cannot piecemeal this,” she said. ##Stimulus## Former US Food and Drug Administrator Dr. Scott Gottlieb said the US could see upwards of 300,000 deaths from Covid-19 if the country doesn't change its trajectory.  \"In the United States, probably, you know, by the end of the year, we could have upwards of 300,000 if we continue on the current trajectory. Right now, we have close to a thousand casualties a day, so if we don't change that trajectory, you could do the math and see where we are at towards the end of the year,\" Gottlieb said Wednesday during an interview on CNBC's Squawk Box. Gottlieb explained that while in-hospital mortality from the virus has declined, \"the problem is we're hospitalizing a lot of patients.\" \"Right now we're gonna break our old record in terms of the total number of hospitalizations, which was 60,000. We're at 59,000 now and we're gonna eclipse that in the next week. So even if we end up preserving more life in the hospital – which we’re doing – if we end up hospitalizing a whole lot more patients, you’re ultimately going to have a lot of casualties, unfortunately, from this virus,\" Gottlieb said.  ##Hotspots##  The state of Florida is reporting 10,249 new cases of Covid-19 and 173 additional deaths on Thursday, breaking the previous record of 156 deaths on July 16, according to Florida Department of Health. This brings the state's total cases to at least 389,868 according to the state department of health. The statewide resident death toll is now 5,518. ##Hotspots## Infectious disease expert Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, says it’s very likely that the world will never be rid of coronavirus.  “We will never eradicate this virus,” Osterholm said on CNN’s “Newsroom,” comparing the coronavirus to HIV, explaining that we’ll be able to control it but it’ll never fully disappear.  “This is here for the rest of all humankind. This is a virus we’re never going to get rid of,” he said.  Osterholm’s comments come a day after Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading expert on infectious diseases, said he doesn’t “really see us eradicating” the virus fully.   “Until we actually have a commitment to getting this virus to a very, very low level, we're not going to really do much except continue to put out this raging forest fire the best we can,” Osterholm said.  Osterholm also said that while great progress is being made in the development of Covid-19 vaccine, the first iteration will be only one step.  “The best, I think, we can hope for is a vaccine that protects most of us for at least months and maybe not years. That next level of vaccines would try to do more with the immune system than we have now. But they're far, far off into the future. They’re not going to have any impact on what we're doing right now.”   Watch the interview:  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin called the discussions between White House negotiators and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell “very productive,” but acknowledged that while there is a “fundamental agreement,” both sides still need to review and finalize text – which can be a time consuming process.  “Whether this gets introduced today or not, we’re still looking at the timing,” Mnuchin said. Senate Republicans had planned to introduce the multi-part proposal on Thursday. White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows acknowledged the time crunch negotiators currently face, given the upcoming weekend and the expected funeral of Rep. John Lewis next week. “We’re working expeditiously and it’s why we’ll probably be back up here this afternoon,” Meadows said.  The real deadline negotiators are focused on, Mnuchin reiterated, is the expiration of the federal enhancement of unemployment insurance at the end of next week. On unemployment insurance, Mnuchin reiterated that the GOP plan would seek to replace the $600 enhancement with the equivalent of “approximately 70%” of wage replacement.  Other key details of the stimulus proposal: Negotiators are still working through the mechanical details of how to implement that given the issues many states have with their individual systems. The benefit extension would be through the end of the year. Mnuchin said on direct payments, “We’re talking about the same provision as last time. Our proposal is the exact same provision as last time.” Senate Republicans have proposed targeting the stimulus checks toward lower-income individuals. In the $2.2 trillion CARES Act, checks of up to $1,200 for individuals and $2,400 for families based on adjusted gross income, and $500 for each child. On the Paycheck Protection Program, Mnuchin said the proposal would allow for businesses to apply for a second forgivable loan through the program if they have under 300 employees and can demonstrate revenue losses of 50 percent or more. As to the long path ahead for negotiations with Democrats, Mnuchin pointed to past deadline deals made with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.  “We can work quickly when there’s areas of agreement,” Mnuchin said. Meadows also cited the looming unemployment cliff: “Those deadlines on Capitol Hill always work magic in the 11th hour.” ##Stimulus## Community spread of Covid-19 must be controlled in order to reopen schools safely, Dr. Wendy Armstrong, a professor of medicine at Emory University School of Medicine, said on Thursday. Armstrong said countries that have been successful in resuming in-person education for children have been able to do so due to low community transmission of the virus at the time and careful measures to avoid spread in the classroom. \"In order for schools to open safely, community spread must be controlled and must not be explosive,\" Armstrong said during a virtual panel discussion hosted by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and The School Superintendents Association.  Armstrong said schools should put in place plans that include wearing face masks, physical distancing, cleaning and ventilation. \"There need to be thoughtful evidence-based plans for what to do when positive students are identified,\" Armstrong explained. \"Schools must plan when should they close again. And these plans must be flexible to accommodate new knowledge. Armstrong said there also needs to be access to testing with a quick turnaround time. \"Testing with results eight days later is not helpful in this setting, and there needs to be access to public health interventions and contract tracing,\" she said. Reopening schools may underscore disparities that have being brought to light by the pandemic, Armstrong said. \"Clearly, more-resource schools are going to have more options available to them than schools with fewer resources, and there is the risk that this could promote the disparities that already exist with this virus among our children,\" she explained. Noelle Ellerson Ng, an associate executive director of policy and advocacy with AASA said \"there will be very few school districts that will fully open,\" adding that when it comes to reopening schools, \"it absolutely has to be a state and local decision informed by science, guidance and best practices driven by doctors, health policy experts and scientists.\" \"That is how you get ahead of something like a pandemic. And then you arm your education leaders – like superintendents and school board members – to then apply that to their areas of action,\" Ellerson added. ##Schools## The UK government has announced additional places where face coverings will be mandatory in England starting Friday. According to the Department of Health, the enclosed public spaces where face coverings will be mandatory are:  Shops and shopping centers\nSupermarkets\nBanks\nBuilding societies\nPost offices\nTake out restaurants \nTransport hubs, such as train stations and airports “It will be compulsory to wear a face covering when buying food and drink to takeaway from cafes and shops. If you are in a premises where you are able to sit down and consume food or drink that you have bought, then you can remove your face covering in order to eat and drink on site,” the release said.  The public will not have to wear face coverings in venues such as pubs, restaurants, hairdressers, movie theaters, theaters and gyms. Children under the age of 11 and people with disabilities or certain health conditions will be exempt. “Under the new regulations laid today, members of the public will need to wear face coverings - for example, a fabric covering, scarf or bandana - that covers the nose and mouth in additional enclosed public spaces, as well as frequent hand washing and careful social distancing,” the health department said.  Businesses will not be required to enforce the rule, with the government emphasizing that “the responsibility for wearing a face covering sits with individuals.\" However, businesses are encouraged to “take reasonable steps to encourage customers to follow the law,\" including through signs and providing other information in store. Police are able to issue fines of up to £100 but this is “a last resort.\" ##Masks## Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin emerged from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s office this morning to announce a “fundamental agreement” between the White House and Senate Republicans on a $1 trillion coronavirus relief package. Mnuchin said the outstanding issue is reviewing final text, which they will continue to do throughout the morning. Mnuchin and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows declined to commit to the public release of the multi-piece plan today.  What this is about: McConnell, after days of intraparty disputes and splits spilling into public view, will move Thursday to unify Republicans behind their initial $1 trillion coronavirus relief proposal. Over the course of the day today, the proposal is expected to be rolled out in pieces by the key Senate Republicans on each section, finally setting the stage for long awaited negotiations just days before the expiration of crucial federal unemployment benefits.

Both public transit ridership and traffic is up in New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Thursday at the city’s daily Covid-19 presser.  The city saw a major drop in public transportation ridership during the height of the Covid-19 crisis, but it's increasing now as the city continues to reopen. Subway ridership is up 75%\nBus ridership up 57% \nStaten Island ferry ridership up 70%\nTraffic into Manhattan is up 17%  The North Carolina National Guard (NCNG) will wind down its Covid-19 relief operations this Friday, according to a NCNG release.   The NCNG has been on duty \"for 135 days supporting North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, North Carolina Department of Public Safety, North Carolina Emergency Management, and local partners across the state,\" the release said.  There are currently 286 members on Covid-19 duty, according to the release. The NCNG will remain on standby with \"about 250 Guardsmen ready to reengage COVID-19 relief efforts if requested by the state,\" the release said.   \"We thank the men and women of the National Guard, and we thank their families and their employers for sharing them with us during this pandemic,” said North Carolina Emergency Management Director Mike Sprayberry. “The National Guard team has provided vital services to our state and we salute them for a mission well done,\" Sprayberry said\"  There were 940 soldiers and airmen activated across North Carolina supporting relief efforts during the height of its Covid-19 response, the release said.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, after days of intraparty disputes and splits spilling into public view, will move Thursday to unify Republicans behind their initial $1 trillion coronavirus relief proposal. Senate Republicans and the White House had been negotiating the plan. Over the course of day today, the proposal will be rolled out in pieces by the key Senate Republicans on each section. But according people briefed on it, here's the rundown of what's in the proposal: Second round of direct payments and some form of an extension, at a reduced rate, to the federal enhanced unemployment benefit\nSecond round of Paycheck Protection Program loans, targeted toward the hardest hit small businesses based on lost revenue and expanded to include more flexibility to forgive money used for operational and supplier costs\n$105 billion in education funds, split as $70 billion for K-12, $30 billion for colleges/universities, $5 billion for governors to utilize\n$16 billion in new funds for state testing grants, plus an administration commitment to designate $9 billion in unused funds from the CARES Act (making the total $25 billion)\n$26 billion for vaccines, including research and distribution, and $15.5 billion for National Institutes of Health\nIncreased flexibility for states to use initial CARES Act funds, including an increased time window, but no explicit new funds\nLiability protections to create a safe harbor for businesses, schools, health care providers and non-profits\nEnhanced employee retention tax credit\nDeductions for employer purchases of supplies, including testing items and personal protective equipment.\nIncrease in business meal deduction to 100%, from 50% ##Stimulus## The number of registered Covid-19 infections in Iraq surpassed 100,000 on Thursday, the country’s health ministry said.  At least 102,226 cases have been recorded since the start of the pandemic, according to the health ministry. As of Thursday, the ministry reports that at least 4,122 people have died from coronavirus in Iraq. According to data compiled by Iraq’s health ministry, Iraq began consistently recording more than 2,000 new cases a day since the last week of June. The City of Miami has issued 115 tickets for face mask violations this week, Miami Mayor Francis Suarez said during a briefing Thursday morning.  \"We have written 115 tickets,\" Suarez said. The breakdown for tickets issues includes, \"59 warnings, 41 $50 tickets, 15 $100 tickets and we have closed 15 businesses, 10 for 24 hours and five for 10 hours,\" Suarez added.  \"We need to be more disciplined than ever,\" Suarez said. The mayor said he is not issuing a stay-at-home order for the city at this time.  Some background: Suarez announced that the Florida city would increase its penalties for people not adhering to its mask mandate, raising the amount from $50 to $100 for first and second offenses.  The mayor told CNN this morning that 39 officers this week will be dedicated solely to mask enforcement. Funds collected from face mask violations will go to businesses impacted by the pandemic, he said.  ##Hotspots## ##Masks## California surpassed New York with the most cases in the nation this week. With more than 420,000 cases, the state has seen a recent surge whereas New York's reported infections have slowed significantly. California reached another peak in new cases, reporting 12,807 positive tests in a day, Gov. Gavin Newsom said Wednesday. On Wednesday, Los Angeles County health officials announced that the virus is on track to be the second leading cause of death in the county — with at least 3,400 fatalities in the first six months of the year. That would mean the disease will claim more lives than Alzheimer's Disease and strokes, health officials said. Coronary heart disease, the leading cause of death, claimed 6,000 lives in the first six months of 2019. The news comes after the county reported 2,232 hospitalized patients Monday, breaking its own record of daily hospitalizations at least four times in a week. There were 2,207 confirmed cases hospitalized Wednesday, 27% of whom are in the ICU, health officials said. Meanwhile, San Francisco is on \"high alert\" after averaging 79 new cases every day this week and seeing a 23% increase in hospitalizations, Public Health Director Grant Colfax said Wednesday. Those two numbers play key roles in helping officials determine whether to pause or roll back reopening, Colfax added. Here's a look at the areas in California with the highest number of cases per 100,000 residents, according to Johns Hopkins University data:  ##Hotspots## US stocks were slightly weaker at the opening bell on Thursday as investors grappled with an unexpected rise in initial jobless claims.

He also wouldn’t comment on how many outstanding issues there are.  “Discussions are still ongoing. It’s always in making sure the legislative text matches the understanding,” he said.  Mnuchin said once again that the payroll tax cut won’t be included, and that the President’s commitment right now is to get money out the door quickly.  What this is about: Key senators and White House negotiators said yesterday that they had reached a deal on the key piece of a new GOP stimulus plan.  McConnell told members he plans to unveil the package today not as a single bill, but in pieces based on jurisdiction, GOP Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri told reporters. That will mark the start of negotiations with House Democrats, who passed their own $3 trillion proposal in May and have been waiting for Senate Republicans and the White House to put down a marker of their own. ##Stimulus## The Georgia Department of Public Health reported 3,314 new cases yesterday, bringing the state total to at least 152,302 cases. Georgia health officials also reported 81 new deaths, the second highest daily count recorded since the start of the pandemic. The total death toll for Georgia is now at least 3,335.  There were 428 new Covid-19-related hospitalizations recorded on Wednesday.  Hear more: ##Hotspots## Dr. Frank LoVecchio, an Arizona emergency room physician who works at a number of hospitals, said doctors are rationing Covid-19 tests due to testing problems.   “We’re overwhelmed with regard to testing,” he said in an interview on CNN’s “New Day.” Many labs indicate a nine-day wait for testing results, which is “kind of ridiculous,” he said.  “Sometimes there's no swabs, sometimes there's no reagent, sometimes the lab is backed up,” he said. “...Our country did not prioritize testing; our country did not streamline this. Other countries that streamlined testing did a little bit better.” LoVecchio said that doctors are rationing tests in his emergency rooms. He said he would not give tests to people with very mild symptoms or, conversely, life-threatening symptoms, because it would not change the treatment.  “I would still tell you to quarantine if you were stable. I would still admit you to the hospital if you were very, very sick,” he explained. “Some patients are getting discharged before their test is back,” he added.  Watch more:  ##Hotspots## Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said a payroll tax cut will not be included in the forthcoming legislative package expected to be rolled out by Senate Republicans on Thursday.  Mnuchin said the President's \"priority for the moment is to get money into Americans quickly and one of the problems with the payroll tax cut is it takes time.\" Pressed by CNN on whether it will be included in this bill, Mnuchin said: \"Not in this, but we're going to come back again. There may be a CARES 5.0.\" Some background: President Trump had been pushing Congress to include a payroll tax cut in the next economic relief package. He unsuccessfully pressed for one earlier in the year, and renewed comments this week make it clear the policy remains a key White House priority. But a growing number of Republicans aren't in favor of the idea and most Democrats don't support it. Payroll tax cuts have had mixed results in the past, and some economists argue that it's not the best way to boost the economy right now. A payroll tax cut would reduce the amount taken out of workers' paychecks to fund federal programs including Social Security and Medicare. Congress would have to decide how much to reduce the rate and how long the tax holiday would last. Currently, workers pay about 7.65% of their wage and salary incomes. Employers match the amount while those who are self-employed pay both shares, though they get to deduct the employer portion. ##Stimulus## As President Trump touts progress amid the coronavirus pandemic at scripted, on-message briefings this week, top members of the coronavirus task force are privately – and publicly – expressing concern about burgeoning outbreaks across the country. Dr. Anthony Fauci said Wednesday that the US is “certainly not at the end of the game,” with a series of baseball metaphors. “I'm not even sure we're halfway through. I mean, obviously, if you want to do a score I don't want to get too cute about it but certainly we are not winning the game right now, we are not leading it,” Fauci said. And in audio obtained by journalism nonprofit Center for Public Integrity, coronavirus task force coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx privately told a group of state and local health officials about a concerning rise in cases in a series of cities, warning the officials to take mitigation action as soon as they see signs of percent positivity increasing. “There are cities that are lagging behind and we have new increases in Miami, New Orleans, Las Vegas, San Jose, St. Louis, Indianapolis, Minneapolis, Cleveland, Nashville, Pittsburgh, Columbus and Baltimore, so we’re tracking this very closely. We’re working with the state officials to make sure we’re responding together, but when you first see that increased test positivity, that is when to start the mitigation efforts,” she said during the Wednesday call. Birx continued: “I know it may look small, and you may say that only went from five to five and a half, and we’re going to wait and see what happens. If you wait another three to four, even five, days, you’ll start to see a dramatic increase in cases. So finding and tracing those very early individuals is really critical.”  Birx told the officials in places experiencing increased test positivity to “(make) sure they’re being aggressive about mitigation efforts,” noting that the administration provides governors with a weekly report with clear recommendations for mitigation.  One such report, also obtained by CPI last week, recommended that 18 states in the task force-defined “red zone” for cases should roll back reopening measures amid surging cases. Those reports are not made publicly available. Birx told the officials there are “small glimmers of decreasing test positivity in many of our metros in Texas and of course in Phoenix,” but the task force has “deep concerns about specific metros, of course in Florida, and spreading epidemic in California into the Central Valley.” A White House spokesperson said Birx’s comments were in line with Trump’s briefing remarks on Wednesday. “This doesn’t deviate from what the President said yesterday. The virus is still with us, we have some states and metros with significant outbreaks, and we must take this incredibly seriously,” deputy press secretary Judd Deere told CNN.  But Trump cherry-picked some of the more hopeful aspects of the pandemic in his briefings, and declined to appear alongside his top public health officials, telling reporters that appearing solo at the podium was a “very concise way of doing it.” With summer blockbusters pushing back their release dates because of coronavirus, AMC Theatres is delaying its opening once again.  The world's biggest movie theater chain is postponing the reopening of its US theaters to \"mid-to-late August,\" the company said on Thursday. AMC was set to have a phased reopening on July 15 with the hopes of being fully operational by July 24. That date was then pushed back to July 30 late last month.  \"This new timing reflects currently expected release dates for much anticipated blockbusters like Warner Bros.' Tenet and Disney's Mulan, as well as release dates for several other new movies coming to AMC's big screens,\" the company said in a release. Key senators and White House negotiators said Wednesday they had reached a deal on a key piece of their stimulus package, setting the stage for the release of their long-awaited full proposal. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told members he plans to unveil the package Thursday not as a single bill, but in pieces based on jurisdiction, GOP Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri told reporters.  The agreement marks progress in what has been an unwieldy several days on Capitol Hill for Republicans, with splits on policy becoming public between Republican senators and the White House — and among Senate Republicans themselves. What is expected in the plan: Senate Appropriations Chair Richard Shelby, an Alabama Republican, announced the \"fundamental agreement\" on the funding piece of the GOP plan, which would include $105 billion for schools and additional billions in funds for testing. Blunt, the chair of the health panel on the Appropriations Committee, said the appropriations agreement would include $105 billion for schools that would be divided as $70 billion for K-12, $30 billion for colleges and universities and $5 billion for governors to use at their discretion. Of the $70 billion, $35 billion would be for all schools on a per capita basis and the remaining amount would be directed toward schools reopening and the costs associated with that. Specific language will be included in the proposal to provide guidelines for how schools would qualify for the second pot of money, but the proposal would leave much of the decision making up to governors. Additionally, the agreement includes funds for testing — a major sticking point between White House negotiators and their Senate GOP counterparts. The topline number would be $25 billion, which would comprise $16 billion in new funds and a commitment from the administration to designate for use the $9 billion in leftover funds. Meadows said no final decisions had been made about what the GOP proposal would include on the extension of the federal enhancement of unemployment insurance or what has been decided on a payroll tax cut, which President Trump has made a priority in spite of resistance from a large number of Republican senators.

Four months after the Covid-19 pandemic ravaged the health of Americans, their economy and their labor market, the upswing in economic data is tapering off. A resurgence in infections and a rollback of reopening plans in several states is making it difficult for people to re-enter the labor force following the pandemic lockdown. Continued claims — which count people who have applied for benefits for at least two consecutive weeks — slipped to 16.2 million, down by more than 1 million from the week prior. Watch:  This might be the most obvious thing in the world, but parents need to come to grips with the fact that their kids probably aren't going to be in classrooms this fall. There will be exceptions, sure, in places where schools do open for normal hours or something close to it. There will be kids who go part-time (this is becoming known as the \"hybrid\" option). But it's becoming clear that a large portion of the country's kids won't be in class and parents need to start planning for that if they haven't already. Trump didn't mention his recent demand that US schools open this fall, Covid-be-damned, at his first briefing on the coronavirus since April. But he said Wednesday that he \"would like to see the schools open 100%\" — and then immediately pivoted to the economy, which is why he wants schools to reopen. As the Covid-19 surge continues, schools continue to announce plans for online-only learning this fall. On Tuesday, it was Fairfax and Loudoun counties in Virginia and Montgomery County in Maryland that did an abrupt and simultaneous about-face to say public school students would not be brought back in-person. Together those comprise a major chunk of the DC suburbs. Kids in the nation's capital won't know until July 31 if the city will offer any kind of in-person education this fall or whether it will be online. On Wednesday, it was Clark County in Nevada reversing course from a hybrid model to distance learning. It was Seattle, too. In Kansas, the state board of education, split down the middle, blocked the governor's attempt to go online only to start the year, an exception proving the new rule. Last week, it was California, where Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom declared schools couldn't offer in-person instruction until they met certain Covid criteria. Right now that ban applies to 90% of the state's kids. There may not be an exhaustive database of the country's 13,000 school district plans, but the snapshot at Education Week is pretty darn good (and maddening to read). It shows five of the nation's 10 largest districts will be distance learning this fall, which begins next month for most kids. Or not. Some districts don't have a start date. Others are delaying into September. New York City's mayor has pledged to implement a hybrid model, but details are still in flux and the state's governor must sign off. He won't do that until August. Read the full analysis:  ##Schools## Miami Mayor Francis Suarez announced that the Florida city will increase its penalties for people not adhering to its mask mandate, raising the amount from $50 to $100 for first and second offenses. Violators could face arrest for third offenses.  “We want to make sure people follow the rules. We're seeing some early evidence that the mask-in-public rule is working and we want to make sure it's being adopted universally in our population,” Suarez said on CNN’s “New Day.” Suarez said that 39 officers this week will be dedicated solely to mask enforcement. “We want to make sure that we're able to continue these gains so that we don't have to take more dramatic measures,” he said.  Suarez said the situation in Miami has improved, so he isn't planning on implementing a stay-at-home order. “Just a few days ago, we were at 60 new cases per day. …We're down to 20 new cases a day, which means that the remediation efforts that we've taken, including the mask-in-public rule, are working,” Suarez said. “We're being patient and letting those remediation efforts take full effect before making any decisions,” he added.  Suarez said that delays in testing are leading to further coronavirus spread, particularly in large households, contradicting the President, who called testing “overrated.”  Watch:  ##Hotspots## ##Masks## It's Thursday morning in the US, where the number of total cases since the start of the pandemic is nearing 4 million, according to Johns Hopkins University's latest tally. If you're just reading in, here are the latest updates from around the country:  A vaccine deal: The US government has reached a $1.95 billion agreement with the drug company Pfizer to produce at least 100 million doses of a Covid-19 vaccine. Depending on when one is made available, the doses could start shipping out as early as the last quarter of this year.\nStaggering new numbers: In the past two weeks, the US recorded more than 915,000 new cases of coronavirus — that's more than the cases reported across the country for the whole month of June. The US also recorded its second straight day with more than 1,000 Covid-19 deaths.\nGOP's stimulus plans: White House negotiators say they've reached a deal on the general aspects of a new stimulus package, which means we could see the GOP's long-awaited full proposal soon. The plan will feature $105 billion for schools and additional billions in coronavirus response funds. \nInside the hotspots: In Florida, 53 hospitals have reached ICU capacity and show zero ICU beds available for the second day in a row. In Texas, the state broke its record for hospitalizations two days in a row this week, with 10,848 patients reported Tuesday and 10,893 reported Wednesday. Meanwhile, California surpassed New York with the most cases in the nation this week.  Hear more: ##Hotspots## ##Stimulus## ##Vaccines##    Americans have long had a love affair with Italy. This summer, that relationship is on hiatus, and Italy is feeling the heartache. According to the Italian government's statistics bureau, 6 million US travelers choose Italy for their vacation each year. Lured by timeless dolce vita, dramatic coastal beach settings, food and wine, history and so much more, US travelers will largely have to do without this year. As Europe transitions out of the emergency phase of the Covid-19 pandemic, border closures remain in place with only a handful of non-EU nations added to a \"safe\" list for essential travel only. Italy hasn't adopted the EU's recommended list of safe countries, and the US -- deemed a high risk because of a surge in coronavirus cases -- wasn't even on the list to begin with. Read more here. In Florida, 53 hospitals have reached ICU capacity and have no beds available for the second day in a row, according to data released by the Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA).  Eight of the hospitals at capacity are in Miami-Dade County, AHCA data shows. Another 44 hospitals have 10% or less ICU capacity available. More than 5,000 people have died because of the virus in Florida. Despite the crisis, the state's Republican Governor Ron DeSantis has announced that all public schools will reopen by August. DeSantis has also resisted calls to consider a mask mandate. ##Hotspots## With the US economy wavering as coronavirus cases spiral out of control, millions of renters across the country who are already behind on payments are increasingly concerned about the threat of evictions as the new rent month approaches. Jose Palma, a construction worker in Richmond, California, is one of them. The 40-year-old father of two just started getting regular hours after months out of work and owes four months of back rent on a three-bedroom unit on top of his August rent -- a bill of about $8,000, he says. \"There isn't a solution right now,\" said Palma. \"I owe rent. I have to put food on the table for my kids. It's stressful and all very hard.\" Housing instability has been a looming crisis in the US against the backdrop of the pandemic as the economic fallout coupled with the absence of a broad federal response has left renters vulnerable. And this week, more than 25 million people will lose the extra $600 weekly federal unemployment benefits boost, cutting out a crucial lifeline many renters have depended on to make ends meet.

Aquino was unable to get into Canada in early April, in spite of what Poon insists was overwhelming support in favor of their case as a couple -- shared bills, a mortgage on a condo containing Poon and Aquino's names, and a common law relationship according to Canada's definition.  Aquino arrived in Canada only to be forced to turn around and head back to Ireland. They have been apart ever since. The couple are part of a growing group of people around the world demanding that travel exemptions be made for them as the pandemic continues. The group's message is often delivered with the tag lines: \"love is essential\" and \"love is not tourism.\" They are an impressive, growing group on social media, committed to being heard and ultimately allowed to travel to be together again. Separated, binational couples -- some married, many not -- are fighting for their right to travel. They're fighting for love. Read the full story here. Hong Kong recorded 118 new cases of coronavirus on Thursday, all of which except seven cases were locally transmitted, according to a daily health briefing. Among the 111 local cases, around half are untraceable. An additional death was also recorded Thursday afternoon, bringing Hong Kong’s Covid-19 death toll to 15. Many of the local infections are related to family and workplace transmissions, including several restaurant outbreaks. Officials in the city have struggled to contain the city's third wave. Dr. Chui Tak-yi, the under secretary of food and health, said the government was still closely monitoring the situation to see whether it needed to tighten the social distancing measures, which include restrictions for restaurants. \"The epidemic situation in Hong Kong remains severe. From July 16-22, there were 543 confirmed cases, of which 481 are locally transmitted. Compared to last week, 256 cases were recorded from July 9-15, of which 207 were locally transmitted. The epidemic trend is still increasing,\" he said.  \"We have to still be very cautious about potential further increase in the outbreak,\" he added. France will distribute 40 million face masks to the country's poorest citizens, Health Minister Olivier Véran told television station France 2 on Wednesday. The free and reusable masks will be sent to “7 million French people on the threshold of poverty,” Véran said.  Those receiving state financial aid to help pay for medical expenses will get the masks, Véran added, noting that the face coverings are washable and can be worn up to 30 times. They will be posted directly to those who qualify for them, he said. Mask-wearing was made compulsory in all indoor public spaces in France on Monday. French police officers have the power to fine citizens €135 ($156) for not abiding by the rules. ##Masks## President Donald Trump's new political self-preservation effort to show he has a grip on a pandemic that is killing hundreds of Americans every day is being exposed by his refusal to share the stage with scientific experts -- or the facts. On a day that laid bare his refashioned campaign strategy, Trump hammered out a tough law-and-order push, escalated a Cold War with China and tried to show he is managing the fight against Covid-19 after weeks of neglect. The President has been flailing for days, as a vicious surge in infections races across the sunbelt, caused in part by governors who heeded his calls to open states before the pathogen was suppressed. With one poll showing him down 20 points to Democratic presumptive nominee Joe Biden on who can best handle the situation, Trump has taken the rare step of performing a partial reversal -- on the wearing of masks -- though he is still reluctant to model one in public. He also decided that outright denial of the worst public health crisis in 100 years was not working and has returned to the White House briefing room to spin the disaster as best he can.

The figure is the highest on record for the Japanese capital, as the Olympic host city marks exactly a year before the rescheduled 2020 games are due to begin.  Koike said about 5,000 virus tests had been conducted across the city. She added that 60% of the positive cases are in people aged in their 20s and 30s. The latest Tokyo case numbers come a day after Japan reported 796 new cases on Wednesday, another record increase for the country as a whole. The coronavirus pandemic is \"wreaking havoc\" across Arab countries, the United Nations (UN) warned Thursday. The UN said cases were rising alarmingly across the region, with 55 million people at risk from the virus and in need of humanitarian assistance. Among this group are 26 million refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs), ​the UN said. The organization's Secretary-General António Guterres said in a statement that the pandemic had caused \"an estimated 5% contraction in the [region's] economy,\" with \"one-quarter of the population falling into poverty [and] 17 million jobs lost when 14.3 million adults of working age were already unemployed.\"  But Guterres said the crisis could \"also be a moment for resolving long-standing conflicts and addressing structural weaknesses\" and urged Arab countries to take rapid measures to face the crisis. \"Now is the time to take immediate measures to slow the spread of the disease, end the conflict and meet the urgent needs of the most vulnerable,\" he said. Guterres called for greater investment in \"universal health and education; social protection floors; and technology,\" with a particular focus on ensuring greater rights for women and more opportunities for the region's young people. \"Together, we can turn a crisis into an opportunity. It will be good for the region -- and good for our world,\" he said. The UK is preparing for multiple crises this winter, with the possibility of a second coronavirus spike, a flu outbreak, winter flooding and disruptions caused by the Brexit transition threatening to overwhelm national resources, a senior military official has said. “The [Covid-19] crisis is still very firmly with us and definitely as we look towards the winter now we … can see the normal flu season [approaching], we’re obviously transitioning out of the EU and we [will] have our normal floods,\" Lt. Gen. Douglas Chalmers, the Ministry of Defence’s head of military strategy and operations unit, said Wednesday. Chalmers was giving evidence before the UK House of Lords Public Services Committee. He confirmed that the army was working with the UK Joint Biosecurity Centre and government officials to develop a new contingency plan.  “We’re looking very heavily about how we do winter preparedness,\" he said. According to Chalmers, the army has been ordered by the prime minister’s office to develop a new contingency plan by the end of August.  “Number 10 has been very clear those ... exercises need to be done by the end of August in order that we can learn from them and then act on some of those elements that have been brought forward,” he said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has struck an optimistic tone when discussing the coming winter in public speeches. The UK leader announced a further easing of England's lockdown restrictions last week and said his government was \"hoping for the best, but planning for the worst.\" Meanwhile, the UK and the European Union appear to have made little progress so far in negotiations over their future relationship. South Korea has fallen into recession as the coronavirus pandemic takes a toll on all of the world’s major economies.  The Asian economy shrank 3.3% in the April-to-June period compared to a quarter prior, the Bank of Korea announced Thursday. It marked a second straight quarter of declines.  “While the recovery is already underway, it is likely to be slow going in the months ahead as the external environment only improves gradually,” wrote Alex Holmes, Asia economist for Capital Economics, in a research note. He noted that the drop in exports was the largest since 1963. \n“We don’t think it will be until next year that output regains its pre-crisis level.” Major world economies are struggling as the pandemic cripples industry and forces people to stay in their homes. Japan entered recession earlier this year — that country was already struggling before the outbreak because of a sales tax hike and the aftermath of a powerful typhoon. China’s economy, meanwhile, averted recession by growing last quarter. But the data still suggested that the recovery is slow, and that people are still nervous about leaving their homes. n the past two weeks, the US recorded more than 915,000 new cases of coronavirus -- that's more than the cases reported across the country for the whole month of June. The staggering number signals the US is still far from containing the virus, which is running rampant across American communities, overwhelming hospitals and testing labs. The spread has promised a bleak outlook for the months ahead, according to both health officials and the President. And experts have highlighted the actual number of infections is likely much higher than the reported cases. That comes as some US leaders have now admitted parts of the country reopened too soon. And as they did, residents were too quick to jump back to old habits: crowding bars, packing beaches on hot summer days, holding barbeques and spending holidays with friends. The surge in new cases across the South and Southwest has now been linked back to Americans' travel around Memorial Day and reopenings, White House coronavirus response coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx said Wednesday.

It was the first time Europe's leaders had seen each other face to face since the pandemic swept across the continent, shredding the European Union and causing untold pain and economic suffering, followed in most quarters by a recovery unlike anything experienced in the United States.  With 27 different agendas, it was a model of how to deal with a critical issue of money. Late on Monday, there was unanimity on the largest financial project ever attempted on the continent -- a total recovery package of $858 billion.  Many of the rifts, between rich and poor nations, those with true democracies and others verging on autocracies, were papered over. But in the end, in a model that should be examined closely as Washington strives desperately to work toward similar compromises, this one worked.

For the second day in a row, the US recorded more than 1,000 deaths in 24 hours, with  authorities reporting 1,195 new deaths on Wednesday. In total, there have been at least 3,970,906 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the US, while at least 143,190 people have died in the US from the virus.  The totals include cases from all 50 states, the District of Columbia and other U.S. territories, as well as repatriated cases.  For regular updates follow CNN’s map, which is refreshed every 15 mins:  ##Hotspots## Japan has again broken its record for new Covid-19 cases detected on a single day with 796 new cases found on Wednesday, according to its Health Ministry. Hard-hit Tokyo confirmed 238 cases on Wednesday. The total number of Covid-19 cases in Japan is now 27,741, including 712 cases diagnosed on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. One further death was recorded in Japan on Wednesday, bringing the country’s death toll to 1,003. On Tuesday night, President Donald Trump, in his first coronavirus briefing in several months, delivered a sober assessment of the fight against Covid-19 -- acknowledging that \"it will probably unfortunately get worse before it gets better\" and even offering a sort-of endorsement for mask-wearing.  At just over 30 minutes, the briefing was far shorter than the rollicking (and rambling) updates Trump was providing on the virus earlier in the year. And Trump himself was significantly more disciplined, largely sticking to prepared remarks and avoiding long asides in which he cast blame on everyone but himself for the current coronavirus state of affairs. \"Trump's press conference today marks a change in tone and a more disciplined and realistic approach,\" tweeted Republican strategist Matt Mackowiak. \"It will be a good message for the public and he will benefit from it politically. Welcome news.\" Um, no. If there is anything we have learned -- or should have learned -- about Donald Trump over these past five-ish years, it's that that there is no \"new\" Trump, no version 2.0, no new leaf to turn over. There is just Trump. He has been this same person -- bullying, blaming, convinced of his own brilliance, willing to bend and break facts for his own purposes -- his entire adult life. He may be able to subsume those natural characteristics for a day or even a week. But they will come back out -- sooner rather than later. They always, always do. We've been down this road before. Like, a lot of times. Read more here: The coronavirus pandemic will cause Australia’s GDP to fall by 4.75% in the fiscal year 2020-1, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said today. Inflated welfare programs and plummeting tax receipts are the cause of the dip in the country’s GDP, according to Treasury, with the country’s official unemployment rate forecast to rise to 9.25%, Frydenberg said. The Australian government says it has spent $117 billion (AUD $164 billion) on welfare, wage support, and economic stimulus measures since the pandemic began. Frydenberg on Thursday said that spending has prevented the loss of around 700,000 jobs. Australia’s gross debt will rise to $608 billion (AUD $851.9 billion), over a third of the country's GDP, according to Treasury. The 2020-1 budget will fall $131 billion (AUD$184.5 billion) into deficit, despite a pre-Covid projection of a AUD $5 billion budget surplus for the fiscal year.  “These are harsh numbers,” Frydenberg said on Thursday. This year’s budget deficit as a portion of GDP is the highest since World War II. The Trump administration announced Wednesday that it is sending $5 billion to nursing homes and state veterans’ homes to fight the growing coronavirus epidemic.  The money can be used to hire additional staff, implement infection control, increase testing and provide additional services, such as technology to allow residents to connect with their families. The infusion comes from the provider relief fund contained in the $2 trillion coronavirus relief package that the US Congress passed in late March. It’s in addition to the $4.9 billion nursing homes are receiving to offset revenue losses and to respond to the pandemic. Nursing home staff must complete an online training program for a facility to receive the new funds. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will also start requiring nursing homes in states with a 5% or greater coronavirus positivity rate to test all staff each week. This was previously a recommendation.  The administration announced last week that it is distributing rapid testing devices to nursing homes, which had complained that they don’t have the money to conduct so many tests. More than 15,000 devices will be deployed in coming months, with more than 600 shipping this week. The American Health Care Association and National Center for Assisted Living (AHCA/NCAL) said Wednesday that the increased funds are “a significant step forward,” but more is needed, especially in light of the surge of cases around the country.  “It is equally important for Congress to provide an additional $100 billion for the HHS Provider Relief Fund, which is accessible to all health care providers impacted by COVID-19,” said CEO Mark Parkinson. Argentina saw another record daily increase of new coronavirus cases Wednesday, according to its Health Ministry. The ministry reported 5,782 newly confirmed cases, topping Tuesday's record of 5,344 new cases. Argentina's total confirmed cases stands at 141,900. The ministry also reported 98 new deaths from the virus in the past 24 hours, bringing its death toll to 2,588. ##Hotspots## Brazil's interim health minister said Wednesday the coronavirus situation seems \"under control,\" despite the country reporting a record number of new cases Wednesday. In a press conference before the country's official daily Covid-19 numbers were released, interim Health Minister Eduardo Pazuello said, \"The scenario seems to me to be under control,\" but recognized there are still \"increasing cases\" and claimed the increase was because of the weather.  \"It is partly due to winter, of the social change in winter, and this causes the contamination to increase,\" he said. There has previously been speculation that warmer weather would lessen the spread, specifically from US President Donald Trump early in the pandemic. However, health experts have said warmer weather is unlikely to stop the spread of Covid-19. “Climate only would become an important seasonal factor in controlling COVID-19 once a large proportion of people within a given community are immune or resistant to infection,” Francis Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, said in a blog post in early June, citing experts in infectious disease transmission and climate modeling. Pazuello also said he was hopeful about the health system's capacity now that they have learned more from the outbreak. \"We have a real learning curve, we understand how to do it. Collapse situations have already occurred in the north and northeast, and today, the south and southeast of the country have an organized medical structure. We are in a position to give a more effective response and to not let the system collapse,\" he said. The Health Ministry released Brazil's daily coronavirus numbers shortly after the press conference, reporting 67,860 newly confirmed cases, the country's highest daily toll since the outbreak began. The ministry also added 1,284 new deaths.  Brazil's total number of Covid-19 cases is 2,227,514 and 82,771 total deaths. ##Hotspots## Administration officials were alerted tonight that a cafeteria employee on the White House grounds has tested positive for coronavirus, according to an email viewed by CNN.  Ike’s Eatery -- located in the Executive Office building -- and the cafeteria in the New Executive Office Building have both been temporarily closed, though the email cautioned that risk of transmission is low due to precautions like gloves and masks.  Those facilities are separate from the West Wing mess, but dozens of West Wing staffers walk to Ike’s for meals.  “There is no reason for panic or alarm,” the email reads.   The email says they conducted contact tracing and claim no executive office staff need to quarantine due to exposure.  Mexico's Health Ministry reported 6,019 new Covid-19 cases Wednesday, bringing the country's total to 362,274. Mexico has consistently reported 5,000 cases or more every day for the past eight days.  The ministry also reported 790 new deaths from the virus, bringing its death toll to 41,190. Mexico holds the fourth highest death toll from the virus worldwide, trailing the UK where the death toll is 45,586, according to Johns Hopkins University. In a snippet of an interview set to air later Wednesday night, President Trump said he would either take a coronavirus vaccine first or last, but lamented that, “either way I lose on that, right?” “You know the way it works,” Trump said, in a clip that aired on Fox News. “If I’m the first one, they’ll say ‘he’s so selfish that he wanted to get the vaccine first,’ and then other people would say ‘hey, that is a very brave thing to do.’ I would absolutely, if they want to me to, if they thought it was right, I would take it first or I’d take it last.” “You do know if I take it first, I’ll be – either way I lose on that, right?” Trump continued. “If I take it first. And if I don't take it, he doesn't believe in the program.” ##Vaccines##", "Section": "world", "Writers": ["Ben Westcott", "Brad Lendon", "Ed Upright", "Meg Wagner", "Melissa Macaya"], "URL": "https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/coronavirus-pandemic-07-23-20-intl/index.html", "MainKeyWord": "Hong Kong", "AdditionalKeyWord": "Southeast Asia", "Source": "CNN"}
