The $1 trillion programme includes maritime, rail and road projects in Asia, Africa, and Europe.Ties had been strained between the two countries since Najib, a close Beijing ally, lost power, and Mahathir suspended a series of Chinese-financed projects amid concerns the terms were unfair to Malaysia.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "URL": "https://mb.com.ph/2019/04/20/malaysia-revives-massive-china-backed-project/", "MainKeyWord": "China", "AdditionalKeyWord": "Malaysia", "Source": "MB"}
