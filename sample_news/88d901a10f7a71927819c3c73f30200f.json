Avian influenza, also called avian flu or bird flu, is an illness that usually affects only birds.   There are many different strains of avian flu: 16 H subtypes and 9 N subtypes. Only those labeled H5, H7 and H10 have caused deaths in humans. The most commonly seen and most deadly form of the virus is called \"Influenza A (H5N1),\" or the \"H5N1 virus.\" Diagnosis/Treatment Most cases of human bird flu infections are due to contact with infected poultry or surfaces that are contaminated with infected bird excretions: saliva, nasal secretions or feces.  Symptoms of avian flu include fever, cough, sore throat and sometimes severe respiratory diseases and pneumonia.   The CDC recommends oral oseltamivir (brand name: Tamiflu), inhaled zanamivir (brand name: Relenza) and intravenous permavir (brand name: Rapivab) for the treatment of human illness associated with avian flu.
