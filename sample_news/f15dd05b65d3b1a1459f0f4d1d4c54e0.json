Children watch the solar eclipse through a dark glass in Kathmandu, Nepal. A man uses solar glasses to look at the partial eclipse near the Forbidden City in Beijing. The \"ring of fire\" is seen from Leiyang, China. The ring of fire is visible during an eclipse when the moon is closer to the sun than the Earth, allowing the outer edge of the sun to appear around the moon. The 2017 solar eclipse observed from the United States did not produce a ring of fire because the moon was closer to the earth than the sun. A girl observes the eclipse on the Mahanakhon Skywalk Glass Tray at the King Power Mahanakhon building in Bangkok, Thailand. A man observes the partial eclipse in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.
