HBIS currently has 50 million tonnes of annual steelmaking capacity and the purchase would lift it above Japan’s Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp to become the world’s third-largest steelmaker, according to data from the World Steel Association’s website.“This project will seize the chance of fast economic development and firm steel demand in Southeast Asia,” HBIS said in its statement.HBIS started to acquire assets overseas in 2016 when Beijing launched its supply-side reform to clamp down excessive capacity in the steel industry, forcing companies to look outside the country for production growth.The company bought Smederevo Steel for 46 million euros ($52.58 million) in April 2016 and transformed it into HBIS Group Serbia Iron and Steel.By the end of 2018, HBIS has invested in more than 70 companies across 30 countries, with total assets exceeding $50 billion, the company said in its statement.The deal with Tata Steel is expected to be completed in three to four months, subject to regulatory approvals, the companies said.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "URL": "https://mb.com.ph/2019/01/29/chinas-hbis-to-buy-southeast-asian-holdings-from-tata-steel-pushes-expansion-in-ph/", "MainKeyWord": "China", "AdditionalKeyWord": "Southeast Asia", "Source": "MB"}
