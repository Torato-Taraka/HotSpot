Current ITLOS president Paik Jin-hyun also attended, although neither jurist mentioned any plans for Vietnamese legal action.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "URL": "https://mb.com.ph/2019/11/06/vietnam-mulls-legal-action-over-south-china-sea-dispute/", "MainKeyWord": "China", "AdditionalKeyWord": "viet Nam", "Source": "MB"}
