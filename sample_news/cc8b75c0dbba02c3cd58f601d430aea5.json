Uldarico Garbanzos, police chief here.“We want them to focus on anti-criminalities in their respective districts of assignment,” said Garbanzos.The movements were partly done to strengthen efficiency and proficiency of station commanders in their performance. Garbanzos noted how the previous commanders also served in concurrent capacity with certain departments of the Iloilo City police.Garbanzos said the new station commanders are on top of overseeing the management and not multi-task which affects performance.Garbanzos has ordered police to beef up deployment in key convergence areas for the Holy Week.As stricter guidelines are again being implemented due to rising cases of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), Garbanzos assured all police units here will strictly monitor if there are violations.Garbanzos particularly noted that cops will monitor any breach in COVID-19 protocols,  including illegal cockfighting activities, which the national government task force banned last March 20. Days after the ban, a cockfighting match was held in Lapuz here.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "URL": "https://mb.com.ph/2021/03/25/4-new-police-station-commanders-installed-in-iloilo-city/", "MainKeyWord": "Hong Kong", "AdditionalKeyWord": "viet Nam", "Source": "MB"}
