2018-06-17,Malaysia power shift hits China infrastructure drive,"by agence france-pressemalaysia was once a loyal partner in china's globe-spanning infrastructure drive but a new government is now pledging to review beijing-backed projects, threatening key links in the much-vaunted initiative. kuala lumpur's previous regime, led by scandal-mired najib razak, had warm ties with china and signed a string of deals for beijing-funded projects, including a major rail link and a deep-sea port. but the long-ruling coalition was unexpectedly turfed out of power last month by voters disgusted at allegations of corruption and angered at rising living costs. critics say many agreements lacked transparency, fuelling suspicions they were struck in exchange for help in paying off debts from a financial scandal which ultimately helped bring down najib's regime. the new government, led by political heavyweight mahathir mohamad, has pledged to review chinese deals seen as dubious, calling into question malaysia's status as one of beijing's most cooperative partners in its infrastructure push. china's ambitious initiative to revive ancient silk road trading routes with a global network of ports, roads and railways — dubbed ""one belt, one road"" — was launched in 2013 and is the economic crown jewel of president xi jinping's presidency. malaysia, along with beijing ally cambodia, were seen as bright spots in southeast asia, with projects in other countries often facing problems, from land acquisition to drawn-out negotiations with governments. ""malaysia under najib moved quickly to approve and implement projects,"" murray hiebert, a senior associate from think-tank the center for strategic and international studies, told afp. chinese foreign direct investment into malaysia stood at just 0. 8 percent of total net fdi inflows in 2008, but that figure had risen to 14. 4 percent by 2016, according to a study from singapore's iseas-yusof ishak institute. however, hiebert said it was ""widely assumed"" that malaysia was striking quick deals with china in the hope of getting help to cover debts from sovereign wealth fund 1mdb. najib and his cronies were accused of stealing huge sums of public money from the investment vehicle in a massive fraud.  public disgust at the allegations — denied by najib and 1mdb — helped topple his government. – beijing's plans derailed? –malaysia's first change of government in six decades has left najib facing a potential jail term — and appears to have already unsettled beijing's plans in the country. new prime minister mahathir has announced a planned high-speed rail link between kuala lumpur and neighbouring singapore will not go ahead as he seeks to reduce the country's huge national debt. the project was in its early stages and had not yet received any chinese funding as part of ""one belt, one road"". but chinese companies were favoured to build part of the line, which would have constituted a link in a high-speed route from china's yunnan province to trading hub singapore, along which chinese goods could have been transported for export. work has already started in malaysia on another line seen as part of that route, and which had received chinese funding — the $14-billion east coast rail link, running from close to the thai border to a port near kuala lumpur. mahathir has said that agreement is now being renegotiated. other chinese-funded initiatives include a deep-sea port in malacca, near important shipping routes, and an enormous industrial park. it is not clear yet which projects will be changed or cancelled but experts believe axing some will be positive. alex holmes, asia economist for capital economics, backed cancelling some initiatives, citing ""malaysia's weak fiscal position and that some of the projects are of dubious economic value"". the chinese foreign ministry did not respond to request for comment. but a recent commentary in china's global times, a nationalist state-run tabloid, warned mahathir if he damaged the interests of chinese companies, they had the right to seek compensation. ""the chinese government will also take concrete measures to safeguard the interests and rights of chinese enterprises,"" it said. adding to china's woes, mahathir has a clear preference for beijing's rival japan, and last week went to tokyo for his first foreign trip since taking office. during the visit, the 92-year-old signalled ties with beijing would cool: ""we will be friendly with china, but we do not want to be indebted to china.

2020-06-08,"5 things to know for June 8: George Floyd, police reform, coronavirus, economy, China","feeling hopeless? burnt out? you're not alone.  there are ways to combat that sinking feeling.  experts recommend talking it out, getting involved, and searching out the good among all the bad news.  here's what else you need to know to get up to speed and on with your day.   (you can also get ""5 things you need to know today"" delivered to your inbox daily.  sign up here. ) 1.  george floyd former minneapolis police officer derek chauvin will appear in court today exactly two weeks after george floyd's death.  chauvin was the officer filmed on video with his knee on floyd's neck before he died.  he's been charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.  also today, a third and final memorial service will be held for floyd in houston, where he grew up.  these key developments come after a second weekend of protests that have gone global, and grown to encompass more issues of systemic racism and police brutality.  in the uk, protesters toppled a statue of 17th-century slave trader edward colston, echoing several instances in the us where confederate monuments have been defaced, removed or designated for removal.  in brazil, protesters gathered in support of black lives matter, and to protest president jair bolsonaro's government, including its handling of the coronavirus pandemic.  2.  police reform  nine members of the minneapolis city council say they intend to defund and dismantle the city's police department.  council president lisa bender says they may shift police funding toward community-based strategies instead, and discuss how to eventually replace the current police force -- though bender stressed that is ""not in the short term. "" the nationwide spread of anti-racist protests have led to calls to defund or outright abolish police departments, and some cities are considering other changes.  in new york city, mayor bill de blasio says the city will move some of its funding from the new york police department to youth and social services.  last week, los angeles mayor eric garcetti agreed to slash between $100 million to $150 million from the los angeles police department's proposed $1. 86 billion budget.  3.  coronavirus  the us government's current supply of remdesivir, the only drug known to work against covid-19, will run out at the end of the month according to a us department of health and human services official.  gilead sciences, the company that makes the drug, is ramping up to make more, but it's unclear how much will be available this summer.  in the long term, the company plans to have more than 500,000 treatment courses available by october, and more than a million by december. though it's not a cure, remdesivir has been shown to reduce hospital stays for some covid-19 patients.  meanwhile, the global coronavirus death toll passed 400,000 this weekend, a sobering reminder that, despite waves of reopenings, the pandemic is an ongoing threat.  4.  economy employers added 3. 1 million jobs in may, giving an unexpected boost to a battered labor market.  but state and local governments are still cutting jobs, which could kill any real economic momentum.  among the growth last month, these two levels of government actually slashed more than half a million jobs.  one analytics firm predicts 3 million more state and local jobs could be at risk in coming months, including first responders and in areas like social services, sanitation, health care, education and municipal services like libraries and parks.  and while the economy might be doing better now, there may be more bad news around the corner.  economists believe a second wave of infections could deaden a rebound and put the american economy in new danger.  5.  south china sea maritime and military experts are worried that china is adopting increasingly forceful tactics in the south china sea.  the asia maritime transparency institute revealed chinese and malaysian ships were locked in a high-stakes standoff in the highly-contested area earlier this year.  beijing claims it was conducting ""normal activities in waters under chinese jurisdiction,"" but chinese vessels have been accused for years of hounding countries who try to explore in the areas of the south china sea that china claims as its own.  the malaysia standoff was also one among many confrontational moves from the chinese government in the region this year.  the amti says these incidents could lead to larger conflicts with other powers in the area, including malaysia or indonesia.  breakfast browse ufc champion conor mcgregor is retiring  at least, for now.  (he made similar announcements in 2016 and 2019. )   a famed treasure chest said to contain gold and jewels has finally been found in the rocky mountains  and it actually did contain gold and jewels!    these seven jobs are making the biggest return in the recovering pandemic economy  construction workers, laundry workers, janitors and dentists are all back on the job.     the golden gate bridge has been 'singing' recently.  here's why.   chalk it up to aerodynamics -- and a key new addition.   today's number 2. 6 million that's how many black-owned small businesses there are in the united states, according to the census bureau.  digital search and download data shows the worldwide protests have led to rising interest﻿ in supporting black businesses.   today's quote ""for those of you who feel invisible: please know that your story matters.  your ideas matter.  your experiences matter.  your vision for what our world can and should be matters. ""   former first lady michelle obama, in a virtual commencement speech to 2020 high school and college graduates.  today's weather and finally rock solid  all of this treasure chest talk has us thinking about diamonds.  here's how they go from dull rock to brilliant showpiece.

2020-06-21,Why this Japan-China island dispute could be Asia's next military flashpoint,"while china is engaged in a tense border standoff with india high in the himalayas, a small group of islands thousands of miles away could be another military tinderbox waiting to explode.  both tokyo and beijing claim the uninhabited islands, known as the senkakus in japan and the diaoyus in china, as their own, but japan has administered them since 1972.   tensions over the rocky chain, 1,200 miles (1,900 kilometers) southwest of tokyo, have simmered for years, and with claims over them dating back hundreds of years, neither japan nor china is likely to back down over territory considered a national birthright in both capitals.  in that respect, the islands are not unlike the rocky heights of the himalayas, where decades of tension on an ill-defined border between the territories of china and india erupted monday night, precipitating a clash that cost the lives of at least 20 indian troops.  the fighting, though deadly, was relatively confined -- and the two sides have talked down the tensions in the days since.  but an unexpected flare-up in the senkaku/diaoyus could trigger a military confrontation between china and the united states.  that's because the united states has a mutual defense treaty with japan.  if japanese territory is attacked by a foreign power, the united states is obligated to defend it.  fears of a possible confrontation were heightened last week with the announcement from the japanese coastguard that chinese government ships had been spotted in the waters close to senakaku/diaoyu islands every day since mid-april, setting a new record for the number of consecutive days.   by friday, those sightings had reached 67 days in a row.   taking unyielding stances in response to the increased chinese presence, yoshihide suga, japan's chief cabinet secretary, reasserted tokyo's resolve at a news conference last wednesday.   ""the senkaku islands are under our control and are unquestionably our territory historically and under international law.  it is extremely serious that these activities continue.  we will respond to the chinese side firmly and calmly,"" suga said.  in a statement friday, china's foreign ministry echoed that japanese government's sentiments, from the reverse perspective.    ""the diaoyu island and its affiliated islands are an inherent part of china's territory, and it is our inherent right to carry out patrols and law enforcement activities in these waters. "" similar comments were recently published in china's state-run global times newspaper.  the report, titled ""japanese conservatives disrupt recovering china-japan ties by hyping diaoyu islands dispute,"" criticized attempts underway in japan's okinawa prefecture to change the administration of the islands, noting it could do serious harm to japan-china relations.  on its surface, the move, brought forward by the city council of ishigaki, where the islands are administered, seems fairly innocuous.  according to japan's asahi shimbun, the council wants to decouple the islands from the populated parts of ishigaki island to streamline administrative practices.  but in the resolution before the ishigaki city council, the city ""asserts the islands are part of japanese territory. "" it's the kind of language that rankles in beijing.  ""changing the administrative designation at this time can only make the dispute more complicated and bring more risks of a crisis,"" li haidong, a professor at the institute of international relations of the china foreign affairs university, told the global times.  the vote in ishigaki is expected at monday's council meeting.  before the past week, the most recent ""crisis"" over the islands occurred in 2012.  that year, japan nationalized the then-privately owned islands to ward off a planned sale to tokyo's then-governor, a hardline nationalist who was reportedly hoping to develop the islands.  the plan sparked massive and highly unusual street protests across china, amid a groundswell of nationalist sentiment.  demonstrations turned violent as protesters hurled debris at the japanese embassy in beijing, ransacked japanese stores and restaurants and overturned japanese cars.  in a stark illustration of how the islands are seared into the chinese consciousness, one chinese man was beaten into a coma by his fellow countrymen simply because he was driving a toyota corolla.  a history of contention china says its claim to the islands extend back to 1400s, when they were used as a staging point for chinese fisherman.  however, japan says it saw no trace of chinese control of the islands in an 1885 survey, so it formally recognized them as japanese sovereign territory in 1895.  a group of settlers manufactured dried fish and collected feathers, with the islands having more than 200 inhabitants at one point, according to japan's foreign ministry.  japan then sold the islands in 1932 to descendants of the original settlers, but the factory failed around 1940 and the islands were eventually deserted.  the japanese surrender at the end of world war ii in 1945 only served to further cloud the issue.  the islands were administered by the us occupation force after the war.  but in 1972, washington returned them to japan as part of its withdrawal from okinawa.  self-governing taiwan, which beijing regards as a chinese province, also claims ownership of the chain.  and objections to the administrative reclassification of the islands in taiwan shows the depths to which the islands hook their respective claimants.  tsai wen-yi, a city councilman in taiwan's yilan county, said if the japanese change goes through, he'll organize a flotilla of fishing boats from the area to ""defend"" the islands from japan, according to a report from the taipei times.  defense of the senkaku/diaoyus has been a priority of the japan self-defense force (jsdf) in the past few years.  the council on foreign relations notes tokyo has established new military bases nearby to protect the islands.  the jsdf has also been building up its marines and drilling them on island warfare.  although the islands are uninhabited, there are economic interests involved, according to the cfr.  the islands ""have potential oil and natural gas reserves, are near prominent shipping routes, and are surrounded by rich fishing areas,"" it says.  what could trigger a clash  it all adds up to potential trouble, says william choong, a senior fellow at the iseas-yusof ishak institute in singapore ""compared to other flashpoints in the region -- the south china sea, taiwan, and north korea's weapons programs -- the east china sea combines a unique and combustible mix of history, honor and territory,"" choong wrote this month on the interpreter, the blog of the lowy institute in australia.  the asia maritime transparency initiative (amti) paints a scenario where something easily imaged -- the crew of a disabled ship or plane landing on one of the islands -- could turn into a serious international incident.  ""if chinese fishing crews, coast guardsmen, or military members landed on the senkakus, then the japan coast guard would no doubt seek to remove them in a law enforcement action.  but given that china does not recognize japan's claims, it is certainly possible that beijing could see this as an escalation, which might result in a substantial military response from china,"" the amti website says.  in the current climate in the indo-pacific, china is indicating it's ready to push its claims.  for example, in the south china sea, china has moved aircraft onto the man-made islands it has built up; it has sunk one vietnamese fishing boat and and rammed another; it has harassed a malaysian-chartered survey ship and sent one of its own into waters claimed by indonesia; in the past few weeks alone, chinese warplanes have been warned off by taiwanese fighters at least five times.  and in a ironic nod to what's going on in the east china sea, beijing reclassified its island claims in the south china sea, giving the spratly/nansha and paracel/xisha islands more prominent status in the country's governmental hierarchy.  then there's the india-china border in the himalayas.  before and after last monday's deadly clash, state-run chinese media was heavy with stories and images of the the new military hardware beijing could bring to bear in the mountains.  choong argues it would be unwise to think the senkakus/diaoyus aren't marked for similar attention at some point.  ""the question is not whether china, now the target of a full-court press by america, would want to challenge japan over the islands.  the question is when, and how? this is what keeps japanese (and american) policymakers awake at night,"" choong wrote.

""the growth in arms sales was expected and was driven by the implementation of new national major weapon programs, ongoing military operations in several countries and persistent regional tensions that are leading to an increased demand for weapons,"" the group said in its report.   arms producers in south korea, which increasingly supply the country's military, saw the largest percentage increase among developed countries.  the spending splurge reflects fears of a potential conflict with north korea.  sales by south korean firms increased by over 20% in 2016, to $8. 4 billion.  while consumer purchases are included in the sales figures, national governments are by far the largest purchasers of arms and weapons systems.  american firms remained at the top of the industry in 2016, with sales increasing by 4% to more than $217 billion.  that was 58% of the global total.   american defense firm lockheed martin -- the world's largest producer -- saw sales surge 11% in 2016, thanks to increased deliveries of its f-35 fighter and its acquisition of helicopter producer sikorsky.  aude fleurant, director of the arms and military expenditure program at sipri, said that u. s.  growth was likely to continue.  president trump wants to boost the pentagon's budget and refurbish the u. s.  nuclear arsenal.  related: 'slaughterbots' film shows potential horrors of killer drones sales by russian firms increased 3. 8% to $26. 6 billion, a slower expansion than in recent years.   moscow has boosted spending in order to overhaul its military capabilities, but procurement has slowed recently because of the country's strained finances.

2018-06-06,Malaysia draws China link to huge financial scandal,"by agence france-pressemalaysia's ousted leader has denied wrongdoing over a $2. 4 billion china-backed pipeline deal after the new government said the project was ""highly suspicious"" and linked it to a massive financial scandal. a company owned by malaysia's finance ministry signed the 9. 4-billion ringgit deal in 2016 for a chinese state-owned company to build a gas pipeline and an oil pipeline. najib razak — toppled in elections last month — was prime minister at the time, and battling allegations billions of dollars were looted from sovereign wealth fund 1mdb. the pipeline deal was one of a series of big-ticket, beijing-backed projects signed during najib's leadership, fuelling suspicions china was helping the scandal-mired leader pay off debts racked up by the stricken fund. malaysia's finance minister lim guan eng said tuesday that 8. 25 billion ringgit had already been drawn down by the chinese company building the pipelines. this amounted to almost 88 percent of the project value — yet only 13 percent of the work had been completed, he said in a statement. lim said he had instructed officials to file a report about the ""highly suspicious transactions"" with anti-corruption authorities and noted that the company behind the deal had links to a scandal-mired, former subsidiary of 1mdb. ""we have documents to prove. . .  it's all part of the 1mdb scam,"" the minister was cited as saying in the star newspaper. state-owned export-import bank of china provided 85 percent of the funding for the project with the rest required to be raised by issuing sukuk, or islamic bonds, lim said. najib insisted in a statement late tuesday there was no wrongdoing in the project, saying he and chinese premier li keqiang witnessed the signing of memoranda of understanding for the deal in beijing in 2017. the toppled leader, who has been questioned twice by graft investigators since losing power, said he was ""confident"" that all necessary ""procedures and laws have been complied with"" in the deal. he said ""great care"" should be taken ""when making such serious politically-motivated public allegations involving foreign state-owned companies as it may have a negative effect on foreign relations and international trade"". public disgust over allegations of corruption linked to najib and his cronies was a major factor in his surprise election loss last month to an alliance headed by mahathir mohamad.

2021-03-11,'Even prisoners get fresh air': Inside Australia's 'lucky dip' hotel quarantine system,"when my plane finally touched down in sydney, i was overwhelmed by a sense of disbelief.  after learning two of my family members had become seriously ill, i spent over six months planning what seemed like an impossible journey from europe home to australia.   a series of flight cancellations and hours spent reading horror stories from stranded citizens abroad who had lost jobs, visas and homes while waiting for a flight had left me convinced i would never make it.    taking advantage of its geographic isolation, australia closed its borders to international travelers early in the pandemic and barred most citizens from leaving.  under the current restrictions, only passport holders, permanent residents and those coming in on business or study exemptions are permitted to enter.    a hotel quarantine scheme run by state governments has been in place since march 2020, and it is widely regarded as playing a key role in australia's successful containment of covid-19.   crucially, australia's hotel quarantine system is also supported by a strictly enforced cap on weekly international arrivals.   the arrival caps, which currently allow 6,362 arrivals nationally per week, have created a bottleneck of stranded australians forced to compete for a limited number of seats.   in order to make flights commercially viable, airlines prioritize selling business and first-class tickets at a premium, and some passengers have reportedly paid upwards of $20,000 aud (roughly $16,000 usd) for a one-way business class ticket to fly into sydney from various european cities.   nearly 40,000 australians are still trying to return according to the department of foreign affairs and trade (dfat).   due to the cap on arrivals, i was one of just three people to secure an economy class seat on my flight from zurich to singapore, and one of a dozen or so to make it onward to sydney.   luck of the draw it doesn't matter if you flew first class, or economy like i did.  money and circumstance play almost no role in determining which hotel travelers will be assigned to.   everyone must pay $3,000 aud, (roughly $2,330 usd) per room, with an additional charge of $1,000 aud (roughly $775 usd) for every extra person, and $500 aud (roughly $390 usd) per child.   food is included in the quarantine fee, with passengers receiving three meals per day to their hotel room door.  whether you end up in a lavish suite with gourmet meals and harbor views, or a cramped, windowless room with inedible fare, all comes down to luck.  on arrival into sydney my flight was greeted by members of the state police, army, navy and air force, before everyone was loaded onto a bus without open windows.  after approximately an hour of waiting onboard, we drove off into the night, but were not told our final destination.   every passenger on my flight ended up quarantining at the sheraton grand hyde park sydney, a very comfortable five-star hotel offering city views.  like most urban hotels though, my room -- while luxurious -- did not have opening windows or a balcony, which meant i couldn't access fresh air for 14 days.   in recent months, breaches in australia's quarantine system in sydney, melbourne, brisbane, adelaide and perth have occurred, leading to a spate of infections among hotel staff, cleaners and security guards.  these have raised concerns over the lack of ventilation within city hotels, and the heightened risk that poses in terms of aerosol transmission.     in early february, there were two incidents of guest-to-guest transmission in hotels, after a woman in melbourne reportedly contracted the virus from a family located in a room across the hotel hallway, and in a separate incident, a traveler in sydney tested positive two days after leaving quarantine, indicating that he likely caught the virus during the final days of his stay, rather than it being a rare late-blooming infection.   considering these recent outbreaks, and how highly transmissible new strains entering the country, such as the b. 1. 1. 7 variant are, access to fresh air was the only thing i had hoped for in my hotel assignment.   when i asked guest services at the sheraton about the possibility of moving to a room with balcony access, i was advised it would cost an extra $400 aud per night to upgrade.   speaking with several other travelers who have gone through the quarantine system in sydney, i learned that charging a premium for rooms with access to fresh air was common practice among hotels, as a way to increase profit margins.   i contacted the marriott international, which owns the sheraton grand hotel, to ask about this practice, but received no response.   despite the lack of fresh air, my overall experience in quarantine was relatively positive.  the staff were kind, the room was comfortable and i was provided with a desk to work at.  other travelers i spoke to, however, were not as fortunate.   amelia seeto spent $28,500 aud (roughly $22,130 usd) on mandatory quarantine and flights for her family of four to get home to sydney from the uk.  despite traveling with two highly active toddlers, she says her and her husband were placed in a small room in sydney's mantra hotel, with no opening windows or a balcony.   ""the system is flawed and unfair,"" she said.  ""they put families in rooms that are substandard while the best rooms stay empty.  hotel management told me they had all these empty rooms on the top floors but we couldn't move there because everyone gets allocated to their floors. "" seeto says she tried to appeal to the new south wales police stationed at her hotel, who were in charge of approving any accommodation changes, to allow her family to move into a room with access to fresh air, but her requests were denied.   ""i was in a room with no balcony and two screen-free little boys who needed fresh air.  the nurses appealed to the police to move us and their claim was rejected twice,"" seeto said via phone.   anastasia aubert also traveled to sydney with a family of four in february, but unlike seeto, she said her experience was ""very positive,"" as her family were given a large apartment with two balconies at the meriton suites pitt street, which came with a full kitchen and laundry facilities.  the most common hotel quarantine complaints among other travelers i spoke with related to the lack of fresh air, suitable ventilation in rooms and the quality of the food being served.   anthony, who requested cnn only use his first name, quarantined at the novotel sydney central in december after flying to australia from new york.  he said via email that his hotel room was visibly dirty on arrival, and that the ventilation was so poor he had trouble breathing.   ""the air conditioning unit in my room had no fresh air provision, i looked into the ceiling and saw no ductwork connected.  i took out the filter and it was caked with dirt.  the condition of my room was unsanitary with urine on the toilet.  i had to clean the toilet and the air filter myself. ""   anthony says he requested to be moved to a room with an operable window or balcony after experiencing tightness in his chest from the lack of ventilation, and eventually his request was approved.  he was so disturbed by his overall experience though, that he says he wrote to australia's minister for health, greg hunt, and the new south wales ombudsman -- the state's watchdog tasked with addressing problems in government agencies -- to lodge a formal complaint.    ""the conditions of the hotel rooms do not comply with minimum international standards for detainees -- even prisoners get fresh air,"" anthony wrote in his letter, citing section 11(a) of the united nations standard minimum rules for the treatment of prisoners, which stipulates that prison windows ""shall be large enough to enable the prisoners to read or work by natural light, and constructed so they can allow the entrance of fresh air whether or not there is artificial ventilation. ""  the new south wales ombudsman was unable to investigate anthony's complaint however, as while the quarantine system is run by the state government, the ombudsman has no authority to investigate private businesses that are involved in running it.   cnn has reached out to novotel owner accor for a response to his claims.   professor jason monty, head of melbourne university's mechanical engineering department, has spent months analyzing airflow systems across medical wards in victoria, and is considered a leader in the study of how poor ventilation can influence aerosolized transmission of covid-19 particles.  monty said that from an infection-control standpoint, the ventilation in most city hotels is extremely poor, and that state governments should start investing in open-air quarantine facilities, such as the howard springs facility in the northern territory, which is a former gas plant workers' village now being used to house those returning from overseas.   ""hotels often have what's called positive pressure in their rooms, which means air is trying to get out because the ventilation system is weak,"" he said.   ""that air usually has two ways out: either through the door or through a window.  if you close the windows it only has one way out and that's through the door.  ""it's a gap in the system that we've been pushing pretty hard for the government to respond to since, june-july 2020,"" he added, referencing the recent cluster outbreaks in several hotel quarantine settings.    how other countries compare many countries have implemented enforced mandatory quarantine or self-isolation upon arrival since early on in the pandemic, however some are far stricter than others.   in south korea, travelers are required to self-quarantine for 14 days, but can do so in a private setting as long as it is deemed suitable by state authorities.  those who fail to organize appropriate accommodation are put into government-run facilities at their own expense.   hong kong tightened its already strict quarantine measures in december 2020.  incoming residents must now book a room and board for 21 days at one of 36 pre-approved hotels chosen by the government, one of the strictest quarantine measures in the world.  travelers are able to select an accommodation based on their budget/room preferences.    thailand, which has recently re-opened its borders to tourists willing to quarantine for 14 days, provides a long list of government-approved quarantine hotels that guests can stay in at their own expense.   the approved options are accessed via an online portal, and travelers can search for hotels based on budget, location, size and available in-house facilities.   all travelers -- including british citizens -- who arrive in england from ""high-risk"" coronavirus countries now have to quarantine in hotels for up to 10 days, but supervised departures from the rooms are permitted for fresh air.   like thailand, the uk government offers a list of approved options, however the cost of the hotel

2020-01-07,America's passport now as weak as Mexico's,"before covid-19 struck, the world was enjoying greater freedom of movement than at any time in history.  air traffic had been rising steadily for decades and the average passport-holder worldwide was enjoying visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to 107 global destinations.   and then came the travel bans.   the henley passport index, which periodically measures the world's most travel-friendly passports, has just released its third report of the new decade.   asian citizens continue to have the travel documents that open the most doors.  japan is top of the leaderboard, offering visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to 191 destinations around the world.   singapore is in second place (with a score of 190) and south korea ties with germany in third place (with a score of 189).   the standard ranking, however does not take temporary bans into account -- and that, says henley & partners in a release, is where the juiciest details lie: ""it is eye-opening to consider what travel freedom currently looks like for the holders of once-prestigious passports. "" last week, the eu released its list of the 14 countries whose residents would be allowed entry into bloc from july 1,  months after it shut its external borders in response to the outbreak of covid-19.   japan and south korea made the grade when it came to the eu's coronavirus-related health and safety criteria, as did australia and canada (in joint ninth place on the henley passport index).   however, notes henley & partner's, ""in a move perceived as a stinging rebuke for its poor handling of the pandemic,"" the united states was a notable exclusion, alongside brazil and russia.   the united states is currently placed seventh in official index, but under the current eu ban, americans have around the same level of travel freedom as citizens of mexico (no.  25 on henley passport index, with a score of 159) and uruguay (no.  28, with a score of 153).   likewise, brazil's absence from the list of countries welcomed by the european union means that, while its official henley ranking is no.  19, the current reality is that it ranks somewhere closer to paraguay (36th on the index, with a score of 142).   singapore, meanwhile, is at no.  2 on the henley passport index but its exclusion from the eu list means that its passport-holders currently have much less travel freedom than the other countries on the top podium: japan, south korea and germany.   christian h.  kaelin, chair of henley & partners and the inventor of the passport index concept, says the impact of the eu's recent decision will be far-reaching.  ""as we have already seen, the pandemic's impact on travel freedom has been more drastic and long-lasting than initially anticipated.  this latest decision by the eu indicates that there is more upheaval to come.

2021-02-23,February 24 coronavirus news,"the us department of veterans affairs has administered more than 2. 1 million covid-19 vaccine doses, dr.  richard stone, acting under secretary for health at the va, said during a senate hearing wednesday.  ""yesterday, as of feb.  23, va had administered well over 2. 1 million doses of the vaccines,"" stone said.  ""these include over 1. 1 million first doses to veterans and 484,000 doses – first and second doses – to va employees, which have inoculated well over 90% of our clinical staff. "" stone said that among enrolled veterans over 75, who are currently prioritized for vaccination, ""25% of white, 28% of hispanic and 30% of black veterans have been vaccinated. ""  he added that 73% of the total va workforce has received the vaccine.  stone said the agency has the capacity to deliver between 300,000 and 600,000 vaccine doses per week.  ""we were just called on the way over here to say that we would be getting about 500,000 doses this coming week,"" stone said.  ""we have seen a gradual increase, and we are very hopeful with the new vaccine that's coming on the market that we will continue to see increases, and the problems that we're having with the amount of vaccine will resolve itself over these next number of weeks. "" ##vaccines## a large study of people across england found strong antibody protection in people who got both doses of the pfizer/biontech vaccine – but people who had been infected and got just a single dose had even stronger responses.  the react-2 study by scientists at imperial college london found that three weeks after receiving the first dose of the pfizer/biontech vaccine, 84% of people under the age of 60 tested positive for antibodies against sars-cov2.  among those who had received one dose but had suspected or confirmed prior infection with covid-19, this rose to 90%.  ""we have found a really good response, measured by antibody prevalence, in those who have had two dose of the vaccine and those who have had one dose,"" helen ward, professor of public health at imperial college london, told reporters at a news conference.  ""i hope this will be used to encourage people get their second dose. "" ""there's clearly value in getting that first dose,"" added graham cooke, professor of infectious diseases at imperial college london.  ""we don't have enough data yet on the long-term protection of one dose. "" the study of 155,000 people tested between jan.  28 and feb.  8 covered 18,000 vaccinated people, including 13,000 who got the pfizer vaccine.  the findings paint a picture of which groups had been most affected by coronavirus during england's second wave.  infections were highest in people living in london (16. 9%).  more than 22% of people of black ethnicity appeared to have been infected and 20% of people of asian background had.  just 8. 5% of whites had evidence of having been infected.  concerns around vaccine confidence were also raised, being more common among younger people and black people.  reasons for low confidence included worries about pregnancy, allergies and fertility, the study found.   ##vaccines##  two separate teams of researchers say they have found a worrying new coronavirus variant in new york city and elsewhere in the northeast that carries mutations that help it evade the body's natural immune response – as well as the effects of monoclonal antibody treatments.  one of the mutations is the same concerning change seen in the variant first seen in south africa and known as b. 1. 351.  it appears to evade, somewhat, the body's response to vaccines, as well.  and it's becoming more common.  ""we observed a steady increase in the detection rate from late december to mid-february, with an alarming rise to 12. 7% in the past two weeks,"" one team, at columbia university medical center, write in a report that has yet to be published, although it is scheduled to appear in pre-print version this week.  they've named the most common variant b. 1. 526.  it appears in people affected in diverse neighborhoods of new york city, they said, and is ""scattered in the northeast. "" the mutation in this variant that most concerns researchers is called e484k and it gives the virus the ability to slip past some of the body's immune response, as well as the authorized monoclonal antibody treatments.  this mutation is popping up independently in many different cases but appears in one particular variant, as well – the one called b. 1. 526.  ""it is this novel variant that is surging, alarmingly, in our patient population over the past few weeks,"" the columbia team led by infectious disease specialist and aids researcher dr.  david ho, wrote.  but the e484k mutation is seen in at least 59 different lineages of coronavirus, they said – which means it is evolving independently across the nation and across the world in a phenomenon known as convergent evolution.  it may give the virus an advantage.   separately, a team at the california institute of technology said they developed a software tool that also spotted the rise of b. 1. 526 in new york.  ""it appears that the frequency of lineage b. 1. 526 has increased rapidly in new york,"" they wrote in a pre-print – a report that has not been peer-reviewed but has been posted online.  ##variants## about 66. 5 million doses of covid-19 vaccine have been administered in the united states, according to data published wednesday by the us centers for disease control and prevention.   the cdc reported that 66,464,947 total doses have been administered, about 75% of the 88,669,035 doses delivered.   that's about 1. 4 million more administered doses reported since yesterday, for a seven-day average of about 1. 5 million doses per day.   about 14% of the population — more than 45 million people — have now received at least one dose of vaccine and more than 6% of the population – about 20. 6 million people have been fully vaccinated with both shots, cdc data shows.   note: data published by the cdc may be delayed, and doses may not have been given on the day reported.  ##vaccines## alaska gov.  mike dunleavy tested positive for covid-19 wednesday, according to his office.   ""he is currently at home with mild covid-19 symptoms,"" the governor's office said in a statement.  dunleavy had been in quarantine since sunday when it was determined he was in close contact with another person who had a confirmed coronavirus case.   his initial test on sunday came back negative, but he remained in precautionary quarantine.  the governor's office said he was retested after he began to feel ill tuesday night.   because he has avoided close contacts since sunday, dunleavy's office said it is not believed that the governor could have spread the coronavirus to anyone else.  the covid-19 vaccination site at medgar evers college in brooklyn — one of the largest vaccination sites in new york state — opened today.  the college is set up to vaccinate 3,000 new yorkers a day.   cnn's alexandra field was on the ground answering your questions about the vaccine roll out.  watch more: us hospitals are projecting a significant revenue shortfall in 2021 due to the pandemic, according to a new report commissioned by the american hospital association.   in an optimistic scenario, hospitals and health systems could suffer a $53 billion loss in total revenue in 2021.  under a more pessimistic budget scenario, that revenue loss could total $122 billion this year.  the optimistic projection assumed that vaccine supply, distribution, and administration aren't delayed and residents continue to practice social distancing until herd immunity is achieved.   the pessimistic scenario, on the other hand, would be more likely to come true if vaccine supply and distribution are delayed and residents don't practice social distancing, both of which contribute to a cyclical rise in covid-19 cases and hospitalizations.  more insight: treating covid-19 patients is more expensive for hospitals, especially when they can't offset those costs with as much usual expected revenue from non-covid patients.  ""during the pandemic, people have put off needed care, in some cases to the detriment of their health,"" rick pollack, aha president and ceo, said in a news release.  ""in addition, the costs of labor and supplies have increased, adding to financial stress. "" hospitals aren't just plagued by decreased non-covid patient volume.  they also saw added expenses in many categories last year.  those costs included a 17% overall uptick in drug expenses per patient discharged and a 16% increase in purchased services per patient, which can include the cost of sterilization and maintaining safe spaces with covid-19 patients.  labor expenses were up 14%, due in part to hospitals needing to hire contract labor and give hazard pay to workers.  and supply expenses were up 13%, as hospitals needed to purchase personal protective equipment, as shortages of needed equipment led to increased prices.   the new projections come after an aha report last summer estimated that hospital revenues for 2020 would be down at least $323. 1 billion.  the johnson & johnson covid-19 vaccine seems to work better against the coronavirus variant first identified in south africa than data initially suggested.  the variant, which is thought to be more contagious, currently makes up the majority of cases in south africa and has been found in several countries, including in the united states.  according to a us food and drug administration's briefing document released wednesday, the vaccine showed a 64% efficacy rate in south africa.  that's seven points higher than what was reported in interim data released by the company in january.   since that time, johnson & johnson did additional sequencing and determined there were more cases that could be included in its analysis from south africa.  nearly 95% of the cases in the study in south africa came from the variant, according to the addendum to the analysis.   ""the fact that the numbers came up a little bit, once they fully analyzed the data from the time of the initial press release, shows that it's not that different against the south african variant,"" said dr.  philip grant, who was the lead investigator on the stanford university arm of the j&j vaccine trial.  ""i think it's going to have to be looked at more carefully, in terms of which vaccines are most effective in different locations. "" the vaccine has a 72% efficacy rate in the us and a more than 68% rate in brazil at protecting people from mild to severe/critical disease.   the vaccine offered nearly 86% protection against severe forms of the disease in the us, nearly 82% in south africa and nearly 88% in brazil.  experts have said variants may fuel a surge of cases in the us, and that's one reason why it's important to get as many people vaccinated as quickly as possible.  ##vaccines## moderna has designed an updated version of its covid-19 vaccine to help it combat the south africa coronavirus variant, the company announced wednesday.   initial doses have been shipped to the us national institutes of health for a clinical study.  the new vaccine, called mrna-1273. 351, will be evaluated as a booster shot for people who have already been vaccinated against coronavirus and as a primary vaccine for people who haven't had coronavirus and have yet to be vaccinated.  moderna said it will also evaluate a ""multivalent"" booster shot that combines the new vaccine formulation with the current vaccine.  additionally, the company said it has begun to test whether a third, lower dose of its current covid-19 vaccine can increase immunity against coronavirus variants of concern, with some study participants already getting third doses.  on monday, the us food and drug administration issued new guidance to vaccine makers to address the emergence of coronavirus variants.  the agency recommended that data from clinical immunogenicity studies be used to support any changes or updates to vaccines.  such studies would be smaller and could take less time than large-scale clinical trials.  ""it's going to be on the order of a few hundred individuals in terms of size and we'd expect that that might take a few months,"" dr.  peter marks, director of the fda's center for biologics evaluation and research, said during a call with reporters on monday.  moderna said it plans to ""evaluate immunogenicity and safety in participants"" consistent with the recently updated guidance.   ""we are moving quickly to test updates to the vaccines that address emerging variants of the virus in the clinic.  moderna is committed to making as many updates to our vaccine as necessary until the pandemic is under control.  we hope to demonstrate that booster doses, if necessary, can be done at lower dose levels, which will allow us to provide many more doses to the global community in late 2021 and 2022 if necessary,"" stephane bancel, moderna's ceo, said in a news release wednesday.  moderna did not say how long it expects the studies to take, or when the new vaccine would be available, if authorized.    ##vaccines## ##variants## moderna has shipped approximately 55 million covid-19 doses to the us to date, the company said wednesday.  an additional approximately 33 million doses have been produced, filled into vials and are in the final stages of production and testing before being released to the us, moderna said in a news release.  the company now plans to manufacture 700 million doses globally this year, an increase of 100 million doses.  in 2022, it says its global capacity will increase to approximately 1. 4 billion doses of covid-19 vaccine.  moderna said it is making new financial investments to achieve that increased capacity at manufacturing sites.  the influx of money will enable additional production of moderna's covid-19 vaccine and potential production of new versions of the vaccine that may be needed to combat coronavirus variants.  the company said it could potentially manufacture even more doses in 2022 if studies show new variant-based versions of the vaccine can be administered at lower dosages than the current vaccine.  ##vaccines## the white house officially announced it will continue the national emergency declared by the previous administration surrounding the covid-19 pandemic.   the national emergency was declared last year on march 13, 2020.  in a news release issued today, the white house said ""the covid-19 pandemic continues to cause significant risk to the public health and safety of the nation,"" adding that the declaration ""must continue in effect beyond march 1, 2021. ""  north carolina gov.  roy cooper said he will sign a new executive order that starts on friday that will ease some of the covid-19 restrictions that have been in place in the state since the beginning of the pandemic.   the new executive order lifts the modified stay-at-home order that requires people to stay in their residences and businesses to close to the public between 10 p. m.  and 5 a. m.  local time.  cooper and department of health and human services secretary dr.  mandy cohen said the statewide mask mandate remains in effect.  indoor gathering limits increase from 10 to 25, with the limit of 50 for outdoor gatherings remaining the same, the order said.  the curfew for alcohol sales for onsite consumption will now be from 9 p. m.  to 11 p. m.  under the new order.  the order also lightened capacity limits for event venues.  indoor venues that have a capacity over 5,000 can now allow 15% capacity as long as they follow additional safety measures.   previously, this limit was at 250 people, regardless of venue size.  outdoor venues can now have a capacity of 30%.  by the numbers: according to the state dashboard, 849,630 cases have been reported since the start of the pandemic.  there have also been 11,074 deaths reported in north carolina.  the dashboard showed that 2,180,655 doses of covid-19 vaccine have been administered in the state.   to note: these numbers were released by the state's public health agency and may not line up exactly in real-time with cnn's database drawn from johns hopkins university, the covid tracking project and the us centers for disease control and prevention.  ##restrictions## honduras authorized the emergency use of the russian sputnik v vaccine against covid-19, according to a report from the honduran health regulatory agency (arsa) on wednesday.   arsa detailed in a statement that the authorization was dated feb.  19 and was based on the consideration of the ""regulatory authorities of regional reference,"" as a measure to control the pandemic.  the russian direct investment fund (rdif), russia's sovereign wealth fund, announced that honduras is the 36th country to approve the use of the sputnik v vaccine.  ##vaccines## further delays in the delivery of astrazeneca vaccines are ""extremely frustrating,"" said belgian regional health minister wouter beke during a meeting of the flemish parliament wednesday afternoon.  ""there are doubts due to the lack of vaccine supply.  i share that annoyance with you with 200%,"" beke said.  ""that means that we constantly have to puzzle and re-puzzle.  that is extremely frustrating for those who have to try to do this again every day. "" beke said belgium only got 88,800 doses of the astrazeneca vaccine this week instead of the expected 114,716 doses.  ""next week: 21,600 instead of 19,167; and the week after we should get – but i'll see before we believe it – 127,200 instead of 33,984 deliveries,"" beke said.  the lack of supply this week will be made up for in future deliveries, beke said but there remains a structural shortage of 31,714 doses across belgium.  he added that the delay in vaccine deliveries is no reason to doubt the efficacy of the vaccine.   ##vaccines## white house press secretary jen psaki said the administration was ""surprised"" when johnson & johnson told them they were behind on manufacturing.  cnn has reported the initial number of doses was expected to be closer to 10 million, and covid-19 coordinator jeff zients said wednesday it would be between 3 and 4 million.  cnn's kaitlan collins pressed psaki on the amount of johnson & johnson vaccine that will be deployed next week, pending emergency use authorization from the food and drug administration.   ""we were surprised to learn that johnson & johnson was behind on their manufacturing.  as you noted, it was kind of reported earlier to be about 10 million and now it's more like 3 to 4 million doses that they would be ready to ship next week if they are moved through the fda process which is not yet concluded,"" psaki said.  she continued, ""we're going to continue to work with them on ensuring that that can be expedited. "" ##vaccines## watch:  são paulo, brazil, will begin a statewide curfew this friday, the state's governor, joão doria, announced today.  the curfew — which will run from 11 p. m.  until 5 a. m.  local time and will remain in place until march 14 — requires bars and restaurants to close and prohibits people from being out in the streets.   the decision is part of a bid to slow the spread of the coronavirus, which has led to record hospitalizations.  as of monday more than 6,400 patients were hospitalized in icus across the state, up from the previous record of 6,250 recorded last july.  ""it's a historic record since february last year when we had our first case of covid in brazil, here in the state of sao paulo,"" doria said.  the governor also said large gatherings will be prohibited at any time of day, and regulations will be enforced with fines.  the increase in hospitalizations is likely due to large gatherings and parties organized 10 days prior during carnival, the state's emergency covid-19 center coordinator, paulo menezes, said in a press conference.  menezes said a more contagious variant of the coronavirus might also have played a part.  correction: an earlier version of this post included the wrong end date for são paulo's curfew.  the curfew will remain in place until march 14.  ##restrictions## ##hotspots## france's health minister announced that the city of dunkirk in northern france and its surrounding region, an area of 250,000 people, will be put under a new weekend lockdown starting this friday night.  the minister said the measure was taken as dunkirk is facing a surge of covid-19 cases, due to the spread of the british variant.   french health minister olivier véran said that one in 100 of the population of dunkirk is infected by the virus every week.  under the lockdown, only essential shopping and travel will be allowed.  the lockdown will be in effect every weekend until further notice.  the government took a similar decision on monday for the southern region of the alpes-maritimes where a partial lockdown is going to be put in place between the coastal towns of menton and theoule over the next two weekends in an effort to curb a surge in covid-19 cases and the spread of new variants.  ##variants## the biotechnology company novavax expects to apply for emergency use authorization for its covid-19 vaccine sometime in the second quarter of 2021, dr.  gregory glenn, president of research and development for novavax, said during a live q&a with the washington post on wednesday.  ""last week we finished recruiting 30,000 people in the us and mexico and we're expecting that result right at the beginning maybe of quarter two – so pretty soon – and shortly thereafter we would be filing for what we call eua or emergency use authorization in the us,"" glenn said.   ""so, we're thinking quarter two and then deployment could come fairly quickly,"" glenn said.  ""the vaccine we expect to be deployed widely. "" the company announced monday that it has completed enrollment of its prevent-19 trial, a phase 3 study of its covid-19 vaccine in the united states and mexico.  the trial enrolled 30,000 volunteers across 118 locations.  ##vaccines## johnson & johnson initially was behind on manufacturing its covid-19 vaccine when the biden administration took office last month, but it's getting better, a white house official said wednesday.  ""when we got here five weeks ago, we learned that j&j was behind on manufacturing and our team has been working with them since, and i think they're in a better place now,"" jeff zients, white house covid-19 response coordinator, said during a news briefing.  ""we've helped them with equipment and raw materials, which i think is helping to increase greater capacity,"" he said, adding that the initial production ramp was ""slower than we'd like. "" ""it was disappointing when we arrived,"" zients said.  ""i think the progress is real and we look forward to continuing to work with the company to accelerate their delivery and their capacity. "" what happens next: pending an emergency use authorization from the us food and drug administration, zients said the biden administration is preparing rollout plans for 3-4 million doses of the johnson & johnson covid-19 vaccine next week.  zients said states will receive around 2 million doses of the vaccine, and the remaining doses will be allocated to pharmacies and community health centers.  ##vaccines##  dr.  anthony fauci said he hopes that therapeutic approaches to treating long covid could come from medications already available, but the newly announced initiative to study on long covid may provide answers.  the aim is to learn more about how the virus may lead to widespread and long-lasting symptoms and to develop ways to treat or prevent them.  initially, the initiative will look at areas including the spectrum of recovery across the population and what the underlying biological cause of prolonged symptoms.   ""it's very difficult to treat something when you don't know what the target of the treatment is.  and that's the reason why it's extremely important to take a look at these individuals, not only the scope of this, and not only the, you know, depth and breadth of the symptoms, but also to try and have some correlate that actually is a path of physiological correlate,"" fauci said at a briefing from the white house covid-19 response team on wednesday.   ""once we get that, an important part of this is, as i mentioned, would be to design therapeutic approaches, hopefully by medications that we already have, we just need to know how to use them,"" fauci added.  long covid: a study published friday found that 30% of people with covid-19 continue to have symptoms up to nine months after initial infection.  the most commons symptoms were fatigue and loss of taste or smell, although some reported cough, trouble breathing, muscle aches and brain fog.   nearly a third reported worse quality of life compared to before getting sick, and some said they had trouble performing at least one usual activity, such as daily chores.  dr.  fauci discusses 'long covid':  multiple senate sources familiar with the matter said arguments were made on both sides this morning on the $15 federal minimum wage hike – and whether it fits within the rules of budget reconciliation.   the senate's parliamentarian, elizabeth macdonough, has not yet ruled on the matter, and it's not clear yet when she will.  democrats and the white house are attempting to push biden's $1. 9 trillion covid relief package through the senate by reconciliation, meaning the bill could pass with a simple majority of 51 votes and not require 60 votes to overcome a filibuster.  reconciliation, however, has a strict set of rules, and provisions have to undergo a review of whether it has an impact on the budget and not just an ""incidental"" one.  ##us stimulus## switzerland will move forward with a phased reopening of its economy and society which will see some coronavirus restrictions lifted on march 1, the swiss federal government announced during a news conference wednesday.  all shops in switzerland will reopen on march 1, with restrictions limiting the number of customers.  museums, libraries, zoological and botanical gardens, sports, and outdoor leisure facilities will also reopen.  most sporting and cultural activities for people under 20 will also resume.  people in switzerland will also get the green-light to meet outdoors in groups of more than 15 people beginning march 1.  swiss president guy parmelin said outdoor dining could resume on march 22 rather than the previously planned date of april 1, if the situation permits.   restaurants in switzerland have been closed since dec.  22, with non-essential shops shuttered since jan.  18.   parmelin said the gradual reopening will be ""a source of dissatisfaction for some,"" adding that while the ""impatience that some people have is understandable,"" the situation in switzerland ""remains very fragile due to new variants of the virus which continue to progress.  the swiss government said it would reassess the situation on march 12.   alain berset, a member of the swiss federal council, tweeted wednesday that the government has taken ""a calculated risk: for society, for the economy and especially for young people, particularly touched by this crisis. "" on wednesday, at least 1,343 new coronavirus cases were recorded by the federal office for public health.   switzerland has recorded at least 552,698 coronavirus cases and at least 9,256 deaths since the pandemic began.  ##restrictions## the international air transport association (iata) is calling on governments around the world to start issuing digital vaccine credentials to support a successful restart of international travel once borders re-open.  ""it's absolutely critical that we start issuing digital vaccine credentials,"" iata's head of airport passenger & security products, alan murray hayden, said on wednesday.  ""many airports are really operating at capacity at the moment, even though they are only carrying 10% of the normal volumes of passengers.  and that's simply because of the amount of time it currently takes to check all the bits of paper that a passenger needs to have.  it takes so much time that we simply won't be able to reopen in a sustainable way,"" he added.  iata's travel pass, an app developed by the international air transport association directly connects passengers with their covid-19 test results from the labs, is one option airlines are piloting to process covid data digitally.   iata is scheduling to fully roll out its travel pass at the end of march, which is currently being trialed with 20 airlines around the world.   ""governments have been introducing quarantines; however vaccine and testing is the way in which we're going to exit from the requirements for people to quarantine and the iata travel pass will enable people to do that,"" hayden said.  iata warned that the industry is still suffering from the current restrictions still in place for international travelers predicting that airlines will burn through up to $95 billion during 2021.  the supply of covid-19 vaccine doses being allocated to states and retail pharmacies is increasing, jeff zients, white house covid-19 response coordinator, said on wednesday.   ""from 8. 6 million doses when we took office to 14. 5 million doses this week, that's an increase of vaccine allocations to states of nearly 70% during the biden-harris administration,"" zients said during a white house news briefing.  ""in this week, we will increase the allocation to pharmacies to 2. 1 million doses,"" zients said.  ""so, with 14. 5 million doses allocated to states, tribes and territories, and 2. 1 million through the federal retail pharmacy program, we've nearly doubled weekly supply of doses in just five weeks. "" ##vaccines##  pending an emergency use authorization from the us food and drug administration, white house covid coordinator jeff zients said the biden administration is preparing rollout plans for 3-4 million doses of the johnson & johnson covid-19 vaccine next week.   ""while we await the fda decision, we want the american people to know that we're doing the work so that if the eua is issued, we will waste no time getting this lifesaving vaccine into the arms of americans,"" zients said at wednesday's virtual covid briefing.   ""if authorized, we are ready to roll out this vaccine without delay,"" zients said, noting that this vaccine's distribution will mirror the current allocations process across jurisdictions, pharmacies, and community health centers.   after initially telling the nation's governors to expect 2 million doses next week, zients said wednesday that the administration anticipates allocating ""3 to 4 million doses of johnson & johnson vaccine next week. "" johnson & johnson has announced it aims to deliver 20 million doses by the end of march, but, zients said, ""we're working with the company to accelerate the pace and timeframe by which they deliver the full 100 million doses, which is required by contract by the end of june. ""  some context: johnson & johnson's single-shot coronavirus vaccine appears to be safe, according to a 62-page briefing document released by the us food and drug administration on wednesday.   data on the vaccine will be discussed in a meeting of the fda's vaccines and related biological products advisory committee on friday.  that committee will decide whether to recommend that the fda issue an eua for the vaccine.  ##vaccines## watch:  white house covid-19 response coordinatorjeff zients said today during a covid press briefing that the biden administration will deliver more than 25 million masks across the country.  ""the masks will be available at more than 1,300 community health centers and at 60,000 food pantries nationwide.  any american who needs a mask can walk into these health centers or food pantries and pick up high-quality, american-made masks. ""  zients said the cloth masks will be available at no cost, will come in children's and adult sizes, and can be washed for reuse.  see the announcement:  there's new evidence that connects testing positive for covid-19 antibodies from a prior infection with a significantly lower risk of becoming infected again in the future.    a study published in the journal jama internal medicine on wednesday found that people who tested positive for covid-19 antibodies were at a decreased risk of coronavirus infection compared with those who tested negative for antibodies.    ""the results from the study are basically a 10-fold reduction, but i would have caveats around that.  in other words, it could be an overestimate of the reduction, it could be an underestimate of the reduction,"" said dr.  douglas lowy, principal deputy director of the national cancer institute, who was an author of the study.   ""to me, the big message is – there's a reduction,"" he said.  ""the main takeaway is that being antibody positive after natural infection is associated with partial protection against a new infection. ""  the researchers – from the national cancer institute and the companies labcorp, quest diagnostics, aetion inc.  and healthverity – examined data on more than 3. 2 million people in the united states who had completed a covid-19 antibody test last year between january and august.  among those tested, 11. 6% tested positive for covid-19 antibodies and 88. 3% tested negative.   in follow-up data, the researchers found that only 0. 3% of those who tested positive for covid-19 antibodies ended up testing positive for coronavirus infection later, beyond 90 days.  whereas, 3% of those with negative covid-19 antibody test results were later diagnosed with coronavirus infection during that same time period.   overall, the study is observational and it suggests there is an association between positive covid-19 antibody test results and a lower risk of infection some 90 days later – but more research is needed to determine a causal relationship and for how long protection from antibodies may last.   lowy said that more research is also needed to determine the risk of reinfection from one of the emerging coronavirus variants.  he also emphasized that people who have tested positive for antibodies should still get vaccinated against covid-19.     two studies published wednesday by the us centers for disease control and prevention linked covid-19 outbreaks over the summer in chicago and hawaii to exercise facilities.  the reports suggest that mask use may be a key mitigation strategy in these settings.  in chicago, 60% of people who attended in-person fitness classes between august 24 and september 1 tested positive for covid-19.  another 7% of attendees reported symptoms consistent with the disease.   while some mitigation measures were in place at the facility – including required temperature checks and symptom screenings upon entry – removal of masks was permitted during exercise, according to the report by researchers from chicago and the cdc.  in hawaii, 21 cases were linked to a fitness instructor who tested positive for covid-19 on july 1, said the report by researchers from hawaii and the cdc.  about two days before experiencing symptoms, the fitness instructor led a yoga class for 27 people while wearing a mask.  there were no reported cases among these participants.  a few hours before symptom onset, the same instructor led a stationary cycling class for 10 people, none of whom wore a mask.  all participants later tested positive for covid-19, including a second fitness instructor linked to additional cases.  according to the first report, ""the increased respiratory exertion that occurs in the enclosed spaces of indoor exercise facilities facilitates transmission"" of the virus.   even when spaced 6 feet apart, the cdc recommends the use of a mask to reduce transmission in fitness facilities.  they also say that facilities should improve ventilation and encourage patrons and staff to follow proper quarantine and isolation protocol after potential exposure to covid-19 or the onset of symptoms.   the johnson & johnson vaccine might prevent covid-19 infection without symptoms starting at about four weeks, according to the us food and drug administration's briefing document on the vaccine released wednesday.  earlier studies from the us centers for disease control and prevention have shown that most coronavirus cases are spread by people without symptoms.  if a vaccine prevented asymptomatic infection, it might help reduce opportunities to transmit the disease – not just keep the vaccinated from getting sick.  the clinical trial looked for asymptomatic infections among the volunteers at several points after they had been vaccinated.  the trial found that the vaccine had ""modest"" protection against asymptomatic infection from day one through day 29, but after that, it seemed to offer protection.   when the volunteers were checked at 71 days after they had gotten the vaccine, it seemed about 74% effective against asymptomatic infections.   the document says these findings should be ""interpreted with caution"" and additional research is needed, since the follow-up time is limited and the number of volunteers in this sample was comparatively small, so ""definitive conclusions cannot be drawn at this time. "" ##vaccines## an ensemble forecast published wednesday by the us centers for disease control and prevention now projects there will be 526,000 to 548,000 coronavirus deaths in the united states by march 20.   notably, this forecast extends a week beyond the previous forecast, but the projected number of deaths has dropped.  normally, each new cdc forecast projects a greater number of total deaths over a longer period of time.  the previous ensemble forecast, published february 17, projected up to 559,000 coronavirus deaths by march 13.   at least 502,698 people have already died from covid-19 in the united states, according to data compiled by johns hopkins university.  cnn's john king reviews the latest us covid-19 numbers:  another sign of stiff republican opposition to biden's covid-19 relief plan: at a closed-door meeting today, one house gop member after another railed against the measure, according to reps.  doug lamborn and tom reed.  no one spoke in favor of it.  reed, a member of the bipartisan problem solvers caucus, told me that he will vote against the plan.   ""there's so many issues with the bill that the popularity of it is gonna wear off,"" reed said.  republican leaders see opposition to the bill as key to unifying their party after a divisive few months of intra-party squabbling.   ##us stimulus## johnson & johnson's single-shot coronavirus vaccine appears to be safe, according to a 62-page briefing document released by the us food and drug administration on wednesday.  an analysis of safety data through january – which included more than 40,000 adults – ""supported a favorable safety profile with no specific safety concerns identified that would preclude issuance of an eua,"" the fda noted in the document.  the fda advisory committee noted in the briefing document that the most common side effects associated with the vaccine were pain at the injection site, headache, fatigue and muscle pain.  there appeared to be more incidents related to blood clotting and ringing in the ears among those who received the vaccine compared with those who didn't, but the fda notes, ""data at this time are insufficient to determine a causal relationship between these events and the vaccine. "" overall, non-fatal serious adverse events were infrequent, according to the briefing document, and there were no reported cases of anaphylaxis following vaccination.  as of feb.  5, there were seven covid-19-related deaths in the placebo group and no covid-19-related deaths in the vaccine group.  nineteen deaths total had been reported as of jan.  22 – three among those who received the vaccine and 16 among those who received a placebo.  then from jan.  22 to feb.  5, according to the document, an additional six deaths occurred – two in the vaccine group and four in the placebo group.   data on the vaccine will be discussed in a meeting of the fda's vaccines and related biological products advisory committee on friday.  the committee will decide whether to recommend that the fda issue an emergency use authorization, or eua, for the johnson & johnson vaccine.  ##vaccines## a combined flu and covid-19 vaccination is a future possibility, a leading british virologist testified wednesday.   wendy barclay, head of the department of infectious disease at imperial college london, told uk lawmakers: ""[the] most likely scenario is that a combination vaccine would be given going forwards in the future, which would combine influenza, with an updated sars-cov-2. "" ""but that really is crystal ball gazing to an extent.  i think the next year will really tell us much more about the epidemiology of how this new coronavirus [variant] will settle down, and how quickly it might mutate and necessitate vaccine updates, and how long the immunity for the current vaccines that we're going to rollout to a large proportion of the uk population will last, and therefore how necessary it will be to give boosters. "" ##vaccines##   johnson & johnson says that it has four million doses of its covid-19 vaccine ready to ship ""immediately"" once it receives emergency use authorization, which could happen this week.  in an analysis just released, the us food and drug administration said the company's single-dose vaccine has met the requirements for emergency use authorization.  however, despite the excitement and anticipation, there are still several steps johnson & johnson has to go through before the vaccine will be available.  here's what happens next: the fda's vaccines and related biological products advisory committee meets on friday to review data on the vaccine and decide whether to recommend it for emergency use authorization in adults 18 and older.  once the vaccine is authorized, the us centers for disease control and prevention advisory committee on immunization practices, or acip, makes recommendations to the cdc on how the vaccine should be used, such as among what age groups and on what type of schedule.  an emergency meeting of acip is scheduled for feb.  28 and march 1.  typically, the cdc director accepts the committee's recommendation.  shortly after that, the vaccine can be distributed, and can start going into arms.  what everyone wants to know is where the federal government will send those doses, and who they'll be steered toward.  ""we're hoping that acip will provide some guidance on the most effective use of the j&j one dose vaccine,"" claire hannan, executive director of the association of immunization managers, wrote in an email to cnn on tuesday.  ""states are looking for guidance for use of the vaccine in populations which might really benefit from the one dose series complete, such as transient populations,"" hannan said.  ""we aren't hearing much on this. "" you can read more about the johnson & johnson vaccine here.  ##vaccines## in an analysis released wednesday, the us food and drug administration said johnson & johnson's single-dose covid-19 vaccine has met the requirements for emergency use authorization.  the efficacy of the johnson & johnson vaccine against moderate to severe/critical covid-19 across all geographic areas was 66. 9% at least 14 days after the single dose vaccination, and 66. 1% at least 28 days after vaccination, a new analysis meant to brief the fda's vaccines and related biological products advisory committee said.   ""there were no specific safety concerns identified in subgroup analyses by age, race, ethnicity, medical comorbidities, or prior sars-cov-2 infection,"" the analysis said.  in a briefing document, the fda said that it has reviewed the data for the vaccine and has determined that it is ""consistent with the recommendations set forth in fda's guidance emergency use authorization for vaccines to prevent covid-19. "" an independent group of fda advisers, the vaccines and related biological products advisory committee, will consider the documents and make a recommendation about whether the covid-19 vaccination should be authorized.   the committee meets on friday.  watch more: ##vaccines## the national institutes of health announced a new initiative to study long covid, and ""to identify the causes and ultimately the means of prevention and treatment of individuals who have been sickened by covid-19, but don't recover fully over a period of a few weeks,"" a statement from nih director dr.  francis collins said.  ""while still being defined, these effects can be collectively referred to as post-acute sequelae of sars-cov-2 infection (pasc).  we do not know yet the magnitude of the problem, but given the number of individuals of all ages who have been or will be infected with sars-cov-2, the coronavirus that causes covid-19, the public health impact could be profound,"" said the statement, released tuesday.   in december, nih was provided with $1. 5 billion over four years to support research into the long-term health consequences of coronavirus infection, and on wednesday it announced the first research opportunities for the pasc initiative.  about the initiative: the aim is to learn more about how the virus may lead to widespread and long-lasting symptoms and to develop ways to treat or prevent them.  initially, the initiative will look at areas including the spectrum of recovery across the population and what the underlying biological cause of prolonged symptoms.   initial research will support ongoing and new research studies, as well as the creation of core resources.   ""through the pasc initiative, we now ask the patient, medical, and scientific communities to come together to help us understand the long-term effects of sars-cov-2 infection, and how we may be able to prevent and treat these effects moving forward,"" collins said.  a study published friday found that 30% of people with covid-19 continue to have symptoms up to nine months after initial infection.  the most commons symptoms were fatigue and loss of taste or smell, although some reported cough, trouble breathing, muscle aches and brain fog.  nearly a third reported worse quality of life compared to before getting sick, and some said they had trouble performing at least one usual activity, such as daily chores.  france is ""likely"" to alter its guidance and allow people aged 65 and over to get the astrazeneca vaccine, a spokesman for france's health ministry told cnn wednesday.   france had previously said astrazeneca's covid-19 vaccine should only be administered to people aged under 65, citing a lack of clinical data on its efficacy for older people.  ""this opinion is likely to change in the near future based on the results of clinical trials on this age group,"" the spokesman said.  ""a scottish study on the efficacy of the astrazeneca vaccine seems to indicate very positive results,"" he added.   a row erupted across europe earlier in the year after germany's vaccine commission, quickly joined by a handful of other countries, said the astrazeneca vaccine shouldn't be given to the over-65s, citing insufficient data.  the decisions came amid an ongoing dispute between the european union and astrazeneca over delays to the delivery of its coronavirus vaccine to the bloc.  the european drug regulator approved the use of the vaccine for all ages, and the company has said its data supported its use for over 65s.  but french president emmanuel macron went as far as suggesting the vaccine was ""quasi-ineffective"" in people over 65, a comment that drew sharp criticism from many experts.  france's reassessment follows italy's decision tuesday to raise the age limit for astrazeneca's vaccine by ten years, now approving it for use on people up to 65.   early data on the pfizer and oxford-astrazeneca shots in scotland showed that by the fourth week after the initial dose, both vaccines had a significant impact on hospital admissions.  the pfizer vaccine reduced the risk of hospital admission from covid-19 by up to 85%, and the oxford-astrazeneca vaccine reduced the risk of hospitalization by up to 94%.  the study is the first to look at the two vaccines' effect on preventing severe illness resulting in hospitalization across an entire country, with previous efficacy results coming from clinical trials.  unlike france and italy, scotland does not have an age cap on who the astrazeneca vaccines is recommended for.   eleftheria vasileiou, data analyst at the university of edinburgh's usher institute, noted during a monday press briefing on the study that in scotland the ""pfizer vaccine is given to all age groups but it's not been given terribly much to those people who are over 75"".  she said in scotland the astrazeneca vaccine has been primarily going to people who are over 65.   by targeting vaccine distribution to more specific vulnerable populations, us states could have the opportunity to save thousands of lives and prevent even more hospitalizations, according to a new analysis shared exclusively with cnn.    health care data science firm cogitativo analyzed thousands of health insurance claims and county-level demographics in california to assess the most predictive and discriminative factors leading to poor outcomes following covid-19 infection.   by combining federal vaccination priority group recommendations with localized measures of the effects of factors such as air quality and access to fresh food, the company was able to more precisely pinpoint the most vulnerable individuals in the state and the counties where they live.  as demand for vaccine continues to outpace supply, there's still not sufficient supply to cover everyone within the top priority groups.   according to the analysis, dozens of counties in california would lack sufficient doses to serve the most vulnerable people in the state under federal guidance alone.  los angeles county, for example, would have a deficit of nearly 405,000 doses.   expanding those findings to the 10 largest states shows that about a third of counties would be lacking doses relative to the number of most vulnerable residents -- and about 5 million doses could make a deeper impact in the fight against covid-19 if reallocated to a different county.   ""without a surgical approach to distributing the vaccine, more americans -- often in communities of color and rural areas -- risk being left behind,"" cogitativo ceo gary velasquez told cnn.   ""the key is to use a combination of real clinical data and social determinants of health to surgically assess who is at greatest risk.  this approach can help states avoid acute deficits in certain counties. "" ##vaccines## the uk will prioritise giving covid-19 vaccinations to people with learning disabilities, moving 150,000 people up the queue after weeks of public pressure to include them in the rollout sooner.  new guidance from the joint committee on vaccinations and immunisation (jcvi), which advises the government on its vaccine rollout, places people with severe and profound learning disabilities into priority group six.  ""i have heard first-hand how tough this pandemic has been for people with learning disabilities and their families.  we are determined those more at risk from covid should be vaccinated as soon as possible,"" minister for care helen whately said in a statement sent to cnn.  ""following the jcvi's updated advice and to make this process simpler and faster, we will be inviting everyone for vaccination who is on their gp's learning disability register.  this will mean those who are at a higher risk from the virus can get the protection they need. "" radio dj jo whiley has led a public campaign to have people with learning disabilities prioritised for vaccines, detailing the struggles of her sister who contracted the virus after an outbreak at her care home.  a study by the office for national statistics found that people with learning disabilities are more likely to die from covid-19.  priority group six, where those people have now been placed, consists of at-risk adults aged 16 to 65 who have a clinical condition that may make them more susceptible to catching the virus.  spain's prime minister has said he expects the country's number of covid-19 vaccine doses to quadruple in the second quarter of the year.   pedro sanchez told parliament that the government was committed to achieving a vaccination target of 70% of the population by the end of the summer.   the government has ordered 126 million doses of different vaccines -- more than 52 million from pfizer/biontech, more than 31 million from astrazeneca, 23. 5 million from curevac, about 21 million from johnson & johnson and eight million from moderna.  but spain's vaccination program has been affected by winter weather and a shortage of supply.  so far 3. 16 million doses have been administered and 1. 2 million people have received two doses.   sanchez was addressing lawmakers on the country's state of alarm, which is due to run through early may in an effort to limit transmission of the virus by restricting movement and imposing curfews.   some opposition parties have called for it to be lifted sooner, but sanchez rejected the demands, noting that the relaxation of restrictions around christmas had contributed to a ""third wave"" of the pandemic in much of europe.  ghana has become the first country to receive covid-19 vaccines through the world health organization's covax program on wednesday, a joint statement issued by unicef ghana and who ghana said.  the shipment, consisting of 600,000 doses of the astrazeneca vaccines, arrived at 7 a. m.  local time wednesday on an emirates flight at kotoka international airport, in ghana's capital accra.  the minister for health-designate, kwaku agyeman-manu, led a government delegation to receive the consignment.  the purpose of the covax scheme is to buy coronavirus vaccines in bulk and send them to poorer nations that can't compete with wealthy countries in securing contracts with the major drug companies.  as the plane carrying the vaccines landed, state-run ghana broadcasting corporation journalist abdul hayi-moomen declared: ""the flight carrying the vaccines that we so much look forward to receiving, i believe hope has arrived. "" the vaccines were produced by the serum institute of india, in the indian city of pune, and are part of the first wave of covid-19 vaccines headed to low and middle-income countries, the joint statement added.  ""today marks the historic moment for which we have been planning and working so hard,"" said unicef executive director henrietta fore.  ""with the first shipment of doses, we can make good on the promise of the covax facility to ensure people from less wealthy countries are not left behind in the race for life-saving vaccines. "" the philippines has offered to allow thousands of health care workers to take jobs in the uk and germany if the countries agree to donate covid-19 vaccine doses in return, an official has said.  alice visperas, director of the labor ministry's international affairs bureau, said the philippines was open to lifting a cap on health care professionals working overseas if britain and germany sent vaccines in the other direction, reuters reported.  but the offer was rebuffed by the uk, which said it would continue to use shots on its own citizens until a surplus is available.   the philippines limits the number of medical professionals leaving the country to 5,000 a year.  ""we are considering the request to lift the deployment cap, subject to agreement,"" visperas told reuters.  in response, a spokesperson for the uk's department of health told the agency it has ""no plans for the uk to agree a vaccine deal with the philippines linked to further recruitment of nurses. "" britain has purchased many more vaccine doses than it has people, and has said it will distribute surplus doses to poorer countries.   coronavirus cases in the uk are declining after a winter wave of infections, but hospital admissions remain high.  britain has meanwhile overseen a successful vaccine rollout so far, inoculating more than 17 million citizens with at least one dose.  cases are also slowing in germany, but other parts of central europe are seeing infections tick upwards and german authorities have imposed new border checks on nearby countries.  read more on this story here.  ##vaccines## chinese company cansino biologics said on wednesday it has filed an application with china's drug regulator for conditional approval of its covid-19 vaccine.  if approved, the company would become the nation's third vaccine maker to provide shots for conditional public use in china.  cansinobio said that phase 3 clinical trial results show that its coronavirus vaccine has an overall efficacy rate of 65. 28% at preventing all symptomatic cases and 90. 07% at preventing all severe cases 28 days after a single dose.  more than 40,000 volunteers in five countries participated in the trial, the statement added.  sinopharm, the first covid-19 vaccine developer whose doses were approved for conditional public use in china, has an overall efficacy rate of 79. 34%.  sinovac followed, with an overall efficacy rate varying from 50. 4% in trials in brazil to 91. 25% in trials in turkey.  ##vaccines## greece is calling for the european union to adopt covid-19 vaccine ""passports"" in order to open up tourism and allow for summer vacations.   in an interview with the financial times, the minister of tourism, harry theocharis, stressed that the introduction of the vaccination certificate should be a matter of immediate priority for the european union.   ""looking at the reaction of some countries to the proposals of the greek government regarding the vaccination certificate, there is a feeling of short-sightedness,"" he said.  ""and while there is much to be done to prepare for the opening up of tourism and the economy, nevertheless, many countries are focusing too much on the current situation.  but we have to move much faster,"" he said.  theocharis said the eu needs to speed up decision making on protocols for the safe movement of european citizens from country to country.   ""the european union must adopt the vaccination certificate without delay.  people need to know as soon as possible if they will be able to go on a summer vacation this year,"" he urged.  regarding the british government's ban on non-essential international travel, theocharis said: ""i do not understand such warnings, given the progress that is being made in the uk with the vaccination rollout.  i cannot understand why we are now taking steps backwards, even though we now have more and more effective tools in our 'arsenal' compared to last year -- and i mean vaccines and 'rapid tests'. "" currently, a digital certificate is issued to those greek citizens who are vaccinated, but is not mandatory to travel to greece.  ""our goal is simply to relieve those who have acquired immunity from being re-tested for covid-19 upon entering greece,"" he said.   global coronavirus cases fell by 11% in the week leading up to february 21, marking the sixth consecutive week of declining cases, the world health organization said tuesday.   who reported 2. 4 million new cases and 66,000 new deaths that week, a 20% drop in deaths from the week before.  that brings the total to 110. 7 million cases and more than 2. 4 million deaths since the coronavirus pandemic began, according to who figures.  the united states is currently reporting the highest number of new cases, followed by brazil, france, russia and india.  who noted that while many countries are reporting a decline in overall coronavirus cases, reports of covid-19 variants are increasing.  who said the b. 1. 1. 7 variant first detected in the uk has now been found in 101 countries, while the b. 1. 351 variant first detected in south africa has now been found in 51 countries.  the less prevalent b. 1. 1. 28. 1 variant — first identified in brazil and japan — has now been found in 29 countries.  ##variants## ##hotspots## a new, more contagious variant of coronavirus first detected in the uk is likely to fuel a surge of cases in the spring, several experts predicted tuesday.  the variant, called b. 1. 1. 7, was suspected of causing renewed spread in britain.  it's been seen across much of the us -- with the us centers for disease control and prevention estimating the variant makes up for more than 1,880 cases in 45 states.  the variant could ""result in more of a wave"" around april or may, said trevor bedford with the university of washington and the fred hutchinson cancer research center.  so how can the us prevent the suspected spring surge? some experts said tuesday the best way to get ahead of the surge is through vaccinations.   bedford, who has been closely following the rise of new coronavirus variants, predicted that vaccination and mitigation efforts, such as mask use and continued social distancing, will help prevent the virus from spreading further.  ""i still do suspect that things will be brought under control in the summer, and there will be very little virus circulating,"" he said.  it's possible, however, that a new surge could begin in the fall, according to bedford.  the race to vaccinate: more than 44. 5 million people have received at least one dose of their two-dose vaccines, according to data tuesday from the cdc.  about 19. 8 million have been fully vaccinated with both doses, the cdc said -- about 6% of the us population.  one dose of vaccine *might* be enough for some, nih director says:  it's possible a single dose of the pfizer or moderna vaccine might be enough for those who have already been infected with coronavirus -- but it will take more research to show that, national institutes of health director dr.

2020-05-02,'I love you': How a badly-coded computer virus caused billions in damage and exposed vulnerabilities which remain 20 years on,"wearing a striped shirt and matrix-style dark glasses, onel de guzman stared at the floor as he made his way through a crowd of photographers into a hastily arranged press conference in quezon city, a suburb of the philippines capital manila.    skinny, with a mop of black hair falling to his eyebrows, he appeared to barely register the journalists' shouted questions, his only movement the occasional dabbing of sweat from his face with a white towel.  seated to his right, de guzman's lawyer rolando quimbo had to lean in close to hear the 23-year-old's mumbled response, which he then repeated in english for the waiting press.   ""he is not really aware that the acts imputed to him were indeed done by him,"" the lawyer said.  ""so if you ask me whether or not he was aware of the consequences i would say that he is not aware. ""  it was may 11, 2000, and if de guzman was feeling shell-shocked, he had good reason to be.  he was accused of authoring and releasing the first truly global computer virus that had disrupted the operations of businesses and government agencies the world over, from ford and merrill lynch to the pentagon and the british parliament, and was on track to cause a estimated $10 billion in damages — all in the name of love.   twenty years on, the iloveyou virus remains one of the farthest reaching ever.  tens of millions of computers around the world were affected.  the fight to contain the malware and track down its author was front page news globally, waking up a largely complacent public to the dangers posed by malicious cyber actors.  it also exposed vulnerabilities which we are still dealing with to this day, despite two decades of advances in computer security and technology.   this account of the virus is based on interviews with law enforcement and investigators involved in the original case, contemporaneous cnn reporting and reports by the fbi, philippines police and the pentagon.  multiple attempts to reach onel de guzman for this article, including through his family and former lawyer, were unsuccessful.  de guzman had not commented publicly since around 2000, until this week when author geoff white tracked him down to the phone repair shop he now runs in manila, where he admitted to authoring the virus.   lovestruck on the afternoon of may 4, 2000, michael gazeley was in his office at star computer city, a warren of it companies and shops selling electronics and gadgets overlooking hong kong's victoria harbor.  a few months earlier, gazeley and his longtime business partner, mark webb-johnson, founded their own information security firm, network box, which specialized in protecting customers from online threats.  both men had decades of experience in the industry, and had just finished the grueling (though occasionally lucrative) work of preparing for the new millennium by staving off the y2k bug that threatened to cause widespread damage to systems worldwide.   though largely remembered today, much to the chagrin of those involved, as an overreaction — or worse, a hoax — the y2k bug was real, and the potential costs massive.  they were avoided thanks to the diligent efforts of programmers around the world working together.  it was a sign of the new connectivity that the internet, still in its relative infancy, was fostering.   that connectivity cut both ways, however, as gazeley was reminded of that afternoon.   all the phones in his office started ringing at once.  first were his clients, then came non-customers, all calling frantically in the hope that network box could help stop a virus that was screaming through their systems, destroying and corrupting data as it went.   they all told the same story: someone in the office had received an email with the subject ""iloveyou"" and the message, ""kindly check the attached loveletter coming from me. "" when they opened what appeared to be a text file — actually an executable program masquerading as one — the virus quickly took control, sending copies of itself to everyone in their email address book.  those recipients, thinking the email was either some weird joke or a serious declaration of love, opened the attachment in turn, spreading it even further.   office email servers were soon clogged as thousands of love letters went back and forth, disseminating the virus to more people.  it turned out to be much worse than just a self-propelling chain letter.  at the same time as it was replicating itself, the iloveyou virus destroyed much of the victim's hard drive, renaming and deleting thousands of files.   many of the increasingly panicked callers gazeley was fielding inquiries from did not have backups, and he had the awkward job of explaining to them that many of their files — everything from spreadsheets and financial records to photos and mp3s — were likely lost for good.   ""this wasn't something that people were used to as a concept, they didn't realize that email could be so dangerous,"" said gazeley, recounting the first calls.   the entire concept of the internet was still relatively new in 2000.  according to statistics from the international telecommunications union (itu), a united nations body, just 28% of hong kongers had access to the internet at that time, along with 27% of the united  kingdom, and 15% of france.  even in the united states, where the technology was invented, only some 43% of americans were getting online.   two years earlier, hollywood star meg ryan asked ""is it infidelity if you're involved with somebody on email?"" as the movie ""you've got mail"" introduced people to the idea of cyber-romance — and that email could be used for something other than boring office work.   computer chaos from hong kong, where the virus crippled the communications and ravaged file systems of investment banks, public relations firms and the dow jones newswire, the love bug spread westward as the may 4 workday started.   graham cluley was on stage at a security conference in stockholm, sweden, when the virus hit europe.  he had just finished describing an unrelated virus which targeted a now-defunct operating system, hijacking users' accounts to broadcast messages to their coworkers, including ""friday i'm in love. "" this, cluley cracked, was likely to cause severe embarrassment for most people, but could potentially lead to some office romance.  as the conference broke for coffee, attendees' mobile phones and pagers began going off wildly.  several guests approached cluley, asking if the virus he'd described was spread via email.  he assured them it wasn't — and, anyway, it was limited to a niche system that most people didn't use.   ""they said, well, that's weird because we're suddenly getting loads of emails with the subject line 'i love you,'"" cluley said in an interview from his home in the united kingdom.   when cluley turned on his own phone, he was bombarded with notifications of missed calls, voice mails and text messages.  back home, cluley's employer, the anti-virus firm sophos, had been getting ""absolutely hammered"" with phone calls from clients begging for help and journalists trying to understand what the hell was going on.  cluley raced to the airport to catch a flight to london, and even traded phone batteries with a generous taxi driver as the constant stream of messages drained his nokia cellphone of power.  when he landed in the united kingdom, a car was waiting to whisk him to a tv studio to discuss what had by now become one of the biggest tech stories in the world.   in five hours, iloveyou spread across asia, europe and north america, some 15 times faster than the melissa virus did when it struck a year before, infecting over 1 million computers.  soon after starting business on may 4, the united kingdom's house of commons had to take its overloaded email servers offline, as did the ford motor company and even microsoft, whose outlook software was the primary means of spreading the virus.    at the time, windows controlled more than 95% of the personal computer market, and outlook came bundled with microsoft office, then all-but-required for doing business on a computer.  for most people, outlook was email.   unlike today, when many email services are run via centralized servers — think outlook. com or gmail — companies in 2000 were running email off the same servers on which they hosted their website.  this could be janky, slow and startling insecure.   back then, cluley said, ""many companies didn't have in place filters their email gateways to try and stop spam, let alone viruses. "" even though the united states had advance warning, the virus spread just as quickly there — as almost everyone seemed apparently unable to resist opening the ""love letter. "" within the pentagon, there was consternation as the virus hit the united states army forces command (forscom) mailing list, with 50,000 subscribers.   from there, almost every major military base in the country — barring a handful that didn't use outlook — watched as their email services were crippled and forced offline for hours as the problem was fixed.   searching for the culprit across the potomac river, at the fbi's washington, dc, headquarters, michael vatis was scrambling to get a handle on the crisis.   as director of the national infrastructure protection center (nipc), a relatively new intergovernmental agency tasked with tackling cyber threats, vatis was awoken early may 4 with news of the iloveyou virus hitting the united states.  the nipc soon sent out an alert warning of a ""new, in-the-wild worm virus identified as loveletter or lovebug [that] is being propagated globally via e-mail,"" but it came too late to prevent much of the us government and military, as well as dozens of private companies, from being affected.   as anti-virus companies slowly began rolling out patches, stemming the damage and enabling companies to come back online, attention within the fbi turned to tracking down those responsible.  the investigation was led by the new york field office, which soon found evidence pointing back east, beyond hong kong, to the philippines.   ""in a very short period of time, we ended up identifying individuals in the philippines and seeking the assistance of philippine law enforcement,"" said vatis, now a partner at the new york law firm steptoe.  ""and a very short time after that, the philippine authorities ultimately made an arrest. ""  both the technical fix and first break in the case came so fast because, for all its rapid dissemination around the world, the iloveyou virus was clumsily coded and startlingly unsophisticated.  it mashed together several existing pieces of malware and did little to hide its workings.   ""every single victim of the love bug got a copy of the love bug's code, the actual source code,"" said cluley, the sophos analyst.  ""so it was simple to write an antidote.  it was no more complex than any of the other thousands and thousands of viruses we'd seen that day.  but of course, this one was
