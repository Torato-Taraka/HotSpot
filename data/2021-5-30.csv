2021-05-30,"Singapore-based worker known as 'brother yum cha' goes viral in China, Singapore News.","it is 3pm, and the perfect time for a spot of tea.  or in the words of 54-year-old gurdip singh, ""oi, it's time to yum cha!"" yum cha directly translates to drinking tea in cantonese. the singapore-based worker who maintains and repairs ships for a living has become somewhat of a viral sensation in china recently for speaking fluent cantonese. but it's not just his command of the language as a non-chinese in the short 15-second video clip that had people paying attention.  the passion in which he extolls viewers to take a break from work is palpable. armed with a packet of tea, he bellows at the camera: ""have some tea first, what are you working for?""""no use working so hard, your boss won't love you for it.  have some tea first, it's three-something!"" he adds, using a smattering of expletives for emphasis. the video has spawned memes and copycat videos on chinese video-sharing platform bilibili, where the most popular clip has garnered more than three million views within a month. most recently, singh showed off his cantonese-speaking prowess in a video interview conducted with local chinese broadsheet lianhe zaobao.  he explained that he'd picked up the dialect while growing up in kuantan, malaysia, where his neighbours and friends were all chinese. the polyglot is able to speak some mandarin as well.  he is quick to state however, that his command of the language is ""not good"".  ""but my cantonese is excellent, i'm not bluffing you, it's really good,"" joked singh. the ship repairman told zaobao that he had been living in singapore since he was 16, moving here to find work.  he had also spent several years working in russia before returning to singapore. singh expressed surprise at the popularity of the video.  he told zaobao that the clip was recorded in march last year ""pre-covid"", but only went viral earlier this month. it is not clear how the clip found itself onto the video-sharing platform and on social media, but he only realised people were watching when some fans came to see him at his office just last week. ""they brought a packet of tea for me, and told me that i'm famous in china,"" said singh. one reason posited by netizens for the clip's virality in china is how it resonates with a generation of regular employees, especially migrant workers. said one netizen in hong kong: ""it speaks to the hearts of all blue-collared workers. ""with the recent media attention in china on the ""toxic 996 work culture"" as well as other societal pressures, it is evident that the video has struck a chord. wrote one commenter: ""those who don't get the video are not employees who have to do ot (overtime) and work hard.  those who do will feel that this foreign uncle actually cares about us. ""in the words of another netizen: ""i feel unexpectedly touched.  i don't even care for myself as much as this stranger. ""with his newfound fame, singh has received offers of sponsorships and commercial partnerships, and has also been invited to set up a channel on the chinese video platform. but before being known as ""brother yum cha"", singh said he used to have another nickname in singapore — ""elvis"". ""with my sideburns and style, people say i look like elvis presley,"" said singh, who often dresses like the iconic singer in a fitted long-sleeved shirt and leather boots whenever he is out shopping. ""a foreigner at changi airport called out 'elvis' when he saw me and even requested for a selfie,"" said singh proudly. singh added in the interview that he enjoyed his holiday to hong kong with his ex-wife and children back in 2007, where he expectedly amazed locals with his cantonese. ""they were surprised and asked how long i'd been living in hong kong,"" said singh. he hopes to have the opportunity to travel to china again in the future, and hollered for recommendations on where he should visit to ""see pretty things"", adding, ""pretty girls, also can"". candicecai@asiaone.

""the sunday announcement came after the prime minister's office announced on friday that malaysia would beundergoing a ""total lockdown"" from jun 1 to jun 14. malaysia's covid-19 numbers have continued to surge, witha record 9,020 new casesand 98 deaths on saturday.  on sunday, there were6,999 new cases.  there are now more than 560,000 cases nationwide. putrajaya has assured people that there would be sufficient food stocks to last throughout phase 1 of the total lockdown.  however, there have been reports of lines of people flocking to buy necessities and goods in anticipation of tuesday. during the same press conference on sunday, health ministry director-general noor hisham abdullah warned that a daily increase of 1,000 to 2,000 new cases was not impossible, and that the high number of deaths, such as 98 fatalities recorded on saturday, might continue and even rise. ""the health ministry has warned that a situation might arise where doctors might have to make the difficult choice, to give priority for intensive-care unit (icu) beds to patients with higher recovery potential, than those with poor prognosis. ""​​​​​​​​​​​​​​dr noor hisham outlined five actions that the health ministry would take during the two-week lockdown, including allowing breathing space for healthcare personnel and hospitals to reassess their equipment and speeding up the vaccination process. healthcare personnel would also do targeted screenings in the field using the rapid test kit-antigen (rtk-ag) detection method for covid-19, he said. more vaccination centres planned, private clinics to administer jabsearlier on sunday, minister for science, technology and innovation khairy jamaluddin said in a press conference that more vaccination centres will be opened in the coming month to speed up the vaccination process. the first among these will be five mega vaccination centres around the klang valley.  ""three will be in selangor and two will be set up in kuala lumpur,"" he said, adding that the set up would begin on jun 7. mr khairy, who is also the coordinating minister for the covid-19 immunisation taskforce said 1,000 private general practitioner (gp) clinics will be joining the national covid-19 immunisation program by jun 30. he added that 500 of these clinics will begin administering vaccines starting jun 15. ""i estimate that gps and private hospital vaccination centres can contribute and administer 40,000 doses in a day, and 400,000 doses (in total) by jun 30"" he said, adding that this would be subject to the supply of the vaccines. explaining that there were currently 2,500 gp clinics registered under the immunisation program, mr khairy said the government will be paying the private practices to administer the vaccines. besides that mr khairy also shared that malaysia will officially start rolling out drive-through vaccinations for the public after a successful pilot project in a university in kota baru, kelantan . ""we did it in universiti sains malaysia in kubang kerian and it was successful.  we will now allow other states to start this for the public too,"" said the minister. prior to the total lockdown, the government had begun tightening restrictions under a nationwide movement control order, dubbed ""mco 3. 0"" which started on may 12 and will last until jun 7. among the restrictions under mco 3. 0include 80 per cent of public sector employees needing to work from home, and 40 per cent for the private sector.  businesses can only operate from 8am until 8pm daily. downloadour appor subscribe to our telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:https://cna. asia/telegramit looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-05-30,The invisible struggle of people with high-functioning autism — and workplaces that hire them.,"after a lifetime of 'blending in' to survive, employees who hide their autism may not get the help they need to thrive.  but some workplaces are changing that.  this is the first part of a series on adulting with autism. singapore: a stranger might describe khor kuan min as introverted.  after getting to know the 37-year-old better, they might call him polite and articulate, with the occasional touch of self-deprecating humour. those who are observant would notice that he has trouble maintaining eye contact.  but few, if any, might realise he has autism. in his early 20s, he was diagnosed with asperger syndrome, which has been described as a neurodevelopmental condition on the higher-functioning end of the autistic spectrum.  this means individuals like him behave in ways the general population considers as normal. the label ""high-functioning"" is contentious among the autistic community.  some who spoke to cna insider said it is based on a neurotypical person's understanding of ""normalcy"", implying that autistic individuals should display typical developmental and cognitive abilities to fit in. a better replacement for ""high-functioning"", they said, would be ""low support needs"".  but kuan min does not mind the label. ""on the one hand, i know how important the words are.  on the other hand, being too sensitive may make it harder to encourage conversation.  there must be some middle ground,"" he said. ""as long as there's no offence intended and no egregious ignorance involved, to me, it's okay. ""he functions well enough to work in a typical office, namely at moh holdings, the holding company for singapore's healthcare institutions. he has been there for about eight years — doing research and administrative work, among other things — since he completed a master's in english literature at the national university of singapore.  but there are challenges. kuan min struggles with social anxiety due to his autism, especially when it comes to social interaction.  also, a lack of awareness and support during his formative years has had long-lasting effects on his stamina and physical and mental health. although individuals like him would be able to blend in — if they choose — some companies believe that autism is not something to hide and that it can benefit the company.  so they develop hiring programmes to embrace these differences. walking the talkinformation technology consultancy, avanade asia, has been one of these employers since it began a partnership with the autism resource centre (arc) in 2018. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid. as part of a five-step hiring process led by the centre, potential candidates get six to eight weeks of hard-skills training at avanade.  they are assessed on lab work, such as their performance on creating an app. avanade also takes into consideration the candidates' interactions during the training sessions, before deciding how many to hire eventually. with six autistic employees in its singapore branch today, the office has also arranged autism awareness talks to help their colleagues understand them as part of the onboarding process. ""arc provided us with training to let us know what autism spectrum disorder is,"" said tracy chan, avanade's human resources lead for southeast asia. ""what are things we should look out for? what are the differences between neurotypical and neurodiverse adults? why are autistic adults sensitive to noise? why can't they make eye contact?""i've learnt . . .  that when we engage with autistic adults or give them tasks, we have to be very specific . . .  give clear instructions and tell them why they need to do a certain thing, what the purpose of the task is, the output we're looking for and the timeline. ""this is to mitigate the anxiety some employees with autism might face when they do not feel in control of the situation, she added. besides the training sessions — and a job coach from the arc attached to the autistic employee — all avanade employees have a career adviser.  for autistic employees, this adviser must be aware of their condition and how to interact with them. ""when we select a career adviser, we make sure we select the right one for the autistic employees.  we don't simply pick anybody.  the adviser has to go through the autism awareness training too, before we assign them,"" said chan. if it works out, avanade believes employees with autism add value to the team. marvin (not his real name), a back-end developer hired in september, has brought ""stability"" to the team, cited teo chen miin, his supervisor. ""he's a very detail-oriented person, so it's like a trusted pair of hands.  when you give him work, he's very thorough,"" she said. ""there's another autistic employee who'd ask for more work after she's finished her task because she doesn't want to be idling.  they want to show that they can provide value and impact on the work or even on our clients. ""in their shoesthe implications of the label ""high-functioning"", however, are hard to fully shed. ""i appreciate that there's an attempt made to distinguish (on the basis of the autism spectrum),"" said marvin.  ""we're not a monolithic block. ""but (the label) is still an acknowledgement that i'm not truly neurotypical, even though i can be hard to distinguish from someone who's merely introverted or low-key neurotypical.  it causes me a bit of stress because i'm aware there's a gap.  there are times i do wish i was normal. ""the 30-year-old agreed, however, that his inability to grasp the same assumptions, leaps of logic and automatic understanding of certain steps, as a neurotypical peer would, can benefit workplaces — especially if there is support. ""employers should do their best to clarify workflows, like clearly, predictably and specifically spell out explanations, instructions and requirements,"" he cited. ""for example, continuous learning, pursuing certifications, value-adding and proactively performing beyond the requirements of a task are broad and vague ideas.  explain what the expectations are, what it means to be 'exceeding expectations' and how. ""he said employees with autism often have difficulty exceeding expectations because ""being literal-minded, straightforward and even rigid means we work towards objectives and have difficulty understanding the need . . .  to go beyond"". by clarifying assumptions, employers can ensure that everyone is on the same page.  ""you won't have people coming in with different baggage and understandings.  otherwise, they'd wander off in different directions because they subconsciously already have different interpretations,"" he added. over at moh holdings, when kuan min first started his job, he found it ""difficult to socialise and network"".  being around people outside his immediate family, he said, often causes ""a terrible, constricting feeling"" in his chest. his ""inclusive"" team made work easier. ""i told them i was very uncomfortable initiating social contact and that i was more of a 'responder'.  i can respond well enough, but going out there and making something happen is beyond me,"" he said. ""i also mentioned that i wasn't comfortable engaging people personally, like public speaking or facilitation . . .  once that was clear, i assimilated well enough, since they were kind and accommodating. ""he added that his employer tailored his work to his interests, abilities and comfort level as far as possible and listened to any concerns he had. ""my bosses are very supportive . . .  and remain open to expanding my job scope and helping me fulfil my potential whenever i feel ready,"" he said. nonetheless, it frustrates him that he has not yet reached his potential owing to his autism.  ""i'm probably just as ambitious as anyone else, and being unable to fulfil that is distressing,"" he said. ""i accept that i may have to deal with isolation . . .  in my personal life.  but i can't accept that my difference makes it so much harder to earn a good living and realise my potential in a neurotypical-dominated world. ""yet, he does not believe that he simply can choose not to be defined by his autism. ""it's like saying your gender doesn't define you,"" he added.  ""it doesn't define all of you, but it's definitely a fundamental part of your character . . .  i see autism in the same way. ""ultimately, ""the autistic person must be willing and open to asking for and accepting help"" in the workplace. help is availablefor autistic employees such as marvin and kuan min, having a structured programme to support them, as well as their employers and neurotypical colleagues, is crucial. this is where the autism resource centre's five-step process helps autistic individuals to find an ideal job fit.  first, the centre understands the individual's strengths, interests, motivations and past challenges they might have faced. second, individuals are given various scenarios to assess how they would fare in social situations.  third, individuals who make it past step one and two move on to employability training. the first part of this training, conducted by the company they are applying to, involves the hard skills related to the job.  the second part — handled by the centre — focuses on soft skills, like general workplace communication and habits. ""teaching soft skills could be as simple as giving them perspective,"" said arc executive director jacelyn lim. ""one of the traits of autism is being rigid in thinking.  sometimes autistic individuals might not understand what their boss means when he says something, so we teach them what these things would commonly mean in the workplace. ""these soft skills are crucial to helping the individual hold a job, because ""autism is an invisible disability"", added arc senior job coach clarice ng. ""some people on the spectrum may have gone through mainstream education and are academically strong, so employers overlook their challenges and expect them to perform work tasks like any neurotypical (person). ""fourth, after the arc believes the individual is ready to hold a job, they move on to job placement, where they work with employers who have indicated interest in hiring individuals with autism. these companies include starbucks, united overseas bank, moh holdings and avanade asia, with various job scopes spanning data analytics to it back-end development. if individuals are hired, the final step is on-the-job onboarding, including autism awareness talks for their future co-workers and supervisors.  this step usually also involves individuals sharing how autism affects them and how they wish to be supported at work. kuan min and marvin found their employers in this way when they approached the arc's employability and employment centre. as for a company like avanade, employees with autism help it to embrace ""greater neurodiversity"" in the workplace, said chan.  ""if we can create opportunities for fresh grads or (neurotypical people), why can't we do the same for neurodiverse people?""and if companies can . . .  come up with training plans for fresh grads, why can't we come up with training plans for (neurodiverse people)?""it's just about making the effort and time and being patient.

""it is also our firm conviction that if a general assembly resolution on the situation in myanmar is to be helpful to countries in asean, then it needs to be adopted by consensus,"" the letter said. the military's crackdown on protests against its seizure of power has, according to multiple reports, left more than 800 civilian protesters dead a figure disputed by the coup leader, senior general min aung hlaing.  according to him, the figure is about 300, including 47 police officers. many hundreds more, including journalists, have been thrown in jail. fighting with ethnic armed organisations in border areas has also escalated.  fresh waves of people fleeing violence have crossed into thailand and india.  several thousand civilians have reportedly been displaced by fighting in recent days in chin state in north-eastern myanmar, and are living in the jungle. the economy is on the brink of collapse, raising grave concern over a potential humanitarian catastrophe. the international community is in a quandary over myanmar, especially as china and russia back the tatmadaw the military in international forums. in an april 8 article, former australian foreign minister gareth evans said: ""the larger problem with which all of us have to wrestle is that almost any conceivable form of external pressure or intervention, short of unachievable military intervention, seems unlikely to have any really decisive impact. ""a special asean meeting on april 24 came to a five-point agreement with myanmar, including a cessation of violence.  it also proposed a special envoy for myanmar. the regime, however, later said it saw the five points as ""suggestions"" and said the time was not right yet to receive an envoy from asean. there is good reason, however, for the nine asean members to resist the call for an arms embargo, said mr bilahari kausikan, a former senior singapore diplomat. ""first, united nations general assembly resolutions are not legally binding,"" mr kausikan told the straits times.  ""at best, they can be considered recommendations. ""secondly, myanmar's major arms suppliers are china and russia, which will not stop supplying weapons, so in effect the resolution would be futile, he said. ""third, (current asean chair) brunei is trying to get dates from the tatmadaw to visit with the asean secretary-general and needs the tatmadaw's cooperation not just for dates but more generally, for any sort of solution,"" he added.

2021-05-30,"'Very dangerous': Vietnam detects new UK-India ‘hybrid’ Covid-19 variant, Asia News.","authorities in vietnam have detected a new coronavirus variant that is a combination of the indian and uk covid-19 variants and spreads quickly by air, the health minister said on saturday. after successfully containing the virus for most of last year, vietnam is grappling with a rise in infections since late april that accounts for more than half of the total 6,856 registered cases.  so far, there have been 47 deaths. ""vietnam has uncovered a new covid-19 variant combining characteristics of the two existing variants first found in india and the uk,"" health minister nguyen thanh long said, describing it as a hybrid of the two known variants. ""that the new one is an indian variant with mutations that originally belong to the uk variant is very dangerous,"" he told a government meeting, a recording of which was obtained by reuters. [[nid:527488]]the southeast asian country had previously detected seven virus variants: b. 1. 222, b. 1. 619, d614g, b. 1. 1. 7 known as the uk variant, b. 1. 351, a. 23. 1 and b. 1. 617. 2 the ""indian variant"". long said vietnam would soon publish genome data of the newly identified variant, which he said was more transmissible than the previously known types. the world health organization (who) has identified four variants of sars-cov-2 of global concern.  these include variants that emerged first in india, britain, south africa and brazil.  ""at the present time, we have not yet made an assessment of the virus variant reported in vietnam,"" maria van kerkhove, who technical lead for covid-19, said in an emailed statement.  ""our country office is working with the ministry of health in vietnam and we expect more information soon. ""[[nid:521516]]from the who's current understanding, the variant detected in vietnam was the b. 1. 617. 2 variant, more commonly known as the indian variant, possibly with an additional mutation, she said. ""however we will provide more information as soon as we receive it,"" van kerkhove added. long said laboratory cultures of the new variant showed the virus replicated itself very quickly, possibly explaining why so many new cases had appeared in different parts of the country in a short period of time. the health ministry told the meeting the government was working to secure 10 million vaccine doses under the covax cost-sharing scheme, as well as a further 20 million doses of pfizer's (pfe. n) vaccine and 40 million of russia's sputnik v. the country of about 98 million people has so far received 2. 9 million doses and aims to secure 150 million this year.

2021-05-30,Commentary: Worries over COVID-19 situation are taking a mental toll on Singapore.,"urgent attention must be paid to the impact of this raging pandemic on our mental health, former nmp and mental health advocate anthea ong urges. singapore: ""it feels like deja vu,"" a young community worker said, a day after the tightened measures for phase 2 came into effect. he remembers the stress and manic scramble to support children living in rental flats and transitional shelters for home-based learning.  he recalls helping migrant workers with food and essential items during the outbreak in the dormitories at the onset of circuit breaker last year. just 10 days later, two friends with home-based businesses reliant on clients coming to their homes experienced heart palpitations following the announcement of the two-person cap as part ofphase 2 (heightened alert). they are not alone in feeling nervous about the covid-19 situation in singapore.  calls to some mental health hotlines saw a spike on sunday (may 16), the first day of the latest phase of covid-19 restrictions, executives who run these hotlines tell me. covid-19 has taken an emotional toll on uspsychologists have pointed out how stressors released over the uncertainty over livelihoods, routines and catching a deadly virus have created a sense of constant danger and exerted an emotional toll on us. after a year of dealing with a raging pandemic, we have seen signs of increased stress and worry, even when singapore was doing well in curbing infection numbers.  more than nine in 10 singaporeans (91 per cent) have said that their mental health has declined in the last year, according to a study by aia last month. the sources are multifold.  in the #areweokay poll by sg mental health matters conducted between march and april, 51. 2 per cent of respondents said the restrictions on social activities and interactions have negatively impacted their mental health.  forty-four per cent said that changes to work and school had a similar effect. as cases ticked up in recent weeks, fuelling calls for a clean circuit breaker to be pulled, i would argue we should be careful not to do so lightly, not without preparing for the mental health support needed. after all, during the circuit breaker last year, the samaritans of singapore received over 10,000 calls in distress, a 36 per cent increase. over the same period, the non-profit organisation caregivers' alliance supported 11 caregivers, of which six had lost their loved ones to suicide and the remaining five struggling with family members attempting suicide. (mental health groups have seen a surge in calls since covid-19 hit.  who are the people tirelessly manning these helplines? find out on heart of the matter. )it looks like the email address you entered is not valid. many initiatives springing up over past yearpeople focus on the financial costs and risk of deep economic scarring when restrictions slow recovery. just as important but less talked about is the price of loneliness and social withdrawal, domestic violence and unresolved grief, not to mention work-from-home stress and the helplessness over an uncertain, volatile future. there are baby steps to build resilience and support people as this coronavirus persists and should additional restrictions be required.  many government-led and community initiatives have sprung up. a national care hotline was set up in april last year manned by officers trained to provide mental health first aid and refer cases to public healthcare institutions and community service providers to follow up if necessary.  these benefitted 30,000 calls as of october 2020. the ministry of social & family development also recently launched a 24-hour national anti-violence helpline for the public to report cases of family violence, abuse and neglect. it is also heartening to see targeted efforts to aid specific groups, like the seniors go digital programme to help seniors connect online with friends, family and government services. there is also a budding recognition that workplaces must step up where the stressors can come from work.  more employers, like the ceos and leaders i work with at the workwell leaders workgroup, have accelerated plans for employee mental well-being including work-from-home support programmes in the last year. the big challenges for mental healthyet let's be clear about the enormity of the mental health challenges that lie head. while we are better prepared for a second circuit breaker, we carry more baggage picked up from a year of economic uncertainty, pandemic fatigue and the emotional roller-coaster of on-off restriction measures. the mental health divide has also widened, as pandemic measures have a greater impact on segments requiring more attention. blue-collar workers and low-income individuals were the hardest hit by the circuit breaker.  incomes at the 20th percentile fell 4. 5 per cent in june 2020 compared to the same period in 2019, according to the ministry of manpower's labour force report. last year's circuit breaker also shone the spotlight on isolation's ill effects on victims of family violence trapped with abusers, migrant workers confined to dorms and foreign domestic workers with little space away from their employers. would people also know how to find help? less than one in three (29. 7 per cent) of respondents to the #areweokay knew how to seek out subsidised mental healthcare. reframing the conversations over mental healthupdates given by the covid-19 multi-ministry taskforce (mtf) have rightly been focused on the number and breakdown of infections, the ensuing control measures and economic relief support for those affected. yet let's also hope that each mtf incorporates an update on mental health strategies included into our pandemic management approach and provide reminders on the mental health support resources available, as much as reminders to see the doctor if unwell or take a swab test if one has been to an area of infections have become commonplace. ""what gets measured gets done"" is a maxim that should apply to the rate of infections as much as rates of anxiety, depression, self-harm, suicide and other mental health issues from this pandemic, an urgent call also made by psychiatrists and psychologists in the lancet. the government had promised a whole-of-government review of all mental health policies in the budget 2020 parliamentary debates, an inter-agency mental health task force has been set up last october and three new priorities were announced during the budget this year.  yet more needs to be done urgently, including improving accessibility, affordability and quality of mental healthcare. here is also where our national leaders could show compassion to acknowledge the dread and apprehension among those who have been quarantined or received a notification of possible exposure on their tracetogether app. leaders can also demonstrate sensitivity to people's concerns and needs. each day's updates brings a sense of fear reflecting uncertainties around elderly relatives who live away by themselves, employment, healthcare and family care for many even if others may just merely let out another collective sigh and move on. the trauma experienced from covid-19 also gets repeated in varying degrees with every announcement of more clusters and each round of new restrictions. this persistent covid-19 crisis is equally a mental health crisis.  not all of us get infected by the virus but all of us are affected by the mental health impact of the pandemic. anthea ong is a former nominated member of parliament, a professional certified coach, a social entrepreneur (sg mental health matters, a good space, workwell leaders workgroup, hush teabar) and the author of 50 shades of love. where to get help:national care hotline: 1800 202 6868national anti-violence helpline: 1800 777 0000samaritans of singapore hotline: 1800 221 4444institute of mental health's helpline: 6389 2222singapore association of mental health helpline: 1800 283 7019aic hotline (for aged and community care support): 1800 650 6060you can also find a list of international helplineshere.  if someone you know is at immediate risk, call 24-hour emergency medical services.

""there are pros and cons to being big or small.  big clusters have scale and comprehensive capabilities.  small hospitals can be agile and innovative,"" said mr ong, who took over the health portfolio on may 15.  ""we should continue with the structure that we have. "" he added: ""within each cluster, we will have to find ways to make space for skunkworks and make unorthodox ideas become mainstream.  bring out the best of both worlds. "" as part of the last restructuring, three of the existing clusters in 2017 were merged with larger ones, based on location.  this process was completed about a year later.  moh had said in 2017 that the reorganisation would allow public healthcare institutions to deploy their resources and capabilities more efficiently, and also offer employees a wider and deeper range of professional development opportunities.  with the change, each of the three final clusters  has offered a fuller range of services, encompassing acute hospital care, primary care and community care.  each cluster has a medical school.  for instance, nuhs currently runs the national university hospital and six polyclinics in the west, nhg operates tan tock seng hospital and six polyclinics in the central region, while singhealth runs singapore general hospital and eight polyclinics in the east. all three clusters are expected to grow, with nhg set to operate woodlands health campus, which will include an acute hospital and a community hospital, when it opens progressively from 2023. singhealth will run a similar integrated facility in bedok north from around 2030. meanwhile, 12 new polyclinics will be added to the current 20 by 2030.  these include bukit panjang polyclinic, which will open by the end of this year and be run by nuhs. mr ong said that rather than spending time reviewing the current cluster system, the ministry should press on with approaches it first laid out in 2016.  the approaches seek to shift the focus towards general health instead of healthcare, allow patients to receive care in the community and avoid hospital admissions, and increase care quality while ensuring value for money.  these will help to address long-term issues like rising government healthcare expenditure and heavily loaded hospitals.  mr ong said healthcare expenditure is set to hit $59. 1 billion in 2030, up from $20. 7 billion in 2018 and $10. 5 billion in 2010.  the 2030 figure will form about 16 per cent of the government's yearly budget, up from 12 per cent currently. 
the urgent care centre in admiralty sees patients with urgent but non-life-threatening conditions.  photo: woodlands health campus
when system engineer loh xiu hui's right foot swelled up after tripping at home two months ago, she consulted her general practitioner (gp) in sembawang, but he was unable to diagnose the injury without an x-ray. she was referred to the urgent care centre (ucc) beside admiralty mrt station the same day. it is one station from where the gp clinic is located.  she had an x-ray done there and was diagnosed with a fractured toe. her foot was placed in a cast and she was put on crutches.  in total, she paid about $300 in consultation fees and for the medical equipment. ms loh, 24, was one of the approximately 4,000 patients with urgent but non-life-threatening conditions treated at the ucc since its opening last september. the ucc at admiralty, the only one in singapore, is jointly operated by the woodlands health campus and khoo teck puat hospital (ktph). dr lim eng koon, the centre's clinical director, said: ""the majority of our patients' conditions belong to the mild and moderate categories. ""we generally see patients who require urgent medical attention but whose conditions are not life-threatening. ""about 15 per cent of patients were referred to it by gps, with the rest being walk-ins. the centre complements the ministry of health's gpfirst programme, which encourages people with mild to moderate medical conditions to visit their gps first, rather than going directly to the emergency departments in hospitals. launched in changi general hospital in 2014, the gpfirst programme was first introduced in the central region last year through the ucc and ktph. patients referred to the centre by gp clinics participating in the programme receive a $50 waiver off the total fee at the centre. dr lim said the medical centre largely sees minor injuries, suspected fractures, acute respiratory infections, the common cold, stomach flu and abdominal pain which make up about a fifth of all cases there. he said that by treating such patients who require an intermediate level of care, the centre assists emergency departments in preserving resources for those who need them most. ms loh said her waiting and consultation time totalled an hour. ""if i had been sent to the accident and emergency department instead, my condition probably would not have been considered critical, so i could have waited longer,"" she said. the centre charges a basic fee of $90 for singaporeans and $105 for permanent residents and foreigners, with additional charges subject to the services provided. fang yiyangcorrection note: this story has been edited for clarity. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-05-30,"15 years on, mud continues to gush in East Java villages as residents reel from odour and heat.","sidoarjo, east java: indonesian muanisah, who goes by one name, recalled the day when she held her 40-day-old baby in despair as he had trouble breathing. she was just about to have her breakfast on may 29, 2006 when she smelled a pungent odour, which she believed caused her baby to cry while gasping for air. ""he was yawning . . .  unable to breathe.  i was afraid something wrong had happened to my child,"" said mdm muanisah. unaware of what the smell was, she got out of her house but the odour was there too. she decided to take public transport and seek refuge at her family's house a few kilometres away where the air was clean.  there, her baby could finally breathe normally again, she said. ""they (authorities) just said there was a gas leak,"" said mdm muanisah, who was 22-year-old at the time. within a few days, it became clear that the cause of the odour was a mud flow bursting in the middle of a paddy field in sidoarjo, east java, just 200m away from mdm muanisah's house. now, 15 years later, the mud flow has buried thousands of homes, factories and shops.  it is believed to be covering an area of more than 650ha currently and is showing no signs of stopping. the sidoarjo mud flow has disrupted the lives of about 60,000 people, forcing them to flee or adapt to the unpleasant conditions. the mud flow also produces methane, a powerful greenhouse gas that causes global warming and leads to climate change. a february study by senior researcher adriano mazzini et al showed that the mud flow releases 100,000 tonnes of methane yearly into the atmosphere.  this is said to be the site with the highest methane emission ever recorded for a single natural gas manifestation. people suffer from the mud flowthe cause of the mud flow is still a topic of debate until today. some argue that the eruption was triggered by a 6. 3 magnitude quake two days earlier in yogyakarta, some 260km away. there are also people who believe that drilling by oil and gas company lapindo brantas nearby was the culprit.  others think that the combination of both events may have contributed to the mud flow. mr khudori, whose house was buried by the mud flow six months after it first emerged, is frustrated by the inconveniences. ""the smell was too strong . . .  and it also affected the water, (i got) itchy, it was polluted, we can't drink it.  previously, we could drink it before mud flow existed. ""after the emergence of the mud flow, sometimes if i take a shower, i'll feel itchy.  and the smell made me short of breath,"" said mr khudori, who goes by one name. the 54-year-old was forced to find a new home about 1. 5km away. ""i can still smell it.  never mind 1. 5km, even at the distance of 5km it can still be smelled during the rainy season. ""if it's the rainy season, the smell of methane is very strong.  though when it is the dry season, it is not so obvious,"" said mr khudori. he also observed that since the mud flow emerged, sidoarjo has become hotter.  ""the mud flow releases heat,"" the father of six said, adding that floods seemed to occur more now. he said there is nothing he can do about the condition, apart from turning to bottled mineral water for consumption. a 2017 study showed that the mud temperature, which was previously 100 degree celsius, was 60 degree celsius.  meteorological agency data showed that the average temperature in sidoarjo has seen an increase of less than 1 degrees celsius in the last 15 years. mr khudori, who used to work at a factory near the mud flow, now works as a motorcycle taxi rider with no fixed income as the mud had also buried his workplace. mdm muanisah, whose house was buried by the mud in november 2006, has since rented a house about 5km away from the mud flow. she said there is also nothing she can do about the complaints they have, apart from using a mask at home to repel the odour she occasionally smells. ""even before covid-19, i have gotten used to wearing a mask,"" she said. embankment and pipes to contain the burstat its peak, the mud discharged was equivalent to about 25 olympic-sized swimming pools daily, said authorities. to ensure that the mud flow does not continue to bury the surroundings, an embankment and pipes have been built to divert the mud to a nearby river. the mud comprises 80 per cent water, said mr pattiasina jefry recky, head of sidoarjo mud control center (ppls) which is the agency overseeing the mud flow. ""the mud from the burst is about 60,000 to 90,000 cubic metres per day.  and we can flow about 30 million cubic metres per year into the porong river, but that is not enough because we are dealing with quite a lot of problems. ""the ships which (pump the mud) are old ships, so we can't work more effectively,"" he said. in addition, the agency needs to ensure that the embankment is strong. mr pattiasina said some geological experts predicted that the mud flow will ooze for at least 40 years. ""it has only been 15 years.  if the drainage and embankment protection is safe, then it is safe. ""we're only afraid of the rainy season because our embankment is an earthen-filled dam.  it was built in a rush back then.  for us technical people, a technical embankment should not be like that. ""he said that the embankment is 11m high.  ""and most likely it can't be more than that.  we are afraid that if it is higher, it will collapse because the carrying capacity is not strong,"" he added. proposals to make use of the mud flowmr mazzini, who is a senior researcher at the centre of earth evolution and dynamics (ceed) of the university of oslo, said the sidoarjo mud flow is something between a magmatic volcano and a mud volcano. mr mazzini, who has studied the mud flow since 2006 and has visited the site numerous times, concluded that the mud flow is connected to the active arjuno-welirang volcanoes about 20km away. the conclusion was made because the gas and water from the mud flow and the volcanoes are the same. his latest study, which was conducted with his colleagues using a combined method of ground-based and satellite observations, showed that the methane concentration in sidoarjo is very high compared to other parts of east java.  most of the methane originates from the mud flow, according to the study. government agencies told cna they do not know how much gas methane has been released by the mud flow. mr pattiasina of ppls said there have been plans to make lithium batteries out of the mud, but as of now it is still being discussed. head of sidoarjo's environment and sanitation agency sigit setyawan said the agency had planned to work with an energy company to produce biomass from the mud as an alternative source of renewable energy since 2019. ""however, the plan was constrained by the covid-19 pandemic,"" he told cna. he added that the agency also proposed to plant productive crops on the land buried by the mud, which the government has bought from locals as the area was too dangerous to live in. government has to do more: environment ngomr anung suprayitno, head of the meteorological, climatological and geophysical agency (bmkg) malang, said that even though the mud flow has existed for 15 years, more data is needed to conclude its impact on the climate. the agency, which oversees the management of meteorological and climatological data throughout east java, said it does not know the full extent of sidoarjo mud flow's contribution to greenhouse gas emission. while meteorological data in the last 15 years shows that the temperature at sidoarjo has increased by less than 1 degree celsius and rainfall has increased in a small amount, mr suprayitno said the agency does not know if the mud flow is an reinforcing factor that accelerates the local scale of climate change. mr rere christanto, who is the director executive of environmental non-governmental organisation walhi east java, said that there has been an increase in disasters over the past few years in east java especially floods and landslides. the sidoarjo mud flow is part of a site that accounts for the largest emission of methane gas, and hence it has a big role to play in the build-up of greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere, he said. he said it is important that the government acknowledges this and does more than discharging the water sludge into the porong river. the government has to analyse the mud and look into the possible extent and danger of its content, he said. ""now, if we have a threat map, we can imagine what actions the government can take and then take precautions.  how large the area is and where.  for example, the community can be given masks to wear. ""but it won't happen if the government doesn't want to admit (that the site releases huge amounts of methane). ""it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-05-30,"Heartbreaking: Remains of 215 children found at former indigenous school site in Canada, World News.","the remains of 215 children, some as young as three years old, were found at the site of a former residential school for indigenous children, a discovery canadian prime minister justin trudeau described as heartbreaking on friday. the children were students at the kamloops indian residential school in british columbia that closed in 1978, according to the tk'emlúps te secwépemc nation, which said the remains were found with the help of a ground penetrating radar specialist. ""we had a knowing in our community that we were able to verify,"" tk'emlúps te secwépemc chief rosanne casimir said in a statement.  ""at this time, we have more questions than answers. ""canada's residential school system, which forcibly separated indigenous children from their families, constituted ""cultural genocide,"" a six-year investigation into the now-defunct system found in 2015. the report documented horrific physical abuse, rape, malnutrition and other atrocities suffered by many of the 150,000 children who attended the schools, typically run by christian churches on behalf of ottawa from the 1840s to the 1990s. it found more than 4,100 children died while attending residential school.  the deaths of the 215 children buried in the grounds of what was once canada's largest residential school are believed to not have been included in that figure and appear to have been undocumented until the discovery. trudeau wrote in a tweet that the news ""breaks my heart it is a painful reminder of that dark and shameful chapter of our country's history. ""in 2008, the canadian government formally apologized for the system. the tk'emlúps te secwépemc nation said it was engaging with the coroner and reaching out to the home communities whose children attended the school.  they expect to have preliminary findings by mid-june. in a statement, british columbia assembly of first nations regional chief terry teegee called finding such grave sites ""urgent work"" that ""refreshes the grief and loss for all first nations in british columbia.

2021-05-30,"Shift in emphasis from hospital to community care will help tame healthcare costs: Ong Ye Kung, Health News & Top Stories.","read 3 articles daily and stand to win st rewards, including the st news tablet worth $398. spin the wheel for st read and win now. singapore the exponential rise in national healthcare spending cannot be allowed to cripple singapore's future, said health minister ong ye kung as he laid out the steps being taken to rein in costs without compromising the quality of care. key to this is moving healthcare upstream by letting general practitioners (gps), polyclinics and community hospitals play larger roles, allowing ""heavily loaded"" hospitals to focus on patients who need specialist care or emergency cases. ""our current national healthcare expenditure has almost doubled from $10 billion in 2010 to $21 billion in 2018.  it will almost triple to $59 billion in 2030.  this exponential rise is worrying,"" mr ong told more than 700 healthcare workers during his ministry's annual work plan seminar, which was delivered virtually on tuesday (may 25).  an ageing population, coupled with a ""buffet syndrome"" of choosing multiple treatments regardless of effectiveness, with insurers picking up the tab, will force the government to increase subsidies ""that we will find increasingly hard to afford"", he said. mr ong reiterated a three-pronged strategy, first mentioned at the debate on the health ministry's budget in 2016, to avoid this.  the first part of the strategy is to move ""beyond quality to value"".  this includes using drugs and treatments that are the most cost-effective.  there will be negotiations with suppliers to ensure that prices charged match the outcomes they deliver, he said. another important element is to ensure ""we do not inadvertently erode the spirit of co-payment"".  ""once there is some skin in the game, consumers will exercise prudence in healthcare spending and doctors will exercise more discretion in recommending the appropriate treatments,"" mr ong explained. the second part of the strategy is to go ""beyond hospital to community"". calling for expanded roles for gps, polyclinics and other primary healthcare providers in the community, mr ong said ""the centre of gravity must shift away from the acute care hospital towards the community, with focus on appropriate care in the right setting. ""patients will benefit from less hassle, greater accessibility to care, and at lower cost. ""mr ong said that private gps can become an integral part of ""the continuum for healthcare"" alongside polyclinics, which are already regarded as community institutions. ""a gp's care for his patient goes beyond the four walls of his private clinic,"" he said. ""he can be the village doctor (who) understands the patient and his family, helps them manage chronic diseases; the confidant (whom) stubborn family members listen to; and often the link to the wider healthcare network. ""mr ong said that pharmacists, too, can play an important role, such as in educating patients on the proper use of medication, to reduce hospital re-admissions. nurses trained in diagnosing and managing common medical conditions can also order tests and prescribe medicine, saving patients time and cost. mr ong also said that patients in rehabilitation should ""step up"" and not ""step down"" to community hospitals and long-term care facilities. he said that multidisciplinary teams can provide ""the right care at the right site"" for medically stable patients in those facilities. community hospitals in outram and sengkang were opened in 2019 and 2018 respectively, while integrated facilities comprising both acute and community hospitals are in the pipeline for woodlands and bedok north. meanwhile, 12 polyclinics will be added to the existing 20 by 2030.  three of them – in eunos, kallang and bukit panjang – will open by the end of this year. mr ong also said the ""beyond healthcare to health"" approach – the third part of the strategy – will continue to be pursued, with intervention going upstream to encourage healthier lifestyles. ""whether it is war on sugar, battle with salt, alliance with exercise – the health promotion board and our clusters must integrate their efforts and do what it takes to reshape lifestyles.

2021-05-30,"Residents urged to do their part as estates struggle with fewer cleaners and more garbage, Singapore News & Top Stories.","read 3 articles daily and stand to win st rewards, including the st news tablet worth $398. spin the wheel for st read and win now. singapore about 60 per cent of the migrant workers of tampines north's new cleaning contractor have been unable to enter singapore to start work. the 40 per cent of workers who are here have had to work extra hard, amid more waste being generated as people spend most of their time at home during the covid-19 phase two (heightened alert) period, said tampines grc mp baey yam keng in a facebook post on friday (may 28). several mps told the straits times they face similar manpower shortages in their constituencies, urging residents to do their part to keep the estates clean. some migrant workers have returned home and replacements are difficult to get due to tighter border controls here.  mr baey told st on saturday: ""i know most residents are law-abiding and considerate, but for the few black sheep in the community, i hope they can be reminded to do their part and keep the estate clean. "" he said the new contractor took over on april 1, adding that the workers here are doing their best to keep the neighbourhood's common areas clean, even as they have to dispose of more garbage – such as food and online delivery packages – than before.  there are also more instances of trash being disposed of inappropriately, he said.  in one case, a resident living on the third storey of a block had complained that his rubbish chute was overflowing.  when the town council investigated, it found that someone had thrown laundry poles down the chute, clogging it.  rubbish piled up as a result. mr lim biow chuan, the mp for mountbatten and chairman of marine parade town council, said manpower has been stretched during this period, amid the increase in garbage volume. he also highlighted the issues that could arise from indiscriminate littering.  litter such as food waste could attract vermin, while food containers could be receptacles for water and turn into mosquito breeding grounds, he said. rubbish piled up in corridors can also pose a fire hazard, mr lim added. while there has not been an increase in dengue cases in his constituency, ""you just need one instance and you can get a lot of mosquitoes from one site"", he added. according to the national environment agency (nea) website, there were three red dengue clusters – areas with 10 or more cases of dengue – as at friday.  these are in rosewood drive, tuas south boulevard and cashew terrace. mr liang eng hwa, the mp for bukit panjang, said the issues of manpower shortage are faced not just by cleaning contractors, but also contractors doing maintenance and repair work, and horticulture. he said some hot spots for litter have been identified, and the nea has started to conduct surveillance and enforcement.

""we are also looking at our own ways to do surveillance, such as with mobile (closed-circuit television cameras), to monitor the hot spots,"" he added. mr lim said his town council is working with the nea to step up enforcement against high-rise littering.  ""but you can do only so much with enforcement.  we hope our residents do their part too and not take the cleaners for granted, or we will never have a clean estate,"" he said. ""we hope to send the message that clearing rubbish is something everyone has a responsibility to do. ""mr kane tan, a resident in nee soon east, said his estate is quite clean, although he does notice littering and some bulky rubbish in common areas at times. the 45-year-old project manager said the clearing of rubbish is everyone's responsibility and that there could be more effort to educate people not to litter.  mr nicholas makoto, 28, who lives in shunfu, is concerned about items such as food packets and drink cans that are left around, as well as litter thrown out of windows. the freelance animator said: ""for the workers who have to pick up these stray pieces of trash – that just hinders them from doing their job smoothly, on top of the added work they are given.

2021-05-30,"Nightlife, karaoke businesses still see a future despite the ongoing COVID-19 challenges.","singapore: their businesses may have been hit hard, their dance floors converted to pop-up restaurants and their karaoke rooms turned into work spaces, but operators of nightlife and entertainment businesses say that there remains hope for the industry amid the covid-19 pandemic. speaking to cna, chief executive officer of zouk group andrew li noted that the demand for the industry remains. ""we're a species that needs that social kind of element . . .  for example, when you saw dining coming out, dining was flying because people just wanted to go out and eat.  they wanted to have fun with their friends,"" he said. ""and i think bars and nightlife are another level of that, where it is even more sociable and i think that's very, very important to us as a society. ""havefun karaoke founder mr flint lu echoed such sentiments, pointing out that socialising is an ""essential need"". ""we are still confident about (the) post-covid market.  so we have no other way but to stick to the plan of how to survive this pandemic,"" explained mr lu. ms jean teo, who is a director at teo heng karaoke, said that karaoke singing is part of the ""lifestyle"" in singapore. ""we find that there are a lot of people who really love singing,"" she told cna.  ""it has become a way for us to express ourselves.  and it's also very good for our mental health, it helps us to really relieve our emotions and de-stress and all that.  i get a lot of feedback from people, that once we are open, they will definitely come and support (us). ""singapore nightlife business association (snba) president joseph ong noted that many in the industry would like to return. ""they need the nightlife to be vibrant, in order for them to do well . . .  so we definitely have to bring that part of the business back.  but in a safe manner, in a careful manner,"" he told cna. alcohol suppliers had also told him that sales in supermarkets are ""higher than ever before"", mr li noted. ""people are definitely still drinking, they're just not drinking in restaurants and bars they are drinking at home.  so that for me is the indication that people still need that,"" he said. ""but definitely, i think here in singapore, people want to (re-)enter the space in a safe way. ""but first, business owners will need to grit their teeth through the pain, with the latest challenge being singapore's phase 2 (heightened alert). as part of the move, a series of measures have been put into place in order to tackle a spike in covid-19 community cases.  one of these measures has been the prohibiting of dining-in, which is currently forbidden from may 16 through jun 13. mr li noted that the latest measures have been an additional challenge to zouk, which had already changed its business in a number of ways. pointing to how it had transformed its capital lounge space into pop-up restaurant capital kitchen, mr li said that its atmosphere had been a big draw for customers. with dining in not allowed, there is less of an incentive for customers to order food to go, he pointed out. ""people were sitting down and they were enjoying themselves and you could hear the sound and stuff, so it was the closest they could get to what capital was in the past,"" he said. ""when you take all that away that social part and then also the music and vibe and stuff and you're just saying okay we're going to deliver you fish and chips . . . .  that is something that's been very, very tough for us. ""mr ong noted that the current state of play means that some bars and pubs have moved into an ""almost shut down"" position. in the 'triple target zone'but even before the newest measures, industry players had already faced a number of struggles, said mr ong, who is also founder and managing director of 1-group, which owns a number of clubs and bars. karaoke joints, along with pubs and bars without food licences, nightclubs and discotheques, have been shuttered since march 2020 as part of singapore's measures to stem the covid-19 pandemic. even as singapore gradually reopened its economy and allowed most activities to resume, nightlife venues have remained closed due to the higher risk of coronavirus transmission. in october last year, education minister lawrence wong, who is the co-chair of the multi-ministry task force on covid-19, noted that the nightlife industry had to be prepared for ""quite a long period of restrictions"". ""we know these are higher-risk settings.  the nature of the activities themselves, of such activities, means that you have people socialising in close contact, often in a small enclosed space and risk is very much higher,"" said mr wong at a multi-ministry task force press conference. ""the pandemic frustrates everyone, not just us,"" said mr ong.  ""again the problem really for our industry is that we are in that 'triple target zone'.  we are a vibrant place, we are masked down, we basically encourage socialising and all that . . .  so it is a triple whammy in terms of this is the kind of situation that the authorities want to avoid. ""and while some have managed to pivot and reopen as food and beverage outlets, not all have been able to do so successfully. one of snba's goals has been to help businesses pivot as well as exit the market, noted mr ong. it had been announced previously that nightlife establishments that wished to pivot to other permissible activities could apply for a grant of up to s$50,000 from enterprise singapore (esg) to defray qualifying costs incurred during the pivoting process, such as equipment and third-party consultancy costs. nightlife establishments exiting the industry can apply to esg for an ""ex-gratia"" payment of s$30,000 to defray the costs of the cessation of business. both of these support schemes are effective until the end of september. should they be the recipient of either one of the financial support packages, the business will not be allowed to participate in the pilot programme or any subsequent resumption of nightlife operations for at least 12 months, the ministry of home affairs had announced previously. snba has seen over 400 businesses deciding to pivot, while over 300 have exited the market, said mr ong. ""right now, none of us can operate the bars and clubs the way we were doing so . . .  some of them still hold on to the fact that they possibly can re-open.  (but) for many of them, they have already terminated their employees, they have already sent back their entertainers, they are in a very dormant mode,"" he added. 'losing less is earning'pivoting to an f&b business model has been a struggle, said mr lu, pointing out that the lack of mechanical and electrical provisions on premises means that it is a struggle to install a full kitchen set-up. ""the layout, the furniture we use sofas and tea tables, which is not suitable for f&b.  it is not a good setup for lunch or for dinner,"" he added. ""as a newcomer, with no professional chef team, no full kitchen and (a) limited variety of food and poor set up for dinner, lunch . . .  it's very difficult to catch enough customers. ""and despite havefun karaoke pivoting to a f&b model, the revenue generated was not enough to cover operating expenses, and the company's revenue dropped 90 per cent from pre-covid times, said mr lu. this will be further exacerbated with the current situation, he noted. ""as no dine-in (is) allowed under the new restrictions, we can only operate (a) few outlets with take-away services.   revenue will drop dramatically and cash flow will be even more (of a) challenge,"" he added. teo heng has closed four out of its 14 outlets, said ms teo, but has decided not to pivot to an f&b business model.  instead, it set up co-working spaces and study spaces in some of its karaoke rooms, beginning last month. ""there are quite a lot of supporters who come in, but, of course, it won't be the same . . .  as what we did previously,"" she said. ""this is more or less to help us to bridge over this difficult period . . .  by losing less it is already an earning for us. ""amid the continued pandemic, mr ong stressed the need for trials to test the feasibility of businesses operating. ""moving forward, sandboxes will probably be something that we have to push very hard (for), and i'm hoping that they will start doing that right after we manage the situation on the ground,"" he said. ""i believe singapore needs to adopt this attitude, where we should always be trialing or sandboxing certain entertainment, nightlife activities and all that. ""under a small-scale pilot for the nightlife sector, it was announced in december that three bars and pubs would be allowed to reopen for two months.  this pilot was later extended till apr 7. however, another pilot for nightclubs and karaoke outlets to reopen with covid-19 safety measures in place was deferred until further notice in january.  it was slated to start in the same month. mr li pointed out that while it was important for nightlight businesses to come back in a safe way, the overall consumer experience would also need to be considered. one of the criteria set by the pilot was that customers entering karaoke lounges and nightclubs would need to test negative for covid-19 24 hours before the end of the activity at the nightlife establishment.  alcohol also cannot be sold, served or consumed after 10. 30pm. ""the guests won't come if you tell them you have to have a pcr (polymerase chain reaction) test.  they're not going to want to do it i'll just go to a bar, i'll go to a restaurant, why would i have to go to a club?"" asked mr li. ""it has to be enjoyable as well, because if you're sitting in a group of five, and you can't listen to music, and you're going home at 1030 (pm), (you) might as well go to restaurants and do that instead.  so how we come back into that space, i think it's definitely going to need to be a discussion between us the nightlife industry and the authorities. ""mr lu pointed out that the reopening of licensed entertainment premises with ""reasonable"" restrictions could help tackle the issue of illegal set ups which he said currently operate in the face of restrictions. ""the previous customer base, they do have options for singing and partying.  even during this covid period, the legal ones are not allowed to open so there are a lot of illegal ones that are outside,"" said mr lu. despite the doom and gloom, mr ong believes the pandemic presents a ""watershed"" moment for the industry. ""(now) we can really fully define it and because the slate now is almost clean, we can really redraw what we want and snba has a vision we want singapore to be the go to lifestyle destination,"" he said. ""the funny thing about the nightlife businesses is really that you have (the) majority of the operators in the nightlife business being people who view a glass half full rather than half empty.  so i believe that . . .  the nightlife (industry) will come back.

2021-05-30,IN FOCUS: Is there an environmental cost from Singapore’s love affair with en bloc sales?.,"while en bloc sales have their merits, the process of knocking down a building only to construct another comes with an environmental cost.  cna explores how collective sales can be done in a more sustainable way. singapore: in 2002, olivio, a 36-unit condominium in novena was completed and welcomed its new residents.  but just four years later, it was sold en bloc and torn down. to this day, it remains one of the youngest condominiums to have undergone a successful collective sale – which is when owners band together to sell their project to a developer. since the 1990s, a few en bloc cycles have come and gone, with the most recent lasting from 2017 to 2018, before cooling measures put the brakes on. analysts expected the trend tobud again this year, as developers seek to replenish their land banks, amid a property market that has defied the economic gloom of the pandemic. four collective sales have taken place since january, compared to four in the whole of 2020, while more projects have been taking another stab at a collective sale. the phenomenon owes its longevity to several practical reasons, such as allowing urban renewal and, often, a handsome windfall for those selling their units. but some believe singapore's love affair with en bloc sales is becoming increasingly problematic, in light of its recent pledges to sustainability. in particular, the country has crafted agreen building masterplanto reduce the carbon footprint of the built environment sector, which accounts for 20 per cent of the country's emissions. the issue is that the process of tearing down and re-building is highly carbon-intensive, and especially wasteful when developments in good condition are demolished, said experts cna spoke to. ""it's not the building's fault it has to die""buildings in singapore have shorter average lifespans than in other cities, said professor thomas schroepfer, who teaches architecture and sustainable design at the singapore university of technology and design. ""when buildings are torn down, it's not necessarily because one cannot live there, but often it's economic drivers. ""it's not the building's fault it has to die . . .  particularly, because of a lack of development land, the pressure is really high to build bigger, denser, modern buildings,"" he said. theoretically, structures can last a long time, with the world's largest unreinforced concrete dome, the pantheon in rome, still in ""brilliant condition"" after some 1,900 years, said ms alexis chua, course chair of the school of design & environment at ngee ann polytechnic. signs of wear and tear can start showing as early as within five years, but singapore's building guidelines also generally ensure developments can last many decades, she noted. dr lee nai jia, deputy director of the institute of real estate studies at the national university of singapore added that buildings are usually built to last for the tenure of the land. he added: ""while it makes sense to redevelop if the buildings become structurally unsafe, there were a number of developments sold en bloc that were less than 20 years old. ""data he compiled shows that since 1995, at least 51 developments that have been sold en bloc were less than 20 years old. he added that there are no specific laws dictating the age at which buildings can be demolished. environmental price of constructioncycling through buildings before their time is up creates environmental problems, said prof schroepfer. ""you have to take care of the debris from tearing down, there's steel, concrete, glass all materials that have high (embodied carbon), meaning it was very energy-intensive to bring them into life in the first place. some of these are then recycled, but ""it's not like other industries where the recycling rate is much higher"", he said. producing new materials, transporting them and starting construction kicks off the cycle all over again. ""so in terms of life cycle analysis, the tearing down and rebuilding is very energy hungry, and therefore not good for environment,"" he said. for context, about 40 per cent of global carbon emissions are already from building and construction, according to the world green building council.  operational emissions form 28 per cent of this, while embodied carbon emissions account for 11 per cent. in singapore, where the lifespan of buildings is shorter due to urban renewal, embodied carbon emissions could go up to 40 per cent, the council's chair, lisa bates, toldeco-business. why do en blocs sales exist at all?the main goal of the collective sales framework is to give owners a choice on whether to go for redevelopment – which could allow for rejuvenation and land use optimisation, the national development ministry told cna. for instance: ""pipes start to leak, or you get analogue lifts and you can't get spare parts for these anymore, because people have moved on to digital lifts,"" said ms ong choon fah, the chairperson of the urban land institute. ""even technicians may not know how to service these lifts anymore, so you need to keep these buildings maintainable. ""in addition, when master plans raised plot ratios for certain areas in the past, en bloc redevelopment made sense, as they allowed developers to intensify land use. ""now we are talking about20-minute towns, and with covid-19 . . .  the role of offices have changed.  these collective sales and urban renewal helps us move on with planning intents,"" said ms ong, who is also the ceo of edmund tie & company. on top of that, as singapore's ageing population grows while household sizes dwindle, older developments with larger units may not be ""as relevant"", said mr wong xian yang, who heads research at cushman & wakefield singapore. in fact, collective sales can even contribute to sustainability by refreshing outdated infrastructure with eco-friendly features, said mr wong. this includes incorporating more energy-efficient ventilation systems, air-conditioning systems, household appliances, and introducing more greenery in the development. to boot, it is often a way for older residents to cash out on their property as they prepare for retirement, ms ong said. en bloc sales are also a way for developers to get freehold property.  the only other way to acquire land is through the government land sales programme, but these are leasehold plots. cultural loss and social displacementthough the collective sale process has its merits, critics have also cited disadvantages beyond the environmental damage. prof schroepfer said: ""remodeling of the city over and over would come at cultural cost.  even within a lifetime, the city – you can't recognise it anymore.  the places you grew up with are no longer there. ""ms ong cited how certain iconic post-independence buildings such as pearl bank apartments have been cleared as part of the en bloc process. such sales also often lead to the displacement of communities – especially for older residents who may want to age-in-place. as for the argument about making better use of land, mr nicholas mak, who heads research and consultancy at era realty, said that plot ratios for most areas have not increased in many years. ""(many of these buildings) are built to the maximum allowable plot ratio already. ""this means that for (more recent) en bloc sales, it is not because there is plot ratio to be increased, but because there is money to be made. ""changing en bloc laws?bearing these factors in mind, is there a need to change existing en bloc sale laws?in the past, 100 per cent consensus from owners was needed to put a project on the market. currently, under the land titles (strata) act (ltsa), buildings less than 10 years old must obtain 90 per cent consent from owners before allowing the collective sale to go through. those 10 years old and above require 80 per cent consent. ruling out en bloc sales entirely for the sake of the environment or other factors would be too extreme, said experts. instead, a more feasible change would be to tighten age requirements, said mr mak. ""say, instead of below 10 years, make it 20 or 30 years, such that any building less than 30 years old will need a higher percentage of consensus. ""another possibility would be to raise the level of consensus needed to 85 per cent and 95 per cent for older and younger buildings respectively, he said. but other than that, there is little that can be done to discourage sellers from going en bloc, as the returns can be high, said dr lee. indeed, a collective sale can give owners a premium of at least 40 per cent, compared to if they were to sell individually on the open market, said ms ong. alternatively, given that the need for land is a driving factor behind en blocs, gls programmes could be ramped up to give developers more supply. but this is may not be feasible in the long-run because there is a finite amount of state-owned land – and this varies from district to district, experts said.  for instance, supply is tight in the central business district. rejuvenating without demolishinginstead, the best option may be to repurpose buildings that go en bloc, instead of demolishing them entirely, said experts. ""urban rejuvenation is possible without demolition"", said prof schroepfer, pointing to examples such as the fullerton hotel, which used to be a post office. ms ong also noted how the partially-conserved former national aerated water company has been integrated with a new residential development, jui residences. leasehold apartment development tan quee lan suites is also housed within a refurbished old building. government buildings that have been repurposed include the old hill street police station, which is now the office of the ministry of communications and information, and the old parliament house, which is now the arts house. the concept of addition and alteration is also common in other territories, such as hong kong. over in the united kingdom, a campaign – backed by 14 winners of the stirling prize, the most prestigious architectural award in the country – has also urged authorities to provide incentives for owners to upgrade buildings, instead of knocking them down. but in the first place, buildings must be designed with ""long-term thinking"" to best facilitate the possibility of future conversions – and this requires an industry-wide change in mindsets, said ngee ann polytechnic's ms chua. greening the building's life cyclethere are several steps that can be taken at each stage of a building's life to make it greener. firstly, good workmanship and quality materials are the foundation in slowing future wear and tear, said ms chua. energy-efficient systems should be factored in at the design stage.  the green mark framework, which measures a building's energy performance and impact, already requires baseline standards to be met by all new developments. during the building process, more sustainable materials, such as timber, should be more widely promoted, said prof schroepfer. to get more developers onboard with sustainable building, authorities could dangle the carrot of additional gross floor area as an incentive, dr lee added. once the building is running, regular maintenance is important, said ms chua.  this can be taken a step further with pre-emptive maintenance via data analytics, which would prolong the building's lifespan. when a building is torn down, demolition protocols have been put in place pushing the recovery of higher quality recycled materials. but ms chua noted that ""the rationale of current protocols in place could be re-examined"".  for example, she said warehouses' traditional metal doors and gates are often dismantled as waste metal, instead of being given a new lease of life in another new building. dr lee added that recycling waste should be further incentivized, while ms chua said more r&d efforts can be put into finding new ways to upcycle it. all these moves may result in higher costs of development, warned dr lee.  this comes at a time when the construction industry is already suffering from an acute manpower crunch and rising prices. these sustainable technologies will be expensive at the start, which is why the government plays an important role in supporting firms and start-ups exploring these aspects, he said. ""(this would help them) achieve scale and lower the costs quickly over time"", he said. striking a balancethe stronger sense of environmentalism that has emerged within society has seen the industry pay attention, experts added. developers such as lendlease, cdl and frasers property have pledged to reach net zero carbon targets.   several local architectural and engineering firms have become founding signatories of a global petition, construction declares, committing to ""take positive action"" in response to the climate crisis. amid an industry-wide push for more sustainability, green buildings are on track to becoming the default. with these developments in mind, ms ong says a holistic approach is needed when squaring the merits of en bloc sales with their potential environmental impacts. ""it's not binary and it should not be a zero-sum game, but rather, a delicate balance is needed,"" she said. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

merits, the process of knocking down a building only to construct another comes with an environmental cost.', 'cna explores how collective sales can be done in a more sustainable way.', 'singapore: in 2002, olivio, a 36-unit condominium in novena was completed and welcomed its new residents.', 'but just four years later, it was sold en bloc and torn down.', 'to this day, it remains one of the youngest condominiums to have undergone a successful collective sale – which is when owners band together to sell their project to a developer.', 'since the 1990s, a few en bloc cycles have come and gone, with the most recent lasting from 2017 to 2018, before cooling measures put the brakes on.', 'analysts expected the trend tobud again this year, as developers seek to replenish their land banks, amid a property market that has defied the economic gloom of the pandemic.', 'four collective sales have taken place since january, compared to four in the whole of 2020, while more projects have been taking another stab at a collective sale.', 'the phenomenon owes its longevity to several practical reasons, such as allowing urban renewal and, often, a handsome windfall for those selling their units.', ""but some believe singapore's love affair with en bloc sales is becoming increasingly problematic, in light of its recent pledges to sustainability."", ""in particular, the country has crafted agreen building masterplanto reduce the carbon footprint of the built environment sector, which accounts for 20 per cent of the country's emissions."", 'the issue is that the process of tearing down and re-building is highly carbon-intensive, and especially wasteful when developments in good condition are demolished, said experts cna spoke to.', '""it\'s not the building\'s fault it has to die""buildings in singapore have shorter average lifespans than in other cities, said professor thomas schroepfer, who teaches architecture and sustainable design at the singapore university of technology and design.', '""when buildings are torn down, it\'s not necessarily because one cannot live there, but often it\'s economic drivers.', '""it\'s not the building\'s fault it has to die .', '.', '.', 'particularly, because of a lack of development land, the pressure is really high to build bigger, denser, modern buildings,"" he said.', 'theoretically, structures can last a long time, with the world\'s largest unreinforced concrete dome, the pantheon in rome, still in ""brilliant condition"" after some 1,900 years, said ms alexis chua, course chair of the school of design & environment at ngee ann polytechnic.', ""signs of wear and tear can start showing as early as within five years, but singapore's building guidelines also generally ensure developments can last many decades, she noted."", 'dr lee nai jia, deputy director of the institute of real estate studies at the national university of singapore added that buildings are usually built to last for the tenure of the land.', 'he added: ""while it makes sense to redevelop if the buildings become structurally unsafe, there were a number of developments sold en bloc that were less than 20 years old.', '""data he compiled shows that since 1995, at least 51 developments that have been sold en bloc were less than 20 years old.', 'he added that there are no specific laws dictating the age at which buildings can be demolished.', 'environmental price of constructioncycling through buildings before their time is up creates environmental problems, said prof schroepfer.', '""you have to take care of the debris from tearing down, there\'s steel, concrete, glass all materials that have high (embodied carbon), meaning it was very energy-intensive to bring them into life in the first place.', 'some of these are then recycled, but ""it\'s not like other industries where the recycling rate is much higher"", he said.', 'producing new materials, transporting them and starting construction kicks off the cycle all over again.', '""so in terms of life cycle analysis, the tearing down and rebuilding is very energy hungry, and therefore not good for environment,"" he said.', 'for context, about 40 per cent of global carbon emissions are already from building and construction, according to the world green building council.', 'operational emissions form 28 per cent of this, while embodied carbon emissions account for 11 per cent.', ""in singapore, where the lifespan of buildings is shorter due to urban renewal, embodied carbon emissions could go up to 40 per cent, the council's chair, lisa bates, toldeco-business."", 'why do en blocs sales exist at all?the main goal of the collective sales framework is to give owners a choice on whether to go for redevelopment – which could allow for rejuvenation and land use optimisation, the national development ministry told cna.', 'for instance: ""pipes start to leak, or you get analogue lifts and you can\'t get spare parts for these anymore, because people have moved on to digital lifts,"" said ms ong choon fah, the chairperson of the urban land institute.', '""even technicians may not know how to service these lifts anymore, so you need to keep these buildings maintainable.', '""in addition, when master plans raised plot ratios for certain areas in the past, en bloc redevelopment made sense, as they allowed developers to intensify land use.', '""now we are talking about20-minute towns, and with covid-19 .', '.', '.', 'the role of offices have changed.', 'these collective sales and urban renewal helps us move on with planning intents,"" said ms ong, who is also the ceo of edmund tie & company.', 'on top of that, as singapore\'s ageing population grows while household sizes dwindle, older developments with larger units may not be ""as relevant"", said mr wong xian yang, who heads research at cushman & wakefield singapore.', 'in fact, collective sales can even contribute to sustainability by refreshing outdated infrastructure with eco-friendly features, said mr wong.', 'this includes incorporating more energy-efficient ventilation systems, air-conditioning systems, household appliances, and introducing more greenery in the development.', 'to boot, it is often a way for older residents to cash out on their property as they prepare for retirement, ms ong said.', 'en bloc sales are also a way for developers to get freehold property.', 'the only other way to acquire land is through the government land sales programme, but these are leasehold plots.', 'cultural loss and social displacementthough the collective sale process has its merits, critics have also cited disadvantages beyond the environmental damage.', 'prof schroepfer said: ""remodeling of the city over and over would come at cultural cost.', ""even within a lifetime, the city – you can't recognise it anymore."", 'the places you grew up with are no longer there.', '""ms ong cited how certain iconic post-independence buildings such as pearl bank apartments have been cleared as part of the en bloc process.', 'such sales also often lead to the displacement of communities – especially for older residents who may want to age-in-place.', 'as for the argument about making better use of land, mr nicholas mak, who heads research and consultancy at era realty, said that plot ratios for most areas have not increased in many years.', '""(many of these buildings) are built to the maximum allowable plot ratio already.', '""this means that for (more recent) en bloc sales, it is not because there is plot ratio to be increased, but because there is money to be made.', '""changing en bloc laws?bearing these factors in mind, is there a need to change existing en bloc sale laws?in the past, 100 per cent consensus from owners was needed to put a project on the market.', 'currently, under the land titles (strata) act (ltsa), buildings less than 10 years old must obtain 90 per cent consent from owners before allowing the collective sale to go through.', 'those 10 years old and above require 80 per cent consent.', 'ruling out en bloc sales entirely for the sake of the environment or other factors would be too extreme, said experts.', 'instead, a more feasible change would be to tighten age requirements, said mr mak.', '""say, instead of below 10 years, make it 20 or 30 years, such that any building less than 30 years old will need a higher percentage of consensus.', '""another possibility would be to raise the level of consensus needed to 85 per cent and 95 per cent for older and younger buildings respectively, he said.', 'but other than that, there is little that can be done to discourage sellers from going en bloc, as the returns can be high, said dr lee.', 'indeed, a collective sale can give owners a premium of at least 40 per cent, compared to if they were to sell individually on the open market, said ms ong.', 'alternatively, given that the need for land is a driving factor behind en blocs, gls programmes could be ramped up to give developers more supply.', 'but this is may not be feasible in the long-run because there is a finite amount of state-owned land – and this varies from district to district, experts said.', 'for instance, supply is tight in the central business district.', 'rejuvenating without demolishinginstead, the best option may be to repurpose buildings that go en bloc, instead of demolishing them entirely, said experts.', '""urban rejuvenation is possible without demolition"", said prof schroepfer, pointing to examples such as the fullerton hotel, which used to be a post office.', 'ms ong also noted how the partially-conserved former national aerated water company has been integrated with a new residential development, jui residences.', 'leasehold apartment development tan quee lan suites is also housed within a refurbished old building.', 'government buildings that have been repurposed include the old hill street police station, which is now the office of the ministry of communications and information, and the old parliament house, which is now the arts house.', 'the concept of addition and alteration is also common in other territories, such as hong kong.', 'over in the united kingdom, a campaign – backed by 14 winners of the stirling prize, the most prestigious architectural award in the country – has also urged authorities to provide incentives for owners to upgrade buildings, instead of knocking them down.', 'but in the first place, buildings must be designed with ""long-term thinking"" to best facilitate the possibility of future conversions – and this requires an industry-wide change in mindsets, said ngee ann polytechnic\'s ms chua.', ""greening the building's life cyclethere are several steps that can be taken at each stage of a building's life to make it greener."", 'firstly, good workmanship and quality materials are the foundation in slowing future wear and tear, said ms chua.', 'energy-efficient systems should be factored in at the design stage.', ""the green mark framework, which measures a building's energy performance and impact, already requires baseline standards to be met by all new developments."", 'during the building process, more sustainable materials, such as timber, should be more widely promoted, said prof schroepfer.', 'to get more developers onboard with sustainable building, authorities could dangle the carrot of additional gross floor area as an incentive, dr lee added.', 'once the building is running, regular maintenance is important, said ms chua.', ""this can be taken a step further with pre-emptive maintenance via data analytics, which would prolong the building's lifespan."", 'when a building is torn down, demolition protocols have been put in place pushing the recovery of higher quality recycled materials.', 'but ms chua noted that ""the rationale of current protocols in place could be re-examined"".', ""for example, she said warehouses' traditional metal doors and gates are often dismantled as waste metal, instead of being given a new lease of life in another new building."", 'dr lee added that recycling waste should be further incentivized, while ms chua said more r&d efforts can be put into finding new ways to upcycle it.', 'all these moves may result in higher costs of development, warned dr lee.', 'this comes at a time when the construction industry is already suffering from an acute manpower crunch and rising prices.', 'these sustainable technologies will be expensive at the start, which is why the government plays an important role in supporting firms and start-ups exploring these aspects, he said.', '""(this would help them) achieve scale and lower the costs quickly over time"", he said.', 'striking a balancethe stronger sense of environmentalism that has emerged within society has seen the industry pay attention, experts added.', 'developers such as lendlease, cdl and frasers property have pledged to reach net zero carbon targets.', 'several local architectural and engineering firms have become founding signatories of a global petition, construction declares, committing to ""take positive action"" in response to the climate crisis.', 'amid an industry-wide push for more sustainability, green buildings are on track to becoming the default.', 'with these developments in mind, ms ong says a holistic approach is needed when squaring the merits of en bloc sales with their potential environmental impacts.', '""it\'s not binary and it should not be a zero-sum game, but rather, a delicate balance is needed,"" she said.', 'it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.']",data/2021-5-30.csv,"Myanmar junta moves civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, ex-president Win Myint

'all athletes and support staff attending the tokyo olympics this summer are required to sign a waiver 'entry form' which absolves the ioc and organisers of blame if that catch covid-19 a member of the philippines olympic team receives a covid vaccination ahead of the gameslater in the same section, the waiver reads: 'to the fullest extent admissible under applicable laws, i irrevocably release the [ioc and tokyo organisers] from any liability for any loss, injury, infectious disease or damage that i may suffer. 'although it is not unusual for athletes to waive certain rights at major sporting events, the ioc have not previously cited risk of death at a games, or sought exempt themselves from any responsibility in this way. the world players' association a global body representing sportspeople have previously called for no waivers, saying: 'the ioc and all others responsible for the games have a fundamental duty of care to protect public and athlete health from harm. 'former team gb rower, cath bishop, an olympic silver medalist who is now a leadership speaker, writer and consultant, told sportsmail: 'it's an extension of what already exists, the ioc protecting themselves and taking away athletes' rights, but what to me seems odd is it's not accompanied by increased support [from the ioc], about what would happen if you did get ill and had a long-term health issue coming out of this. 'that's the concern for an athlete, getting long covid for example, without assurances that you'd be medically supported. 'former gb olympic rower cath bishop said there were few assurances of support if an athlete suffers the effects of long covid after the gamesmedical experts, the japanese public and now of the games' biggest sponsors are queuing up to demand organisers pull the plug on this summer's olympics. bishop added that the ioc now acknowledging deaths could theoretically arise from the tokyo games is significant.  'look at how many people have died [with covid] over the past year around the world,' she said.  'it's a fatal illness and it's massively indiscriminate.  there are people who have died in their 20s and 30s.  it's not the majority but it happens. '[the new waivers] flag up the greater risks that are being taken.  the language up to now has been 'it's safe, it's safe, it's safe. ' now this is clearly telling us, it's not safe. 'dick pound, the longest-serving member of the ioc, insisted the games will go ahead, 'barring an armageddon', even as more than 80 per cent of japan's population is against the olympics going ahead.  the ioc and organisers insist the tokyo games will proceed despite a public backlashthe head of the japanese doctors' union has raised fears the games could even help create new strains of covid. bishop believes the ioc's determination to press ahead regardless is ultimately driven by money, specifically billions in tv cash that would be lost with a cancellation. 'it's totally being driven by a sense of 'we can't go back', and we'd rather crash than pull back at this point,' she says.  'it's just about [broadcasting ] contracts . . .  if you think about [ioc president] thomas back's 2020 agenda of credibility, youth and sustainability, that's in tatters now. 'you wonder what the longer term impact of that is, in terms of switching off audiences.  people won't watch it.  it won't be reported on [in the same way].  you've set quite a dangerous precedent there for the olympics not being the kind of event that brings the world together. 'it is expected that around 80 per cent of participants will have received covid vaccines before the games start.  around 80 per cent of participants at tokyo 2020 will have been vaccinated beforehand the tokyo organising committee had told sportsmail that they will also provide health insurance for participants during the games, but not after. an ioc spokesperson said: 'the safety and security of all persons attending the games is the utmost priority of the ioc and japanese organisers . . .  the entry forms have been actually in place for previous games, and have been updated to include covid-19 related considerations.  'this is really to provide transparency and ensures informed consent from the games participants.  in addition, the entry forms are consistent with standard practice of other big event organisers and the forms are within the framework of the law.

2021-05-30,"Facing a Covid-19 surge, doctors will be forced to decide who gets bed in ICU, says Malaysia health chief, SE Asia News & Top Stories.","read 3 articles daily and stand to win st rewards, including the st news tablet worth $398. spin the wheel for st read and win now. petaling jaya (the star/asia news network) malaysian doctors will be forced to make the tough call over which patient should be given a bed in the intensive care unit (icu) because of the sharp rise in covid-19 cases, the health ministry said on sunday (may 30). health director-general, tan sri dr noor hisham abdullah, said if active covid-19 cases exceed the capacity of the healthcare facilities in the country, doctors will have to prioritise icu beds. ""the health ministry has warned of possible scenarios in which doctors would have to make the difficult choice to prioritise icu beds for patients with a high recovery potential over patients with low recovery potential (poor prognosis). ""this is a difficult situation that we are all facing and the health ministry would like to call on all parties to work together,"" he said in a joint press conference with senior minister (security) datuk seri ismail sabri yaakob. dr noor hisham said the numbers of available beds in icus, covid-19 hospitals, as well as quarantine and treatment centres, were declining because of rapidly rising cases. the usage of icu beds for covid-19 patients was now at 104 per cent capacity, with 1,113 beds in use, while covid-19 hospital beds have reached 85 per cent capacity, with 10,190 patients currently hospitalised. as for covid-19 quarantine and treatment centres, beds were now at 65 per cent capacity, with 27,183 beds in use while ventilators were at 60 per cent, with 2,138 total being used, of which 39 per cent were for covid-19 patients. he added that the health ministry has taken the initiative to increase the number of beds in covid-19 hospitals and covid-19 hybrid hospitals by repurposing certain spaces in the hospitals into icu units. ""the kepala batas hospital field icu, as well as the proposed temporary takeover of the ukm children's hospital, are also among the steps we are taking to increase icu capacity. ""we are also collaborating with ngos that are offering medical assistance to open more icus in areas that need them,"" he said, adding that the lack of manpower is posing a major challenge to the ministry. dr noor hisham also said the health ministry has increased the quarantine period for travellers arriving from overseas. the quarantine period for five high-risk countries such as india, pakistan, sri lanka, nepal and bangladesh has been extended to 21 days. he also said malaysia might be able to flatten the covid-19 curve in three to four months, but this will require cooperation from the public to adhere to the standard operating procedures. an accelerated vaccination drive would also be vital to slow the infection curve. he said with the rise of new variants of concern (voc), the two-week total lockdown starting tuesday was necessary to reduce the number of cases and give front-liners much needed breathing room. adding to concerns, he said the health ministry had recently received information from vietnam about a new voc detected there, a hybrid of the variants first identified in britain and india. ""the new variants are concerning as they cause more infections and deaths. ""we must ramp up vaccinations and in june, we will be able to use over 10 million doses, this is necessary for us to do.

"" the changi airport cluster is currently the largest active cluster, with 108 cases linked to it as at thursday.  ms wadde is an imported case who was confirmed to have covid-19 infection on may 2, said moh.  she was detected when she tested positive during her stay-home notice at a dedicated facility. after ms wadde was identified as a dbs bank employee in online articles on tuesday, the bank clarified in a facebook post that she was previously engaged as a contract employee through a third-party vendor from june to july 2019. ms wadde is not currently a dbs employee, said the post. ""we hold our employees to the highest standards of conduct, both in person and online.  dbs is fully committed to supporting the national effort to contain the spread of covid-19,"" said dbs. checks by st found that ms wadde's linkedin and facebook profiles were no longer accessible. this article was first published in the straits times.  permission required for reproduction.

2021-05-30,Coronavirus storm engulfs Everest.,"mount everest guide buddhi bahadur lama has spent days isolated in a tent after testing positive for coronavirus, as an outbreak that climbers say is putting lives at risk sweeps base camp. he is one of four in his expedition team thought to have contracted covid-19 at the foot of the world's highest mountain, along with a growing number of others. ""this is not just our problem, it is happening in most of the teams at the base camp right now,"" the 35-year-old told afp. dozens of suspected covid cases have been flown out of the area and at least two companies have cancelled expeditions after team members tested positive. however authorities in nepal have yet to acknowledge a single case at the mountain, with the stakes high for the country's tourism industry after a covid shutdown last year cost millions in lost revenue. lama's symptoms are mild but he said some climbers were suffering more severely. the warmer weather that ushers in safer conditions for scaling everest and other himalayan peaks has coincided with a new wave of covid-19 infections in nepal. the country is reporting an average of 8,000 cases a day and the health system has been overwhelmed. over the last two months since the climbing season began, more than 1,000 mountaineers and their mainly nepali guides have been camped in the tent city. more than 350 have reached the summit so far this season, but some are still at base camp waiting for the next weather window. breathing is already difficult at high altitudes so the coronavirus becomes a major threat if symptoms appear during a climb. officials at a camp clinic say more than 30 people have been flown out for health issues in recent weeks.  some have posted their covid-19 diagnosis on social media. but the government says it is unaware of any cases. ""we have asked companies and officials to report to us if they have any covid cases but none has submitted anything yet.  we need an official report,"" said nepal's tourism department chief rudra singh tamang. ""if people have tested positive in kathmandu, it is hard to say where they got infected. ""there is also a lack of transparency among some expedition organisers about positive cases. 'lives at risk' -austrian expedition organiser lukas furtenbach, who was the first to cancel an expedition, said he had submitted a report to the government. ""there is an outbreak and there is evidence for that.  but the government is denying this outbreak and putting our lives and the lives of their own people, the sherpas, at risk,"" he said. last week furtenbach was waiting to begin his ascent and his team of 19 climbers had already started acclimatisation treks when the virus struck. one person in the group tested positive with a rapid test kit and the next day three sherpas also returned positive results. eventually, eight in the expedition were found to have covid-19, with seven confirmed by a pcr test in kathmandu. furtenbach believes they were infected on the mountain -- the only time his expedition was in close contact with other teams. the company has also helped other climbing teams test for the virus and two people have shown positive results. ""if someone dies up there with covid the families would sue us -- when we knew about the outbreak and were still sending people up.  this is a liability,"" he said. nepal suffered a devastating blow to its tourism industry last year when the pandemic forced a complete shutdown of its mountaineering sector. without foreign climbers, the sherpas and other guides -- who are often the sole breadwinners for their families -- lost their main source of income. kunga sherpa was evacuated from base camp after he tested positive and is now recovering in kathmandu. ""if we think financially, many need this year's earnings, but lives are important and perhaps, in a way, it would have been good to not climb this season,"" he said. pm/tw/axna 95-year-old singaporean woman died on sunday (30 may) from covid-19 infection, the ministry of health said on the same day. sri lankan authorities sunday said they will sue the owners of a singapore-registered cargo carrier which has burned for 11 straight days off the island's west coast and caused some of its worst-ever marine pollution. $6,600「」,$100「」british prime minister boris johnson married his fiancee carrie symonds in a ""secret ceremony"" on saturday, uk media reports said. gavin macleod, a veteran supporting actor best known for his role as an ever-smiling cruise ship captain on the 1970s-80s sitcom ""the love boat,"" died saturday at the age of 90. ukraine's ambassador to thailand died early sunday on the southern beach island of koh lipe while on vacation with his son, police said, with the cause of death still undetermined. smart,5%!$1,600,!us president joe biden's administration announced friday it will not return to the open skies treaty, which donald trump withdrew from, signaling a toughening stance against russia. the ministry of health (moh) on saturday (29 may) confirmed 33 new covid-19 cases in singapore, taking the country's total case count to 62,003. the ministry of health (moh) on sunday (30 may) confirmed the detection of 25 new cases of covid-19 infection in singapore, taking the country's total case count to 62,028. 《!》ut,!israeli and egyptian officials held talks in both countries sunday aimed at bolstering the cairo-brokered ceasefire that ended the latest deadly flare-up of violence between the jewish state and gaza's hamas rulers. the minimum occupation period is the period of time that you are required to physically occupy your flat before you can sell it on the open market.  the post minimum occupation period exemptions given to 4,500 households in last 3 years appeared first on icompareloan. vietnam has discovered a new covid-19 variant which spreads quickly by air and is a combination of the indian and british strains, health officials confirmed saturday. all asset classes.  industry-leading prices.  user-friendly investing online. the theory that covid-19 might be the result of scientific experiments has thrown a spotlight on the work of the world's most secure biolabs. prime minister lee hsien loong will deliver a live speech on monday (31 may) regarding singapore's approach to reopening while also controlling the spread of covid-19 within its borders. jessica liu, president of lazada group, is leaving the southeast asian online shopping unit of alibaba group holding ltd. $120$12,000,9,sc mobile!more than 20 horses have died of starvation in just one month at bangladesh's most popular resort district, the animals' owners said sunday, as the country's tourism industry reels from the pandemic's economic fallout. residents of a small french town laid cards and flowers saturday at the spot where a ""very kind"" and ""gentle"" policewoman was seriously wounded in a knife attack the day before, the latest in a spate of attacks on officers. six hundred russian soldiers requested by the central african republic this month are ""unarmed instructors,"" moscow's deputy ambassador to the united nations said friday. ,.   !the us customs agency announced friday it would block imports of products from china's dalian ocean fishing co for alleged use of forced labor and abuse of workers on its tuna vessels. russian president vladimir putin took belarus strongman alexander lukashenko for a boat trip on saturday as the close allies met for a second day and held ""informal talks"" amid the outcry after minsk diverted a european plane.

2021-05-30,"What we know about the origins of Covid-19, World News.","washington scientists are revisiting a central mystery of covid-19: where, when and how did the virus that causes the disease originate?the two prevailing competing theories are that the virus jumped from animals, possibly originating with bats, to humans, or that it escaped from a virology laboratory in wuhan, china. the following is what is known about the virus' origins. the wuhan institute of virology (wiv) is a high-security research facility that studies pathogens in nature with the potential to infect humans with deadly and exotic new diseases. the lab has done extensive work on bat-borne viruses since the 2002 sars-cov-1 international outbreak, which began in china, killing 774 people worldwide.  the search for its origins led years later to discovery of sars-like viruses in a southwest china bat cave. the institute collects genetic material from wildlife for experimentation at its wuhan lab.  researchers experiment with live viruses in animals to gauge human susceptibility.  to reduce the risk of pathogens escaping accidentally, the facility is supposed to enforce rigorous safety protocols, such as protective garb and super air filtration.  but even the strictest measures cannot eliminate such risks. to some scientists, the release of a dangerous pathogen via a careless lab worker is a plausible hypothesis for how the pandemic started and warrants investigation.  the wuhan lab, china's leading sars research facility, is not far from the huanan seafood market, which early in the health crisis was cited as the most likely place where animal-to-human transmission of the virus may have taken place.  the market was also the site of the first known covid-19 superspreader event. their proximity raised immediate suspicions, fuelled by the failure so far to identify any wildlife infected with the same viral lineage and compounded by the chinese government's refusal to allow the lab-leak scenario to be fully investigated. [[nid:530586]]scientists and others have developed hypotheses based on general concerns about the risks involved in live virus lab research, clues in the virus' genome, and information from studies by institute researchers. although the wuhan lab's scientists have said they had no trace of sars-cov-2 in their inventory at the time, 24 researchers sent a letter to the world health organisation (who) urging a rigorous, independent investigation. the who's first such mission to china this year failed to probe deeply enough, they wrote. a us state department fact sheet, released before the who mission in the waning days of the trump administration, alleged, without proof, that several wiv researchers had fallen sick with symptoms consistent with covid-19 or common seasonal illnesses before the first publicly confirmed case in december 2019. a may 5, story by nicholas wade in the bulletin of the atomic scientists, said lab scientists experimenting on a virus sometimes insert a sequence called a ""furin cleavage site"" into its genome in a manner that makes the virus more infective. [[nid:523873]]david baltimore, a nobel prize-winning virologist quoted in the article, said when he spotted the sequence in the sars-cov-2 genome, he felt he had found the smoking gun for the origin of the virus. what are the arguments for animal-to-human transmission?many scientists believe a natural origin is more likely and have seen no scientific evidence to support the lab leak theory. dr kristian g.  andersen, a scientist at scripps research who has done extensive work on coronaviruses, ebola and other pathogens transmissible from animals to humans, said similar genomic sequences occur naturally in coronaviruses and are unlikely to be manipulated in the way baltimore described for experimentation. scientists who favour the natural origins hypothesis have relied largely on history.  some of the most lethal new diseases of the past century have been traced to human interactions with wildlife and domestic animals, including the first sars epidemic (bats), mers-cov (camels), ebola (bats or non-human primates) and nipah virus (bats). while an animal source has not been identified so far, swabs of stalls in the wildlife section of the wildlife market in wuhan after the outbreak tested positive, suggesting an infected animal or human handler. has new information emerged to lend credence to one theory over another?the scientists' march 4 letter to the who refocused attention on the lab-leak scenario, but offered no new evidence. nor has definitive proof of a natural origin surfaced. us president joe biden on may 26 said his national security staff does not believe there is sufficient information to assess one theory to be more likely than the other.  he instructed intelligence officials to collect and analyse information that could close in on definitive conclusion and report back in 90 days.

                singapore, may 29 (dpa): singapore's pandemic-related restrictions are ""working"" and have helped to stall a slight rise in case numbers since last month, the city-state's finance minister, lawrence wong, said on friday (may 28). saying case numbers had ""even declined slightly"" since the rules were brought in two weeks ago, wong ruled out any ""further tightening of posture"" ahead of the june 13 end-date for the measures, which include limiting restaurants to takeaway or delivery, and capping attendance at events at 100 people. wong's ministry on friday announced an additional 800 million dollars in state funding for businesses affected by the retightening of curbs, adding gyms and arts education centres to the list of businesses receiving a 50-per-cent wage subsidy. the restrictions were imposed after singapore's health ministry reported a rise in ""unlinked"" virus cases and after travel from hard-hit india and neighbouring countries was banned, including for work permit and residency holders. singapore had up to then largely reopened domestically, after a short april-june lockdown last year. the health ministry reported 30 new cases of the virus on friday, taking the total closer to 62,000.  most of the cases reported since the pandemic's start came in mid-2020 and were among migrant workers. thirty-two deaths related to the virus have been recorded by the ministry.  dpa

2021-05-30,Sri Lanka to sue Singapore ship owners over marine pollution.,"sri lankan authorities sunday said they will sue the owners of a singapore-registered cargo carrier which has burned for 11 straight days off the island's west coast and caused some of its worst-ever marine pollution. police said a criminal investigation was also launched into the blaze aboard the mv x-press pearl, which was carrying 25 tonnes of nitric acid and a huge amount of plastic raw materials. the intense fire, still burning at the rear of the 186 metre (610 feet) vessel, has destroyed much of the cargo, some of which also fell into the indian ocean. tonnes of microplastic granules have inundated the south asian nation's famed beaches, forcing a fishing ban and sparking fears of ecological devastation. sri lanka's marine environment protection authority said it met with attorney general sanjaya rajaratnam on sunday to plan legal action against the owners of the vessel, its crew, as well as insurers. ""we have gone through the details and will be taking action against those responsible,"" mepa chairman dharshani lahandapura told reporters in colombo. she said they were, however, yet to make an assessment of the environmental damage, but she believed it was the ""worst marine pollution"" sri lanka has ever suffered. fire under control -sri lanka's navy chief, vice admiral nishantha ulugetenne, who was also at sunday's talks with the island's chief prosecutor, said the x-press pearl was still on fire, but the blaze was now under control. ""it will take a few more days to completely extinguish the fire,"" ulugetenne said, adding that his assessment was that there was no danger of the vessel breaking up. but he ruled out towing it away from sri lankan waters until the fire was completely put out and experts examined the vessel for any structural weaknesses. international salvage firm smit is leading efforts to douse the flames and is being assisted by sri lanka's navy and the indian coastguard. the three-month-old ship was heading to colombo from gujarat, india.  it had previously visited qatar and dubai and was due to go to malaysia and singapore after calling at colombo. the 25-member crew, who have already been evacuated from the ship, will be questioned on monday, police said. authorities said last week they believed the fire was caused by a nitric acid leak that the crew had been aware of since may 11. ""the captain and the crew were in quarantine, but health authorities have told us that we can question them from tomorrow,"" ajith rohana, a police spokesperson, told afp. ""we have already sent samples of polluted seawater and burnt debris from the vessel for a forensic report. ""the ship's owners, x-press feeders, said the vessel's hull remained intact and there was no damage to its fuel tanks. fishermen have been banned from the 80-kilometre (50-mile) stretch of coast, where tonnes of plastic pellets have washed up, sparking a massive clean-up effort. fisheries minister kanchana wijesekera said the government would compensate them for their expected losses. at least 4,500 fishermen were affected at the fishing and tourist resort of negombo, officials from the roman catholic church in the area said saturday as they pleaded for financial aid. priest sujeewa athukorale told afp on saturday that there were also fears of reduced demand for seafood from the area over contamination fears. aj/ohoa 95-year-old singaporean woman died on sunday (30 may) from covid-19 infection, the ministry of health said on the same day. british prime minister boris johnson married his fiancee carrie symonds in a ""secret ceremony"" on saturday, uk media reports said. smart,5%!$1,600,!gavin macleod, a veteran supporting actor best known for his role as an ever-smiling cruise ship captain on the 1970s-80s sitcom ""the love boat,"" died saturday at the age of 90. ukraine's ambassador to thailand died early sunday on the southern beach island of koh lipe while on vacation with his son, police said, with the cause of death still undetermined. us president joe biden's administration announced friday it will not return to the open skies treaty, which donald trump withdrew from, signaling a toughening stance against russia. $6,600「」,$100「」sri lanka faces an unprecedented pollution crisis as waves of plastic waste from a burning container ship hit the coast and threaten to devastate the local environment, a top environment official warned saturday. the ministry of health (moh) on saturday (29 may) confirmed 33 new covid-19 cases in singapore, taking the country's total case count to 62,003. the ministry of health (moh) on sunday (30 may) confirmed the detection of 25 new cases of covid-19 infection in singapore, taking the country's total case count to 62,028. 《!》ut,!israeli and egyptian officials held talks in both countries sunday aimed at bolstering the cairo-brokered ceasefire that ended the latest deadly flare-up of violence between the jewish state and gaza's hamas rulers. the minimum occupation period is the period of time that you are required to physically occupy your flat before you can sell it on the open market.  the post minimum occupation period exemptions given to 4,500 households in last 3 years appeared first on icompareloan. vietnam has discovered a new covid-19 variant which spreads quickly by air and is a combination of the indian and british strains, health officials confirmed saturday. all asset classes.  industry-leading prices.  user-friendly investing online. the theory that covid-19 might be the result of scientific experiments has thrown a spotlight on the work of the world's most secure biolabs. prime minister lee hsien loong will deliver a live speech on monday (31 may) regarding singapore's approach to reopening while also controlling the spread of covid-19 within its borders. jessica liu, president of lazada group, is leaving the southeast asian online shopping unit of alibaba group holding ltd. n1   09:00-13:00   91 | n2    10:00-14:00  716more than 20 horses have died of starvation in just one month at bangladesh's most popular resort district, the animals' owners said sunday, as the country's tourism industry reels from the pandemic's economic fallout. residents of a small french town laid cards and flowers saturday at the spot where a ""very kind"" and ""gentle"" policewoman was seriously wounded in a knife attack the day before, the latest in a spate of attacks on officers. six hundred russian soldiers requested by the central african republic this month are ""unarmed instructors,"" moscow's deputy ambassador to the united nations said friday. ,《》《》,,!the us customs agency announced friday it would block imports of products from china's dalian ocean fishing co for alleged use of forced labor and abuse of workers on its tuna vessels. russian president vladimir putin took belarus strongman alexander lukashenko for a boat trip on saturday as the close allies met for a second day and held ""informal talks"" amid the outcry after minsk diverted a european plane.

2021-05-30,Why scientists are concerned about leaks at biolabs.,"the theory that covid-19 might be the result of scientific experiments has thrown a spotlight on the work of the world's most secure biolabs. while the evidence linking sars-cov-2 to the wuhan institute of virology in china is strictly circumstantial, a number of experts want tougher controls on such facilities over fears that accidental leaks could touch off the next pandemic. here's what you should know. 59 top facilities -the wuhan lab belongs to the most secure class, commonly referred to as biosafety level 4, or bsl4. these are built to work safely and securely with the most dangerous bacteria and viruses that can cause serious diseases for which there are no known treatment or vaccines. ""there are hvac filtration systems, so that the virus can't escape through exhaust; any waste water that leaves the facility is treated with either chemicals or high temperatures to make sure that there's nothing alive,"" gregory koblentz, director of the biodefense graduate program at george mason university, told afp. the researchers themselves are highly trained and wear hazmat suits. there are 59 such facilities across the world, according to a report koblentz co-authored that was released this week. ""there are no binding international standards for safe, secure, and responsible work on pathogens,"" the report, called mapping maximum biological containment labs globally, said. accidents do happen -accidents can happen, sometimes at the top tier facilities, and much more frequently at lower rung labs of which there are thousands. human h1n1 virus -- the same flu that caused the 1918 pandemic -- leaked in 1977 in the soviet union and china and spread worldwide. in 2001, a mentally disturbed employee at a us biolab mailed out anthrax spores across the country, killing five people. two chinese researchers exposed to sars in 2004 spread the disease to others, killing one. in 2014, a handful of smallpox vials were uncovered during an food and drug administration office move. lynn klotz, a senior science fellow at the center for arms control and non-proliferation, has been sounding the alarm for many years about the public safety threats posed by such facilities. ""human errors constitute over 70 percent of the errors in laboratories,"" he told afp, adding that us researchers have to rely on data from freedom of information requests to learn of these incidents. 'gain of function' controversy -there is disagreement between the us government, which funded bat coronavirus research in wuhan, and some independent scientists, about whether this work was controversial ""gain of function"" (gof) research. gof research entails modifying pathogens to make them more transmissible, deadlier, or better able to evade treatment and vaccines -- all to learn how to fight them better. this field has long been contentious.  debate reached a fever pitch when two research teams in 2011 showed they could make bird flu transmissible between mammals. harvard epidemiologist marc lipsitch told afp he was concerned ""that it would create a strain of virus that if it infected a laboratory worker could not just kill that laboratory worker. . .  but also cause a pandemic. """"the research is not required and does not contribute to the development of drugs or vaccines,"" added molecular biologist richard ebright of rutgers university, one of the staunchest opponents of this kind of research. in 2014 the us government announced a pause in federal funding for such work, which gave way in 2017 to a framework that would consider each application on a case-by-case basis. but the process has been criticized as lacking transparency and credibility. as late as last year, a nonprofit received funding from the us on research to ""predict spillover potential"" of bat coronavirus to humans in wuhan. questioned by congress this week, francis collins and anthony fauci of the national institutes of health denied this amounted to gain of function research, but ebright said it clearly does. the path ahead -none of this means that covid-19 definitely leaked from a lab -- in fact there is no hard scientific evidence in favor of natural origin or lab accident scenario, said ebright. but there are certain lines of circumstantial evidence in favor of the latter.  for instance, wuhan is around 1,000 miles north of bat caves that harbor the ancestor virus, well out of the animals' flight range. scientists from wuhan were however known to be carrying out routine trips to those caves to take samples. alina chan, a molecular biologist from the broad institute, said there were no signs of risky pathogen research dying down in the wake of the pandemic -- in fact ""it's possibly expanded.

2021-05-30,"New rule on Covid-19 test for returning S'poreans, PRs not a straightforward matter, say experts, Singapore News & Top Stories.","read 3 articles daily and stand to win st rewards, including the st news tablet worth $398. spin the wheel for st read and win now. singapore a new requirement that singapore citizens and permanent residents (prs) must test negative for covid-19 before being allowed to return home from high-risk countries kicked in at midnight on sunday (may 30). infectious diseases experts say the move will help to protect front-line staff at the airport and could help to ease the load on singapore's healthcare system, which has had to deal with a spike in community cases in recent weeks. but they also note the measure has its limitations and implementing it is not as straightforward as it seems.  at least one legal expert has raised the issue of the constitutionality of the new requirement with the government. the ministry of health (moh) said last wednesday that, from 11. 59pm on saturday, all singaporeans and prs returning to the country will have to present a valid negative covid-19 polymerase chain reaction (pcr) test taken within 72 hours before their departure. this is the first time moh has required singaporeans and prs to take a pre-departure test. the ministry had previously said it did not want to make it difficult for them to return home, should they be caught unprepared by rapidly deteriorating pandemic conditions abroad. the immigration and checkpoints authority's (ica) safetravel website says those travelling by plane or by boat will have to present their test result at the air and sea checkpoints upon arrival in singapore. those who have stayed in lower-risk areas, including australia, brunei, china, hong kong, macau and new zealand, for the last 21 days are exempted. children aged six and below are also exempted from the new requirement. at land checkpoints, only prs entering singapore will need to present a valid, negative test result. prs who arrive in singapore overland without a valid, negative test result may be denied entry.  those who fail to comply with the new requirement may have their entry or re-entry permit cancelled. travellers must be tested by an accredited or authorised health centre in the country or region of departure. documentary proof is required and ica recommends that travellers ask for a copy of the pcr test report that is in english or accompanied by an english translation, contains the traveller's name, date of birth and passport number, and shows the date and result of the test. mr fin chua, 30, who has been living in thailand for eight years, planned to fly back to singapore next week to visit his father who lives alone. after hearing about the pre-departure test requirement, the business owner considered moving his flight earlier so he could return before the measure kicked in. ultimately, mr chua did not do so.  instead, he moved his flight back by two weeks to mid-june, citing the lengthy 21-day stay-home notice he would have to serve if he came back home now. mr chua feels that the new requirement is onerous as it is not easy getting a covid-19 pcr test in bangkok . he said a pcr test in the thai capital costs about 2,000 baht (s$85) at a government clinic and 4,000 baht at a government hospital, but it is hard for foreigners to get tested as thais get priority. the wait to get tested at the clinics can take hours, he said, unless one pays more to join a priority queue which means a wait time of 15 to 30 minutes.

ms cheryl wong, 30, who works in the film industry in new york, said she did not mind the new requirement as getting tested for covid-19 in the us city is easy and there are free services. ""if i lived somewhere else with less testing options and undetermined turnaround times, i'd probably be more annoyed,"" added ms wong, who is returning home on may 31 to renew her us work visa and to see her family after being away for 11⁄2 years. she noted, though, that the new test requirement did not appear to take into account singaporeans or prs who had already been vaccinated, or that individuals may still test positive even though they may no longer be infectious. she said: ""i'm pretty sure i'll test negative because i'm fully vaccinated and i am still cautious.  but there is that little bit of a what if. ""mr samuel phua, 23, who is coming home next month after graduating from the sibelius academy in finland, is also somewhat anxious about the pre-departure test. ""it is allergy season here, and pollen allergies and covid-19 have symptoms that are quite similar.  i got myself tested recently and my results were negative, but there's always that sliver of doubt and worry that the next one may be positive. ""but mr phua also said that the new requirement is an important step towards ensuring the safety of singaporeans both abroad and back home. dr ling li min, an infectious disease physician from rophi clinic, said the decision to require citizens and prs to take pre-departure tests before they are allowed entry would have been a difficult one for the authorities to make. limited access to swab testing facilities in some countries means that singaporeans living in places where covid-19 is raging may not be able to return home. but with the recent spate of unlinked community cases, dr ling said, the authorities now have several fires to fight and the new testing requirement will help to minimise the risk of the virus spreading in singapore. this is especially in the light of the fact that the changi airport cluster singapore's largest active cluster with more than 100 cases was traced to staff interactions with a family who flew in from south asia. while dr ling acknowledged that pcr tests may not pick up every single case, she said the mandatory pre-departure tests will at least help to identify those who are infectious and prevent the virus from spreading onboard flights into singapore. she added: ""it is evident that a key vulnerability exists from when passengers disembark until they are taken to their stay-home notice facility.  this measure would further reduce the potential exposure to the virus for that part of the journey. ""professor paul tambyah, deputy director of the national university of singapore (nus) yong loo lin school of medicine's infectious diseases translational research programme, also said the new measure would protect changi airport staff. ""if this screening reduces the number of infected people passing through the airport even by a small proportion, it might reduce the risk to staff in particular to those who, for some reason or another, cannot take the vaccines,"" he said. asked if the authorities should also extend the pre-departure test requirement to singaporeans and prs returning from lower-risk places, prof tambyah said it would be logical to mandate the test for everyone. ""taiwan and vietnam were previously considered low-risk places, as was the state of victoria in australia.  these classifications can change rapidly,"" he added.

professor teo yik ying, dean of nus' saw swee hock school of public health, said implementing the new requirement may be more challenging than anticipated. echoing a point made by prof tambyah, prof teo said not every jurisdiction will have commercial pcr testing capacity that is accredited and trustworthy. hence, there is a need to ensure that singaporeans and prs who intend to travel to singapore are able to access proper testing. otherwise, the testing requirement could be additional logistical hurdles for those returning as they would have to transit in cities where these tests are available, prof teo said. he added: ""it will not be useful if returning travellers simply pay for a substandard test or a forged negative pcr test certificate. ""there is also the issue of the government's responsibility towards citizens who test positive and cannot return home on a commercial flight. moh said travellers who test positive on their pre-departure test should seek medical care and ensure that they have fully recovered and are non-infectious before travelling to singapore. singaporeans who test positive for covid-19 while overseas and require urgent medical care can still return home via a medevac flight or any other equivalent form of conveyance. singapore management university assistant professor of law benjamin joshua ong noted that article 13(1) of the singapore constitution states that no citizen of singapore shall be ""banished or excluded"" from singapore. the courts have not ruled on the precise meaning of the words ""banished"" or ""excluded"", he said. ""it is possible that those words mean that anything preventing a citizen of singapore from travelling to singapore would be unconstitutional.  on the other hand, a court might also hold that it is acceptable for certain requirements to be imposed on citizens before they can return. . . ""i think it is at least arguable that, if the restrictions are too onerous, then those restrictions would in substance amount to banishment or exclusion,"" he added. prof ong said he has written to moh for more information about the precise legal basis for the new pre-departure test requirement. he also suggested that exceptions be allowed, citing a hypothetical case of a singaporean abroad whose overseas visa or work permit may be expiring but cannot get access to a covid-19 test in time to return home, putting him at risk of overstaying. however, smu law don eugene tan said that while at first glance it might appear that the pre-departure test requirement for singaporeans is in breach of article 13(1), this is not the case. ""while article 13(1) is not explicitly subjected to any derogations or restrictions, a citizen who is not in singapore voluntarily cannot be said to be banished or excluded,"" associate professor tan said. instead, the testing requirement only means that a citizen will not be allowed to board a flight or ferry to singapore unless he has a negative covid-19 test result.  if the citizen does somehow make the journey to singapore, he will unlikely be denied entry, prof tan added. ""in other words, the pre-departure test requirement imposes a duty on the flight or ferry operator to ensure that all passengers travelling to singapore have the necessary negative test results based on their travel histories.  the constitutional guarantee provided by article 13(1) is in no way under threat. ""

prof tambyah said there seems to be a reluctance to ban flights and replace them with evacuation flights like what was done with wuhan at the start of the pandemic. hence, the new measure is a logical option despite its limitations. prof teo said he believes that the singapore government will not leave any citizen in the lurch during a medical emergency, but stressed that individuals also need to bear responsibility should they choose to travel out of singapore while the pandemic is still raging globally. he added: ""this is really a reminder to singaporeans and prs that they should avoid unnecessary travel out of singapore during this period, and if they choose to do so, to ensure they have the necessary insurance coverage for covid-19 medical evacuation if infected.

before being allowed to return home from high-risk countries kicked in at midnight on sunday (may 30).', ""infectious diseases experts say the move will help to protect front-line staff at the airport and could help to ease the load on singapore's healthcare system, which has had to deal with a spike in community cases in recent weeks."", 'but they also note the measure has its limitations and implementing it is not as straightforward as it seems.', 'at least one legal expert has raised the issue of the constitutionality of the new requirement with the government.', 'the ministry of health (moh) said last wednesday that, from 11.', '59pm on saturday, all singaporeans and prs returning to the country will have to present a valid negative covid-19 polymerase chain reaction (pcr) test taken within 72 hours before their departure.', 'this is the first time moh has required singaporeans and prs to take a pre-departure test.', 'the ministry had previously said it did not want to make it difficult for them to return home, should they be caught unprepared by rapidly deteriorating pandemic conditions abroad.', ""the immigration and checkpoints authority's (ica) safetravel website says those travelling by plane or by boat will have to present their test result at the air and sea checkpoints upon arrival in singapore."", 'those who have stayed in lower-risk areas, including australia, brunei, china, hong kong, macau and new zealand, for the last 21 days are exempted.', 'children aged six and below are also exempted from the new requirement.', 'at land checkpoints, only prs entering singapore will need to present a valid, negative test result.', 'prs who arrive in singapore overland without a valid, negative test result may be denied entry.', 'those who fail to comply with the new requirement may have their entry or re-entry permit cancelled.', 'travellers must be tested by an accredited or authorised health centre in the country or region of departure.', ""documentary proof is required and ica recommends that travellers ask for a copy of the pcr test report that is in english or accompanied by an english translation, contains the traveller's name, date of birth and passport number, and shows the date and result of the test."", 'mr fin chua, 30, who has been living in thailand for eight years, planned to fly back to singapore next week to visit his father who lives alone.', 'after hearing about the pre-departure test requirement, the business owner considered moving his flight earlier so he could return before the measure kicked in.', 'ultimately, mr chua did not do so.', 'instead, he moved his flight back by two weeks to mid-june, citing the lengthy 21-day stay-home notice he would have to serve if he came back home now.', 'mr chua feels that the new requirement is onerous as it is not easy getting a covid-19 pcr test in bangkok .', 'he said a pcr test in the thai capital costs about 2,000 baht (s$85) at a government clinic and 4,000 baht at a government hospital, but it is hard for foreigners to get tested as thais get priority.', 'the wait to get tested at the clinics can take hours, he said, unless one pays more to join a priority queue which means a wait time of 15 to 30 minutes.', 'a pcr test in bangkok costs about 2,000 baht (s$85) at a government clinic and 4,000 baht at a government hospital, but it is hard for foreigners to get tested as thais get priority.', 'photo: epa-efe\nms cheryl wong, 30, who works in the film industry in new york, said she did not mind the new requirement as getting tested for covid-19 in the us city is easy and there are free services.', '""if i lived somewhere else with less testing options and undetermined turnaround times, i\'d probably be more annoyed,"" added ms wong, who is returning home on may 31 to renew her us work visa and to see her family after being away for 11⁄2 years.', 'she noted, though, that the new test requirement did not appear to take into account singaporeans or prs who had already been vaccinated, or that individuals may still test positive even though they may no longer be infectious.', 'she said: ""i\'m pretty sure i\'ll test negative because i\'m fully vaccinated and i am still cautious.', 'but there is that little bit of a what if.', '""mr samuel phua, 23, who is coming home next month after graduating from the sibelius academy in finland, is also somewhat anxious about the pre-departure test.', '""it is allergy season here, and pollen allergies and covid-19 have symptoms that are quite similar.', ""i got myself tested recently and my results were negative, but there's always that sliver of doubt and worry that the next one may be positive."", '""but mr phua also said that the new requirement is an important step towards ensuring the safety of singaporeans both abroad and back home.', 'dr ling li min, an infectious disease physician from rophi clinic, said the decision to require citizens and prs to take pre-departure tests before they are allowed entry would have been a difficult one for the authorities to make.', 'limited access to swab testing facilities in some countries means that singaporeans living in places where covid-19 is raging may not be able to return home.', 'but with the recent spate of unlinked community cases, dr ling said, the authorities now have several fires to fight and the new testing requirement will help to minimise the risk of the virus spreading in singapore.', ""this is especially in the light of the fact that the changi airport cluster singapore's largest active cluster with more than 100 cases was traced to staff interactions with a family who flew in from south asia."", 'while dr ling acknowledged that pcr tests may not pick up every single case, she said the mandatory pre-departure tests will at least help to identify those who are infectious and prevent the virus from spreading onboard flights into singapore.', 'she added: ""it is evident that a key vulnerability exists from when passengers disembark until they are taken to their stay-home notice facility.', 'this measure would further reduce the potential exposure to the virus for that part of the journey.', '""professor paul tambyah, deputy director of the national university of singapore (nus) yong loo lin school of medicine\'s infectious diseases translational research programme, also said the new measure would protect changi airport staff.', '""if this screening reduces the number of infected people passing through the airport even by a small proportion, it might reduce the risk to staff in particular to those who, for some reason or another, cannot take the vaccines,"" he said.', 'asked if the authorities should also extend the pre-departure test requirement to singaporeans and prs returning from lower-risk places, prof tambyah said it would be logical to mandate the test for everyone.', '""taiwan and vietnam were previously considered low-risk places, as was the state of victoria in australia.', 'these classifications can change rapidly,"" he added.', 'the new measure would protect changi airport staff, says professor paul tambyah.', ""st photo: mark cheong\nprofessor teo yik ying, dean of nus' saw swee hock school of public health, said implementing the new requirement may be more challenging than anticipated."", 'echoing a point made by prof tambyah, prof teo said not every jurisdiction will have commercial pcr testing capacity that is accredited and trustworthy.', 'hence, there is a need to ensure that singaporeans and prs who intend to travel to singapore are able to access proper testing.', 'otherwise, the testing requirement could be additional logistical hurdles for those returning as they would have to transit in cities where these tests are available, prof teo said.', 'he added: ""it will not be useful if returning travellers simply pay for a substandard test or a forged negative pcr test certificate.', '""there is also the issue of the government\'s responsibility towards citizens who test positive and cannot return home on a commercial flight.', 'moh said travellers who test positive on their pre-departure test should seek medical care and ensure that they have fully recovered and are non-infectious before travelling to singapore.', 'singaporeans who test positive for covid-19 while overseas and require urgent medical care can still return home via a medevac flight or any other equivalent form of conveyance.', 'singapore management university assistant professor of law benjamin joshua ong noted that article 13(1) of the singapore constitution states that no citizen of singapore shall be ""banished or excluded"" from singapore.', 'the courts have not ruled on the precise meaning of the words ""banished"" or ""excluded"", he said.', '""it is possible that those words mean that anything preventing a citizen of singapore from travelling to singapore would be unconstitutional.', 'on the other hand, a court might also hold that it is acceptable for certain requirements to be imposed on citizens before they can return.', '.', '.', '""i think it is at least arguable that, if the restrictions are too onerous, then those restrictions would in substance amount to banishment or exclusion,"" he added.', 'prof ong said he has written to moh for more information about the precise legal basis for the new pre-departure test requirement.', 'he also suggested that exceptions be allowed, citing a hypothetical case of a singaporean abroad whose overseas visa or work permit may be expiring but cannot get access to a covid-19 test in time to return home, putting him at risk of overstaying.', 'however, smu law don eugene tan said that while at first glance it might appear that the pre-departure test requirement for singaporeans is in breach of article 13(1), this is not the case.', '""while article 13(1) is not explicitly subjected to any derogations or restrictions, a citizen who is not in singapore voluntarily cannot be said to be banished or excluded,"" associate professor tan said.', 'instead, the testing requirement only means that a citizen will not be allowed to board a flight or ferry to singapore unless he has a negative covid-19 test result.', 'if the citizen does somehow make the journey to singapore, he will unlikely be denied entry, prof tan added.', '""in other words, the pre-departure test requirement imposes a duty on the flight or ferry operator to ensure that all passengers travelling to singapore have the necessary negative test results based on their travel histories.', 'the constitutional guarantee provided by article 13(1) is in no way under threat. ""', 'travellers should ensure that they have fully recovered and are non-infectious before travelling to singapore.', 'st photo: mark cheong\nprof tambyah said there seems to be a reluctance to ban flights and replace them with evacuation flights like what was done with wuhan at the start of the pandemic.', 'hence, the new measure is a logical option despite its limitations.', 'prof teo said he believes that the singapore government will not leave any citizen in the lurch during a medical emergency, but stressed that individuals also need to bear responsibility should they choose to travel out of singapore while the pandemic is still raging globally.', 'he added: ""this is really a reminder to singaporeans and prs that they should avoid unnecessary travel out of singapore during this period, and if they choose to do so, to ensure they have the necessary insurance coverage for covid-19 medical evacuation if infected.', '""join st\'s telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.', 'sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.', 'no.', '198402868e.', 'all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.', 'until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.', 'but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.']",data/2021-5-30.csv,"Myanmar junta moves civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, ex-president Win Myint to 'unknown location', SE Asia News & Top Stories."

""former national swimmer gary tan was just as saddened by the news as he recalled the time he was a 12-year-old csc swimmer and a beneficiary of lee's kindness more than two decades ago. now the national training centre head coach, he told the straits times: ""csc had organised a training camp in the united states for over 50 swimmers, and edwin dipped into his own pocket to help fund the trip for around half of the group who needed the assistance, so that we could all improve from the programme. ""and even later on, when i became a national swimmer and was studying and training in america, we would still keep in close contact as he checked on how i was doing. ""this is the measure of the man who has helped so many athletes on a personal level and given much of his time to help different local sports. ""while lee was never a national athlete he used to play rugby when he was studying in australia he nonetheless left an indelible mark on singapore sport. he was involved with the singapore table tennis association for over 20 years and while there, he started the sport's foreign talent scheme along with then-deputy president terry tan.  this eventually led to singapore earning a silver medal at the 2008 beijing olympics the nation's first at the games since weightlifter tan howe liang's silver medal in 1960 and two bronze medals at london 2012.  in between, a historic world team championship was secured in 2010. the director of property development company lee kim tah holdings was also singapore tennis association president from 2000 to 2015. minister for culture, community and youth edwin tong said in a facebook post that he was ""shocked to learn of the wholly unexpected passing"" of lee and that he and his ministry joined the snoc in mourning lee's passing. he hailed lee as ""a passionate, dedicated stalwart"" of the local fraternity and said his ""exuberance towards singapore sport was infectious and heartwarming"". ""the sporting community has lost a passionate champion and respected leader.  we will miss him greatly.  our deepest condolences to edwin's family,"" he added. snoc president tan chuan-jin remembered lee as ""no-nonsense and straight-talking"", but also someone with ""a great sense of humour and a heart of gold"". he said: ""edwin was an invaluable part of our team at snoc.  not only was he our treasurer, he was also our trusted resource person to help sort out awkward and difficult issues.  he was involved with sports for quite some time and contributed richly. ""he was kind and generous with those around him and cared deeply for our athletes and for sports in singapore.  we will miss him dearly. ""one such difficult issue was the leadership of the stf, which saw the mass resignation of seven committee members, including then-president kwee, in 2018.  on top of that, the federation was suspended by both the snoc and world taekwondo, the sport's global governing body.  it has yet to be reinstated. it was also embroiled in legal issues with its former secretary-general wong liang ming. lee volunteered to work to restore the standing of the beleaguered federation and was subsequently elected last year. international olympic committee vice-president and snoc executive committee member ng ser miang mourned the loss of ""an extremely dear friend who is like a brother"". having known lee in the 1980s when the duo helped to reshape the automobile association of singapore, ng said: ""no words can express the sadness and pain of the loss.  edwin was a great sports leader. . .  and also a generous man who contributed to many worthy causes and helped many in need.

dr karenne tun, director of the national parks board's (nparks) national biodiversity centre, identified the eagle ray species as the white-spotted eagle ray, or aetobatus ocellatus. national university of singapore (nus) marine biologist huang danwei said three species of eagle rays have been recorded in singapore, of which the white-spotted eagle ray is the most frequently detected. it is classified as a vulnerable species on the international union for conservation of nature's red list of threatened species. this means that the animal is at risk of extinction, said assistant professor huang, who is from nus' department of biological sciences. this is not the first time that a ray was caught by anglers in singapore. in july last year, a huge 80kg honeycomb whipray was caught at bedok jetty, after a three-hour tussle with an angler.  video clips of the gigantic ray being sliced up were also shared online. mr kelvin lim, curator of vertebrate collections at the lee kong chian natural history museum in nus, said leisure fishermen are usually unable to tell if they have caught an endangered fish, but if they do reel in one, they should release it if the animal is alive and not too seriously injured. ""the animals do get injured when they are hooked, usually at the mouth.  i do not know what the chances of survival are, but practitioners of catch and release believe that they are able to heal quickly,"" he said. however, if a large fish is impaled by a big hook, that is likely to cause more grievous injuries, he added. mr lim said the eagle ray would have been in distress the moment it was hooked, and its distress would have multiplied when it was pulled out of the water. prof huang said: ""we ought to avoid interacting or getting too close to threatened species.  rather, admire from a distance where possible to minimise further harm to them, and to prevent injuries to ourselves. ""dr tun said voluntary catch-and-release fishing – in which fish that are caught are released if not to be eaten – is one of the best practices for recreational fishing. ""this is especially for juveniles, and endangered and threatened species,"" she added. dr tun added that nparks and marine stewards singapore jointly developed an information board at bedok jetty to showcase the common fish species caught there, and to promote sustainable fishing practices.  the white-spotted eagle ray is included on the information board's catch-and-release list. ""responsible fishing practices will help us maintain our rich biodiversity and will allow the population to continue to thrive,"" she added.  mr lim noted that the people in the video clip who pulled in the ray seemed to know what they were doing to keep themselves safe and away from its stinging barbs. ""seasoned fishermen know to avoid the thrashing tail where the stinging barbs are.  members of the public should not go near a live stingray in distress and thrashing about because they may get stung by it,"" he said. prof huang said stingrays can have venomous barbed spines on their tails that can inflict very painful stings. in march, two beachgoers were stung by stingrays at sentosa beaches. prof huang added that the white-spotted eagle ray is widespread throughout the tropics in the indo-pacific region, and has been seen in singapore along the southern coast and southern islands. ""stingrays, including the spotted eagle ray, occasionally swim close to our shore and make for very amazing sightings. ""mr lim said the species can grow up to 3m wide and some of its notable features include its protruding head and numerous white spots.  unlike many stingrays that stick to the bottom of the sea, the eagle ray swims about, flapping its fins. he added that in south-east asia, the ray is caught for food and is also a popular display animal in large aquariums. late last year, a school of five eagle rays were spotted flitting along labrador park. eagle rays off singapore shores are labrador park! the first time i saw eagle rays was in indonesia so this is a real treat! one of the benefits of keeping our shores alive, more than rock and water, but thriving with lots of snacks and yummy stuff for marine creatures!🦈🐬🐟🐠🦑 pic. twitter. com/13duazrdwtprof huang noted that there have been more reported encounters of stingrays, jellyfish and other marine wildlife over the last two years. lethal box jellyfish have been seen gliding through sentosa waters and east coast park, among other places, since last year. prof huang said some reasons for more sightings include slight increases in the abundance of marine species due to natural population processes, and more people visiting coastal areas.

2021-05-30,"Fish in a 'responsible and sustainable' manner, says NParks, after angler catches eagle ray.","singapore: the national parks board (nparks) said on sunday (may 30) that members of the public are encouraged to fish in a responsible manner and to use more sustainablepracticessuch as the catch-and-release. ""this is especially for juveniles, endangered and threatened species,"" director of nparks' national biodiversity centre dr karenne tun said in response to queries from cna. dr tun's statement follows the emergence of a widely shared video on facebook of an angler in singapore reeling in what appears to be a white-spotted eagle ray at east coast park. the ray, which can grow up to 3m wide, is classified as vulnerable under the international union for conservation of nature red list of threatened species. nparks did not comment on the video or clarify where or when the ray was caught, but said ittakes a balanced approach on recreational fishing and works withother agencies to educate the fishing community to fish only at designated sites. designated fishing sites include changi beach park and changi boardwalk, east coast park, labrador nature reserve, pasir ris park, pulau ubin, sembawang park, west coast park and woodlands waterfront park. nparks said that it has also worked with sustainable fishing group marine stewards singapore to develop an information board at bedok jetty. the board showcases the common fish species caught there, ""as well as to promote sustainable fishing practices, including catch-and-release.  the white-spotted eagle ray is included in the 'catch-and-release' list,"" said dr tun. 'no fishing' areasto protect singapore's marine life and the more than 100 species of fish that can be found in singapore's waters, certain 'no fishing' areas have been designated for fish to flourish and grow to maturity, nparks said. these include areas such as the sisters' islands marine park, sungei buloh wetland reserve, labrador nature reserve's rocky shore, chek jawa wetlands, and the waters around coney island park. offenders can be fined up to s$5,000 for fishing in 'no fishing' areas in nparks-managed parks, and up to s$50,000 for fishing in nature reserves. nparks also works with other agencies to carry out joint enforcement operations in nature reserves and reservoirs to curb illegal fishing, it said. sustainable fishingdr tun said nparks has also worked with fishing communities and engaged anglers through community initiatives to promote responsible fishing and ""best practices for recreational fishing"". members of the public who fish recreationally should also consider more sustainable methods of fishing, dr tun said. each method of fishing from the hook, rod and line to fish traps and nets, ""has their own characteristics and varies in their impact on the environment"", she explained. ""fish traps and nets tend to be more indiscriminate, and when lost in the sea, will continue to trap and kill fish and other marine life. ""nets that settle onto the seabed could also entangle corals or other bottom-dwelling organisms, and can smother them to death. ""for this reason, net fishing and the use of wire mesh traps are not allowed in areas managed by nparks,"" said dr tun. nparks also encourages catch-and-release fishing, where fish that are not going to be eaten are released back into the sea. ""responsible fishing practices will help us maintain our rich biodiversity and will the population to continue to thrive,"" said dr tun. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

""they blew it up and cut out our faces, and used it as a way to celebrate hari raya, a cultural event which is not even related to the photograph. ""the pa explained in a statement that the radin mas constituency office (co) had engaged a vendor, warabi enterprise (art studio), to design and put up hari raya decorations at the tiong bahru orchid estate. the vendor came up with the concept and design for the decorations.  it downloaded and used the photo from an online source and then used it for a standee. the decorations, including the standee, were then put up by radin mas co.

""in the larger scheme of things, what does this reflect? the pa is meant to be a statutory board that seeks to promote social cohesion and harmony in singapore. ""in its statement, the pa said: ""this should not have happened.  neither our vendor nor radin mas co obtained any permission to do so.  this is against the policies which have been put in place.  we have since spoken to the vendor on the seriousness of this infringement, and will follow up with the appropriate steps. ""nonetheless, the pa, including radin mas co, takes responsibility for this error as we had oversight of the matter, and the decorations were allowed to be put up. ""the association added that it would take steps to guide and help staff and, as far as possible, external vendors, to be more culturally attuned and sensitive. ms sarah said she sent an e-mail on friday to mr yong, tanjong pagar town council and pa's chief executive director, mr lim hock yu. she added that mr lim replied to her e-mail and apologised, while minister for culture, community and youth and second minister for law edwin tong also apologised to her separately, via a private message.

2021-05-30,Myanmar's shadow government parades new armed force.,"yangon: the underground government set up by opponents of myanmar's military junta said its first batch of recruits have finished training for a new defence force, releasing video of them parading in uniform. the national unity government had announced it would form a people's defence force to challenge the army, which seized power on feb 1, ousting elected leader aung san suu kyi and plunging the country into chaos. the video of the graduation ceremony was released on friday (may 28) in the name of yee mon, the shadow government's defence minister. ""this military is established by the official civilian government,"" an unidentified officer says at the ceremony.  ""the people's defence force must be aligned with the people and protect the people.  we will fight to win this battle. ""a junta spokesman did not answer calls seeking comment. the military authorities say the national unity government is treasonous and that both it and the people's defence force have beendesignated as terrorist groups. the video shows around 100 fighters marching on a muddy parade ground in the jungle.  they march in new camouflage uniforms behind the flags of the new force, red with a white star.  they are not shown carrying weapons. nearly four months after the coup, the army is still struggling to impose order. anti-military protests take place daily in many parts of the country, strikes by opponents of the junta have paralysed business and fighting has flared with ethnic armed groups that oppose the junta and new militias formed to oppose it. two homemade bombs exploded in the main city of yangon on saturday, apparently targeting a police post and an army truck, the mizzima news service said.  it said one person speaking to the soldiers had been wounded in the second incident. the junta's forces have killed more than 800 people since the coup, according to figures cited by the united nations.  more than 4,000 people have been detained. junta leader min aung hlaing says the civilian death toll is nearer to 300 and has said around 50 members of the police have been killed.  he gave no figure for soldiers.  groups fighting the armed forces say they have inflicted scores of casualties. the army justified its coup on the grounds of fraud in an election swept by aung san suu kyi's party in november.  the allegations were rejected by the previous electoral commission. aung san suu kyi, 75, is on trial on a series of charges that her lawyers say are politically motivated. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-05-30,Coronavirus sweeps through Thailand's overcrowded prisons.,"a coronavirus surge sweeping through thailand's prisons has thrown the spotlight on the kingdom's overcrowded penal system, where some inmates have less space to sleep than the inside of a coffin. as of saturday, almost 25,000 people have tested positive inside jails, where inmates living cheek by jowl have been encouraged to keep wearing their masks even while they sleep. authorities have floated plans to give early releases to prisoners with underlying medical conditions and have announced funding for more testing and medical care in recent days. but former inmates say those behind bars have been kept in the dark about the seriousness of the outbreak. ""prisoners don't have the knowledge to protect themselves,"" said somyot prueksakasemsuk, a high-profile activist facing charges under thailand's harsh royal defamation law. somyot was bailed last month and told afp that he had not been tested for covid-19 once during his 10-week stint in custody. he was not worried about contracting the disease while in jail because he had no idea about the level of risk. ""but after this i'm so scared (for everyone still inside) . . .  if you are inside the prison you are at risk, it's unavoidable,"" he said. thailand's prison outbreak has skyrocketed from just 10 publicly announced cases a month ago and sparked growing public concern after a handful of prominent activists contracted the illness. among them was student leader panusaya ""rung"" sithijirawattanakul, who helped lead a series of rallies last year demanding political reforms in the kingdom, and who tested positive after she was released on bail. 'less room than a coffin' -the thai prison population stood at around 311,000 earlier this year, the international federation for human rights said -- more than two and a half times the system's official capacity. four inmates in every five are serving time for drug charges because of harsh anti-narcotics laws that can see offenders jailed for a decade for possessing just a few methamphetamine pills. many cells are so packed with bodies that some inmates only have half a metre (less than two feet) of space. ""that is less room for a body than the inside of a coffin,"" justice minister somsak thepsutin told local media in february. officials have tested more than 36,000 inmates in recent weeks and begun delivering covid vaccines to inmates and prison staff. somsak said he was examining ways to give early releases to prisoners with underlying medical conditions, possibly through a royal pardon. even if the plan goes ahead, prisoners will still have to complete a quarantine before returning home. ""for us to bail anyone or do anything, it has to be done properly,"" somsak told reporters on monday.  ""we can't allow them to spread infections. ""rights groups say the plan should go further and urged authorities to also free non-violent offenders in order to reduce overcrowding. ""authorities should reduce the detainee population. . .  of those held on politically motivated charges or for minor offences,"" said brad adams of human rights watch. bur-lpm/rma/gle/lba 95-year-old singaporean woman died on sunday (30 may) from covid-19 infection, the ministry of health said on the same day. sri lankan authorities sunday said they will sue the owners of a singapore-registered cargo carrier which has burned for 11 straight days off the island's west coast and caused some of its worst-ever marine pollution. $6,600「」,$100「」british prime minister boris johnson married his fiancee carrie symonds in a ""secret ceremony"" on saturday, uk media reports said. gavin macleod, a veteran supporting actor best known for his role as an ever-smiling cruise ship captain on the 1970s-80s sitcom ""the love boat,"" died saturday at the age of 90. ukraine's ambassador to thailand died early sunday on the southern beach island of koh lipe while on vacation with his son, police said, with the cause of death still undetermined. smart,5%!$1,600,!us president joe biden's administration announced friday it will not return to the open skies treaty, which donald trump withdrew from, signaling a toughening stance against russia. the ministry of health (moh) on saturday (29 may) confirmed 33 new covid-19 cases in singapore, taking the country's total case count to 62,003. the ministry of health (moh) on sunday (30 may) confirmed the detection of 25 new cases of covid-19 infection in singapore, taking the country's total case count to 62,028. yahoo,,,『,』,!israeli and egyptian officials held talks in both countries sunday aimed at bolstering the cairo-brokered ceasefire that ended the latest deadly flare-up of violence between the jewish state and gaza's hamas rulers. the minimum occupation period is the period of time that you are required to physically occupy your flat before you can sell it on the open market.  the post minimum occupation period exemptions given to 4,500 households in last 3 years appeared first on icompareloan. vietnam has discovered a new covid-19 variant which spreads quickly by air and is a combination of the indian and british strains, health officials confirmed saturday. $120$12,000,9,sc mobile!the theory that covid-19 might be the result of scientific experiments has thrown a spotlight on the work of the world's most secure biolabs. prime minister lee hsien loong will deliver a live speech on monday (31 may) regarding singapore's approach to reopening while also controlling the spread of covid-19 within its borders. jessica liu, president of lazada group, is leaving the southeast asian online shopping unit of alibaba group holding ltd. 《!》ut,!more than 20 horses have died of starvation in just one month at bangladesh's most popular resort district, the animals' owners said sunday, as the country's tourism industry reels from the pandemic's economic fallout. residents of a small french town laid cards and flowers saturday at the spot where a ""very kind"" and ""gentle"" policewoman was seriously wounded in a knife attack the day before, the latest in a spate of attacks on officers. six hundred russian soldiers requested by the central african republic this month are ""unarmed instructors,"" moscow's deputy ambassador to the united nations said friday. ,.   !the us customs agency announced friday it would block imports of products from china's dalian ocean fishing co for alleged use of forced labor and abuse of workers on its tuna vessels. russian president vladimir putin took belarus strongman alexander lukashenko for a boat trip on saturday as the close allies met for a second day and held ""informal talks"" amid the outcry after minsk diverted a european plane.
