2018-01-05,How parents tackle bedtime around the world,"it's a precious moment for families around the world when twilight falls, children yawn and bedtime routines engage.  yet the places where children sleep, the time they lay down at night and even how they prepare for shut-eye vary across cultures.   even differences in children's bedrooms around the world can be striking, as in venice-based photographer james mollison's photo series ""where children sleep,"" which has been adapted into a book.  though it has been nearly seven years since the series was published, the photographs still spark conversation as they turn a lens to bedtime around the globe.  while photographing the series, ""i met many families who sleep together in one room or children who sleep in a space of convenience, rather than a place they can in any sense call their room,"" mollison said.  ""i came to appreciate just how privileged i was to have had my own bedroom to sleep in and grow,"" he said.  ""i met children who had literally nothing except for a place to sleep and other children who couldn't move for all their toys. "" here is a sampling of what bedtime looks like in households around the world.  drastic differences in babies' bedtimes while researching children's sleep across the globe, clinical psychologist jodi mindell was surprised to discover significant differences in bedtimes for infants and toddlers based on where they lived.  she described the differences as ""unbelievable. "" ""when i walked into doing this study, i really thought we would see 10- or 15-minute differences,"" said mindell, a professor at saint joseph's university in philadelphia and associate director of the sleep center at children's hospital of philadelphia.  it turned out, however, ""we're seeing these 21‚ÅÑ2-hour differences between some countries like australia and new zealand with other countries like hong kong and korea,"" she said.  ""bedtimes ranged dramatically across cultures. "" mindell and her colleagues analyzed how the parents of 29,287 infants and toddlers, up to 3 years old, responded to questionnaires about their children's bedtimes.  those findings were published in the journal sleep medicine in 2010.  the parents were from china, hong kong, india, indonesia, korea, japan, malaysia, the philippines, singapore, taiwan, thailand, vietnam, australia, canada, new zealand, the united kingdom and the united states.  they completed the questionnaires between may and june 2006, september and december 2007 and april 2008.   the researchers found that the latest bedtimes were reported among parents in hong kong, who on average reported bedtimes about 10:17 p. m. , whereas the earliest bedtimes were reported among parents in new zealand: around 7:28 p. m. , on average.  the study was sponsored by pharmaceutical company johnson & johnson, and mindell has served as a consultant for the company.  bedtimes also appear to vary across european countries, said sara harkness, a professor and director of the center for the study of culture, health, and human development at the university of connecticut.  she was not involved in the sleep medicine study but has conducted research on children's activities and bedtimes.  ""we certainly did find in our research in spain that early bedtimes were not common for young children.  in fact, on one occasion, our spanish colleague invited us to watch preschool children in a performance at a local festival starting about 11 p. m. ,"" harkness said.  ""the most dramatic contrast we've seen to this pattern is in the netherlands, where babies and young children are put to bed at around 6:30 or 7 and expected to sleep through the night in their own bed, often in their own room,"" she said.   on the other hand, ""in small-scale traditional preindustrial societies such as the kipsigis people of kenya, where we did research in the 1970s, babies were always in close proximity to caretakers, generally their mother or an older sibling, and they slept anywhere and any time,"" she said.  around the world, there are not only differences in when babies snooze but in what happens before they slumber.  parents try it all to get babies to sleep in the united states, it's common for parents to prepare their children for bedtime with a soothing bath followed by a lullaby or, for older kids, a book.  yet around the world, bedtime routines involve a different approach, and in some places, they appear to be less common.  ""one of the biggest similarities is that most families include in their child's bedtime routine, for 0-3, some type of feeding, whether it's breastfeeding or bottle-feeding or snacks, and that's consistent across all countries, but if we take that out, there's big differences in activities like bathing,"" mindell said, citing her own research.  in the us, ""60% of families have a bath as part of their bedtime routine.  it's even higher in the united kingdom at 81%.  but somewhere like india, only 13%.  in indonesia, it's only 6%,"" she said.  ""they typically bathe in the morning or at another time of the day. "" there are also regional differences in which bedtime routines include prayers, mindell added.  ""in the philippines, 29% of families -- basically one out of three families -- include prayers as part of their bedtime routine,"" she said.  ""whereas some place like australia, only 6% did.  in indonesia, 30% include prayers as part of their bedtime routine. "" once the time comes to actually get some shut-eye, parents use different approaches to get their children to sleep.  in korea, harkness said, parents often sleep with their babies to help them drift into dreamland, but dutch parents tend to leave their babies alone in their rooms, where the children must learn to put themselves to sleep.  ""the dutch parents in our studies strongly supported a cultural rule of the 'three r's' of childrearing -- rust, regelmaat, en reinheid, or 'rest, regularity and cleanliness' -- which entailed establishing a firm routine featuring plenty of sleep on a regular schedule from an early age,"" harkness said.  who bed-shares, and who doesn't similar differences emerge among bed-sharing practices.  ""co-sleeping is the usual practice in preindustrial societies around the world where there are no special beds for babies to sleep safely by themselves.  co-sleeping on mats on the floor is a cultural norm in asia, where the family traditionally co-sleeps together in the same room.  mats are brought out at night, then stored during the day so the same room is both a living room and a sleeping room,"" harkness said.  ""we found more tolerance for co-sleeping for at least part of the night for babies and young children in european communities we studied, but this may have changed more recently following pediatric advice,"" she said.  in the united states, the american academy of pediatrics recommends against sharing a bed with your infant and says ""there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of devices promoted to make bed-sharing 'safe. ' "" ""the us parents seem to receive more strict guidance, especially from pediatricians, about avoiding co-sleeping,"" harkness said.  ""this is part of a larger set of advice about sleeping arrangements, including not using padded 'bumpers' around cribs, having the baby sleep on its back and not using covers such as quilts or blankets for babies -- all for the same purpose of avoiding the danger of suffocation. "" 'bedtime routines are the perfect package' all in all, bedtime routines can benefit a child's development, mindell said.  ""bedtime routines are the perfect package for not only sleep, but for promoting positive child development,"" mindell said.   ""children who have consistent bedtime routines not only sleep better, but it also promotes things like literacy, attachment, language, bonding and self-care -- all the things that we want children to have, whether or not they live in india or whether they live in the united states,"" she said.

2020-01-21,China confirms Wuhan virus can be spread by humans,"officials in china are racing to contain the outbreak of a new virus that has left at least nine people dead and sickened more than 440, after it was confirmed the infection can be passed between humans.  the spread of the respiratory virus to thailand, japan, south korea, taiwan, and now the united states, is fueling fears of a broader epidemic, as china enters its busiest travel period of the year.  wuhan, the central chinese city where the coronavirus was first detected, announced a series of new measures tuesday, including the cancellation of upcoming lunar new year celebrations, which had been expected to attract hundreds of thousands of people.  tour agencies have been banned from taking groups out of wuhan and the number of thermal monitors and screening areas in public spaces will be increased.  traffic police will also conduct spot checks on private vehicles coming in and out of the city to look for live poultry or wild animals, after the virus was linked to a seafood and live animal market, according to a report by state media outlet the people's daily, citing wuhan's municipal health commission.   the new measures come after chinese president xi jinping ordered ""resolute efforts to curb the spread"" of the virus monday.   there are now fears, however, that efforts to contain it are coming too late, hampered by a slow-moving chinese bureaucracy which failed to put sufficient measures in place in time.   in the coming days, hundreds of millions of chinese are expected to begin traveling across the country and overseas as the annual lunar new year break gets fully underway, compounding concerns of a further spike in cases.   though infections were first detected in wuhan in mid-december, infrared temperature screening areas were not installed in the city's airports and stations until january 14, according to state media.   more than 440 cases of the virus have been confirmed across china, with the majority in wuhan itself, but also as far afield as beijing, shanghai and guangdong province, near hong kong.   the death toll rose to nine wednesday morning.  among the victims are a 66-year-old man and a 48-year-old woman who died on january 20, according to the wuhan municipal health commission.  the majority of those who have died as a result of the virus have been elderly and had pre-existing conditions.   cases confirmed worldwide around a month after the virus was first identified in wuhan, it has already spread well beyond mainland china.   in asia, cases have been detected in taiwan, south korea, thailand and japan, while authorities in the us confirmed their first case on tuesday and there have been reports of potential cases in australia.   despite initial reports that the virus was unlikely to spread between humans, chinese health authorities have now said there is ""definitely human-to-human transmission. "" one patient is believed to have infected as many as 14 medical staff in one hospital, suggesting the disease can be spread far more easily than previously thought.  the specter of sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome), which infected more than 8,000 people and killed 774 in a pandemic that ripped through asia in 2002 and 2003, has loomed large over discussion of the current virus.   during the sars outbreak, chinese authorities initially downplayed the dangers and censored coverage, preventing people from realizing the severity of the virus and taking action in time to stop its spread.   zhong nanshan, an expert with china's national health commission who is investigating the wuhan virus, told state media monday that while it is not as serious as sars, the number of people with the disease was ""climbing"" and suggested that the ""death rate at the moment is not so representative. "" a study by researchers in the uk estimated that the number of infections in wuhan is still grossly underestimated, with the real number closer to 1,700, based on the spread of the virus to other cities and countries in a relatively short period of time.   us authorities announced the country's first confirmed case on tuesday.  the patient, a young man, had been traveling and arrived at seattle-tacoma international airport in washington state before health screenings for the virus began.  worldwide effort even before cases were detected in other countries, the efforts to contain the wuhan coronavirus were international.  wuhan alone has connections to dozens of overseas destinations, and beijing and shanghai have hundreds more.   airports across asia have stepped up temperature screening of incoming passengers, as have several hubs in the us with connections to wuhan, including new york, san francisco and los angeles.   with all indications that the virus has a relatively slow incubation time, however, these efforts may be insufficient to stop its spread.   ""you cannot absolutely prevent entry into the country of a disease like this.  the incubation period is probably a week,"" australia's chief medical officer, brendan murphy, said tuesday.  ""it's about identifying those with a high risk and making sure people with a high risk know about it and know how to get medical attention. "" he said that while there was no cause for immediate alarm, the true number of cases was likely far higher than currently reported and urged people to be vigilant about potential symptoms.   australian authorities on tuesday quarantined a man in brisbane who had returned from wuhan with possible symptoms of the coronavirus.  he will remain in isolation until his symptoms have resolved, queensland health authorities said.   raising concerns about how difficult it is to detect those with the virus, even if they have some symptoms, a patient in south korea told doctors there she had developed a fever and muscle pains on saturday and was prescribed cold medicine by a doctor in wuhan, before being sent on her way.  she was later confirmed to have the coronavirus during a check in seoul.   in the us, the national institutes of health is working on a vaccine for the new virus, though it will take at least a few months until the first phase of clinical trials get underway and more than a year until a vaccine might be available.  scientists in texas, new york and china are also at work on a vaccine, according to peter hotez, a vaccine scientist at baylor college of medicine in houston.   ""the lesson we've learned is coronavirus infections are serious and one of the newest and biggest global health threats,"" hotez told cnn.  the world health organization will convene an emergency meeting on wednesday to determine whether the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of ""international concern"" and what recommendations should be made to help manage its spread.

2021-03-25,Harris put in charge of migrant influx as Biden faces down critics,"us president joe biden on wednesday tasked vice president kamala harris with tackling an influx of migrants on the mexican border, aiming to take charge of a situation that has energized opponents of the new administration. ""i can think of nobody who is better qualified to do this,"" biden said at a white house meeting with harris and other top officials as thousands flee violence in impoverished central america. ""when she speaks, she speaks for me,"" biden said, adding: ""i give you a tough job. ""harris said there was ""no question that this is a challenging situation. ""it marks the first time that biden has assigned a specific portfolio to harris, who is seen as representing a younger generation in the democratic party and has been constantly at his side since they entered office on january 20. the administration also announced that the san diego convention center would become the latest shelter for the rising number of migrant children and it sent a team to tour an existing facility in texas. the convention center will accommodate up to 1,400 children, said a spokesperson for the office of refugee resettlement. in a sign of shifting national focus, the san diego center until recently had been repurposed for the covid-19 pandemic as a homeless shelter that permits social distancing between beds. speaking earlier to cbs news, harris acknowledged that the united states needed to speed up its processing of migrants' asylum claims and care better for them.

2020-02-07,"'A contaminated prison': Scared, angry passengers are trapped on three cruise ships amid coronavirus outbreak","it was supposed to be the holiday of a lifetime.   instead, american couple kent and rebecca frasure found themselves quarantined on a cruise ship, staring at ambulances lined up on land ready to receive the increasing toll of passengers diagnosed with a deadly virus.  on friday morning, rebecca, 35, found out she had tested positive for wuhan coronavirus and had to leave the ship immediately -- alone, as her husband kent, 42, was still apparently uninfected.   her only symptom when she tested positive was a cough.   ""it is terrible, i could never imagine that this could be happening right now,"" she told cnn shortly before she left the boat.  ""(the hardest part) is the unknown.  like, i don't know what's going to happen an hour from now. ""  the diamond princess cruise ship, on which the frasures were traveling, has been quarantined off the coast of yokohama, near tokyo, since tuesday, after a former passenger tested positive for the coronavirus.  there are more than 3,700 people on board, including 2,600 passengers, of whom 428 are american.  so far, 61 passengers have tested positive for the virus, and the quarantine is expected to last until at least february 19.    so far more than 31,400 people globally have been infected by the pneumonia-like coronavirus, which originated in the central chinese city of wuhan, and at least 630 have died, predominantly in mainland china.   three cruise ships in asia, including the diamond princess, have had their journeys disrupted or brought to a halt by the virus.  in the middle of the east china sea, the westerdam is struggling to find a port to dock at after being turned away from both taiwan and japan over fears of passenger contamination.  meanwhile, in hong kong, the world dream cruise ship has been held in quarantine since docking wednesday, after eight former passengers tested positive for the virus.  fear on the diamond princess after rebecca was diagnosed, kent says no one came to disinfect the room the couple shared.  he believes it is only a matter of time before he is diagnosed with the virus, too.  ""(but) you roll with the punches and try to make the best of things as you can,"" he said.  information from the cruise staff has been scant and he only found out that a further 41 passengers had been diagnosed with the virus after talking to a reporter, he said.  ""the only way anybody knows (what is happening) is when people that are infected tell other people they've been infected,"" he said.  american author gay courter is also among the more than 2,600 passengers trapped on board the diamond princess, which she described as a ""contaminated prison. "" ""(my husband philip and i) are 75 and 77 years old, we have health risks and we are a bad category to get sick . . .  we are not safe in our rooms,"" she said.  in an attempt to escape the infection, courter said she had contacted her insurance company, medjet, which is willing to send a crisis extraction team from the boat to evacuate her.   the us and japanese governments, however, won't allow that to happen.  japanese health officials told cnn that any passengers of the diamond princess had to go through the quarantine process before they were allowed onto land and that the process was ongoing.  ""we can be taken in quarantine, and extracted in quarantine and arrive in the united states safely,"" she said.  ""we are not sick at the moment but there is a major concern that circulating air on this ship can make people sick. "" courter said the us government could take them to the nearby okinawa military base for evacuation, telling president donald trump that he could have another thousand us coronavirus cases on his hands if the ship wasn't emptied.  ""this was a trip of a lifetime, and i used all of my credit card points.  the way out was divine but right now i do not mind how i go home,"" she said.   courter is afraid that if she becomes infected she may not survive.  older people are especially susceptible to the wuhan coronavirus -- china's national health commission said tuesday that 80% of all fatalities in mainland china were over the age of 60.   ""i (just) do not want to go home in a box,"" she said.    nightmare on board the westerdam the westerdam cruise liner left singapore on january 16 for what should have been a 30-day cruise around asia.  but after leaving hong kong on february 1, the ship has been turned away from the philippines due to fears that there may be coronavirus cases on board.  there is no suggestion that any passengers, current or former, have been infected.  australian passenger david holst, 63, who is traveling on the westerdam with his wife judy, said that the ship had briefly docked in kaohsiung, taiwan.  but on february 6, taiwan announced it would no longer allow international cruise ships to dock in its ports due to fears around the epidemic.  the westerdam left kaohsiung and was turned away from taipei as well.   the ship, which is operated by holland america, had been set to stop at five ports in japan, but on thursday the japanese government said that it would not allow the westerdam to call anywhere in their territory.   ""no one wants us,"" holst told cnn from the cruise ship, which is currently sailing through the east china sea.  ""holland america said they're in discussions with the us state department, the us navy, and the dutch government to try and find a solution.  i have no idea what that will be or when that would be. "" holst said he and his wife had spent more than $20,000 on the trip, including flights.  but he said the past six or seven days had been a ""nightmare. "" ""it keeps getting worse and everyone on board is just living in fear that the bell is going to ring and the captain is going to say, 'return to your cabins, we're in quarantine and we've got a virus case on board,'"" he said.  in a statement, holland america said it understood that guests on board are concerned and it was doing everything it could to protect their health.   ""we have implemented a significant number of measures.  our medical experts have been coordinating closely with global health authorities to implement enhanced screening, prevention and control measures for our ships,"" the statement said.   ""we have no reason to believe there are cases of coronavirus on board. ""  the company added that all guests would receive a full refund of their cruise fare plus a future cruise credit of 100% of their cruise fare.   holst criticized the ship for stopping in at hong kong and taking on new passengers there, despite the chinese territory having coronavirus cases.  ""people are angry, i think the tension is rising and everyone on this boat for the last seven days has lived under the dark shadow of wondering whether we have the virus on board,"" he said.  in its statement, holland america said it had followed us centers for disease and control guidelines at the time the ship docked in hong kong on february 1.  trapped in hong kong in hong kong, the 3,600 people aboard the world dream cruise liner have been under quarantine for three days after a number of passengers from a former voyage tested positive for the coronavirus.  three crew members have been evacuated from the ship for treatment in hospital.  chuang shuk-kwan of the hong kong department of health said that all passengers would have to remain on board until ""we complete the quarantine work. "" chuang said 33 crew members had shown symptoms of illness at varying degrees, although most had tested negative for the coronavirus.  before arriving in hong kong, the world dream had docked at several ports across china and vietnam.  on january 24, after visiting those locations, more than 4,400 passengers disembarked mostly to return to mainland china.   not long after, eight of those former passengers were confirmed to be infected with the coronavirus, potentially leaving the ship contaminated.  dream cruises has said it is attempting to contact passengers who had previously been on board the world dream ""to inform them of the situation and seek professional health assistance. "" there is no word yet when the world dream may be allowed to leave hong kong.

2020-09-27,Trump is stealing China's playbook to deal with TikTok,"the race to keep tiktok operating in the united states has turned into a saga of intricate dealmaking and political flattery.   it's exactly the kind of scenario that's already par for the course for american companies that want to do business in china (and for those, like facebook and google, that are shut out of the world's second biggest economy).  experts warn that the more washington's playbook starts to mimic beijing's, the more at risk the world's internet is of fracturing beyond repair with enormous implications for global business.   the deal to save tiktok's us business would see walmart and oracle take a minority stake in a us-based company called tiktok global.  while an announcement earlier this month implied that beijing-based bytedance would continue to own most of the short-form video app, developments since then have muddied the waters.    bytedance would itself hold zero percent of the new entity, a person familiar with the deal told cnn business earlier this week.  instead, tiktok global would be partially owned by bytedance's international and chinese investors.   the agreement would make oracle tiktok's ""trusted technology partner,"" and give the california-based tech firm the ability to store the app's american user data and review its source code.   other aspects of the deal have also become heavily politicized.  us president donald trump said last weekend that he asked the companies involved to ""do me a favor"" by bankrolling a $5 billion education fund to teach people the ""real history of our country. "" while it doesn't appear that such a fund will ever materialize, walmart and oracle have promised that the deal would coincidentally result in us tax payments totaling that exact amount.   for american companies that work in china, the broad strokes of this deal might seem familiar.  beijing often forces foreign businesses to form joint ventures with local firms and establish offshoot entities.   ""i think there is some era of retaliation here, where, 'hey, if you're going to do this to our companies ‚Äî shut us out or force us to localize ‚Äî then we're going to do it to you as well,'"" said dipayan ghosh, the co-director of the digital platforms and democracy project at the harvard kennedy school.  more similar to china than europe trump's threat to ban tiktok if the app is not sold to a us company is founded on the fear that otherwise, american user data risks winding up in the hands of the chinese government.  (tiktok has denied this as a possibility and says it keeps us data stateside, with a backup in singapore. ) the fight over tiktok has sparked a political firestorm in the united states.  but it's not exactly an unusual concern overseas, where governments have long been worried about how much access us tech firms have to information about their citizens.  that unease has increased in the years since edward snowden, a former contractor who worked with the us national security agency, revealed in documents leaked to the news media that the american government tapped into people's data through tech companies like microsoft, google and apple.  the european union has for years tussled with us companies over concerns about data privacy and surveillance.  that was a big part of the reason for passing 2018's landmark general data protection regulation (gdpr), which gave consumers much more control over their personal data and forced companies to ensure that the way they collect, process and store data is safe.  europe has continued to strengthen its privacy laws, and this summer struck down an agreement that allowed companies to move data between europe and the united states over concerns that it did not sufficiently protect europeans from us surveillance.   now that the united states has been forced to reckon with a foreign company that has broad access to us user data, though, the country is taking an approach that resembles china's far more than it does europe's.   american companies have known for decades that working with china requires a lot of sacrifice.  microsoft, which has a longstanding history in the country, agreed to give the chinese government access to its source code in 2003 to address national security concerns.  the company said at the time that sharing that information was intended to help foreign governments ""be confident in the security of the windows platform. "" the steps taken by other us firms that have access to chinese user data bear resemblance to the tiktok proposal in other ways.  apple's icloud services in mainland china are operated by a chinese company, for example.  the silicon valley firm was forced to do so to comply with the country's cybersecurity rules, which require companies to store data on chinese users domestically.  ""the us is copying what the chinese have done,"" said james lewis, a senior vice president at the center for strategic and international studies, a think tank based in washington, d. c.  ""trump is taking a nationalistic approach. "" a nationalistic america that way of doing things has consequences, though.   experts have for months been warning that tensions between the united states and china are creating a world where tech firms are viewed more as national actors instead of multinational ones.  and as the relationship between the world's two largest economies deteriorates, the fallout risks creating what eurasia group once called a ""new virtual berlin wall. "" ""the us was always about the international system and following the rules,"" lewis said.  ""a more nationalistic america is harder for everyone, not just the chinese. ""  after all, china's philosophy on technology led the country to create its great firewall, a massive censorship mechanism that shuts out content widely available elsewhere on the internet.  beijing closely monitors and manages that system, having realized the potential for the internet to impact the way its populace views the world.   when the internet was invented more than 30 years ago and became commercialized in the decades afterward, ""we thought of this as a platform over which any person in the world can communicate with anyone else in the world,"" said ghosh of the harvard kennedy school.  he added that closing off the web could sow division worldwide.   washington has increasingly indicated that it is willing to head down that path, though.  in august, us secretary of state mike pompeo said the government would seek to restrict the reach of chinese companies in the united states by banning them from app stores, cloud services and other digital networks.  ""what worries me is that the us is becoming china by trying to block off apps,"" said susan ariel aaronson, a professor at george washington university, where she directs a digital trade and data governance hub.  ""we too are censoring; we too are intervening in the markets for data. "" many experts have pointed out that the united states has legitimate concerns when it comes to safeguarding the data of american citizens.  instead of singling out chinese companies, though, they say the united states should develop universal standards for data collection and use.  ghosh, for example, said a european approach, like a us version of gdpr, may be the right way forward.   ""what that means is that if you want to do business with american consumers over the internet, you have to be subject to these general baseline privacy restrictions,"" he said.  that may include giving citizens the right to delete data or to be ""forgotten,"" a measure that allows citizens to request that links containing personal information about them be removed from search results.  whatever washington decides, though, the country's actions are likely to set a powerful precedent.  take india, for example, which has already banned a bunch of chinese apps during a broader geopolitical tussle.  ""if we continue to play the game of whack-a-mole with chinese apps that are perceived as a threat, i don't think that makes us anymore secure,"" said samm sacks, a fellow at the washington, d. c. -based think tank new america who studies cybersecurity and us-china relations.   ""i think that what that does is it creates a ripple effect, where other countries around the world will say, 'this is a blueprint on how to block a powerful technology company under the guise of national security.

2020-07-01,Why gay-friendly Taiwan is a creative haven for LGBTQ art,"around this time last year, taiwan was gearing up to host asia's largest ever pride parade having just become the first place on the continent to legalize same-sex marriage.   more than 4,000 gay couples have since taken advantage of the landmark legislation.  but beyond being able to tie the knot, the island's lgbtq communities are feeling the positive effects of the law in various other ways.  for taiwan's lgbtq visual artists, for instance, the past year has heralded new forms of creative expression, according to photographer su misu, whose explorations of gender identity, sexuality and bondage range from candid nudes to fantastical subversions of religious imagery.   ""more and more people are exhibiting their own self-identity, using their creative voice to express individuality,"" she said over email.  ""people are also beginning to construct the histories of the lgbtqi movement in taiwan, calling for others to participate and study it.  all this can help the gay community, which focuses on different issues, to thrive. "" even before the marriage legislation, lgbtq artists in taiwan enjoyed a level of creative freedom denied to their counterparts in many parts of asia.   beyond the legal rights of expression enshrined in its constitution, taiwan ranked 34th in the world (and 2nd in asia, after thailand) in a gay happiness index based on the experiences of 115,000 men from around the world.  a recent report on workplace equality by the island's oldest registered lgbtq organization, taiwan tongzhi hotline association, found that the territory's art sector was among the industries in which respondents felt ""most comfortable"" about coming out to co-workers.   coupled with the island's generous public arts funding, this atmosphere has produced a welcoming environment for lgbtq art.  and in 2017, just months after taiwan's constitutional court paved the way for the marriage law by declaring same-sex marriage a legal right, the gay art scene was afforded rare mainstream attention with the exhibition ""spectrosynthesis -- asian lgbtq issues and art now. "" billed as asia's first major lgbtq art show, the program featured over 50 works by 22 artists (from places including hong kong, mainland china and singapore, as well as the asian diaspora) addressing a range of topics, from forbidden love to sexual violence.  staging the show at a large public institution, taipei's museum of contemporary art (moca), meant that lgbtq art had a rare opportunity to reach mainstream audiences, according to patrick sun, founder of the non-profit organization behind the show, sunpride foundation.  ""if we do a show at a private gallery then i'm sure all my friends would come,"" he said in a phone interview from hong kong, where he's based.  ""but we want to talk to the general public. "" a 'political victory' for one of the show's participants, 44-year-old avant-garde filmmaker su hui-yu (no relation to su misu), the show represented a ""political victory"" that proved especially heartening for young artists.   ""in taiwan, it represented the changing of the wave (that) even a public museum would love to curate the show.  it's more symbolic in a political dimension than in (an) artistic one.  but i think it encouraged art students a lot. "" for su's generation, however, the gay art scene has long been flourishing.  although straight, his work has often explored lgbtq topics.  one of his most recent projects saw su film unrealized scenes from ""the glamorous boys of tang,"" a homoerotic fantasy movie featuring orgies, killings and an exorcism, that was released without parts of the original screenplay, as su believes they were deemed inappropriate in conservative 1980s taiwan.  ""there was already a strong tradition of queer study (and) queer art in taiwan since the 1990s (and) since the lifting of martial law,"" he said, over email, of the repressive military rule that formally ended in 1987.   it was this decade that saw the opening of lgbtq-friendly venues like it park and the gin gin bookstore, which has housed a gallery space in taipei for more than 20 years, alongside an explosion in gay literature, nightlife and academic discourse.  but while gay artists were free to practice their art, conservative attitudes persisted.  when same-sex marriage legislation was first proposed in taiwan in the early 2000s, it faced vociferous opposition.  so-called conversion therapy, a pseudoscience that attempts to ""treat"" homosexuality, remained prevalent (it was only formally banned in 2018).  organizers of a 2003 exhibition of works made by gay artists during consensual art therapy even felt it necessary to clarify in the show's notes: ""this exhibition is not to show lgbt people need to be cured. "" in the euphoric aftermath of the passing of the same-sex marriage bill in 2019, it was easy to forget that 67% of voters had, in fact, rejected the idea in a referendum a year earlier.  the taiwanese government pressed ahead with the law, though some rights enjoyed by heterosexual couples, such as cross-national marriage, are still prohibited.    for 36-year-old photographer 526 (a pseudonym pronounced ""five two six"") it was family pressures rather than societal ones that stopped him from openly practicing his art, which includes intimate portraits of trans and lgbtq subjects taken in their own bedrooms (pictured top).  ""even today, my parents are still afraid to tell their friends what i am doing,"" he said over email.  ""it's frustrating that even your parents can't see your value, or tell others that their son is gay.  i hope they can be brave, because . . .  we need stand out and let all the people know: we are here. "" nonetheless, he said that visibility of lgbtq art is getting ""better and better,"" and that taiwan's progressive environment ""makes it a good place to make art. "" he pinpoints the legalization of same-sex marriage as not only a landmark in his artistic identity, but in his life more generally.  ""i couldn't have imagined that (the law) would happen in my lifetime,"" he said.  ""if i'd known this would happen, i would probably not have stayed in the closet for 31 years. "" a beacon for asia the relative freedoms of taiwan's lgbtq artists come into sharp focus when compared to their asian neighbors.  in japan and south korea, there are no real legal restrictions, though conservative attitudes prevent their respective scenes from thriving in quite the same way.  at the other end of the spectrum, homosexuality remains a punishable crime in parts of southeast asia, including malaysia, brunei and some areas of indonesia.  in between, there are a number of places that ostensibly allow gay art to be displayed, but where censorship remains a significant barrier.  in mainland china, for instance, authorities have been known to periodically close down lgbtq exhibitions without explanation.  meanwhile in singapore, where artists are permitted to exhibit lgbtq-themed work despite the fact that gay sex is illegal (a law that is rarely enforced), censorship is also common.  in 2016, authorities removed a number of items, including sex toys, from artist loo zihan's exhibition ""queer objects,"" at the institute of contemporary arts singapore, due to obscenity laws.  (a few years earlier, loo responded to an age restriction placed on one of his shows by photocopying visitors' id cards and incorporating them into the displays. ) the idea that taiwan can serve as a beacon for the rest of asia was a key idea behind ""spectrosynthesis. "" speaking to cnn at the time, curator sean hu expressed his hope that the taipei show would have ""a ripple effect across asian society. "" indeed, a second edition of the show has since been held in thailand -- again at a mainstream, publicly-funded venue, the bangkok art and culture centre -- featuring almost three times the number of artists.  a third is planned for hong kong in 2022, with sun expressing hopes for them becoming a ""new normal"" in other asian cities.  with taiwan attempting to establish itself as a commercial arts destination (the launch of the taipei dangdai art fair in 2019 signaled that the island may hope to challenge hong kong's domination of the asian market), the island's gay artists could, in turn, benefit from the growing international profile.   one such artist, tzeng yi-hsin said she experienced an uptick in international inquiries after two of her images were featured in ""spectrosynthesis. "" ""i didn't get a lot of response or feedback from inside taiwan, but right after the show, i received more interest and approaches from people outside,"" she said, citing interest from japanese collectors and western media.  however, tzeng also expressed reservations about the exhibition's heavy focus on male artists.  only three of the 22 participating artists were female, with just one identifying as transgender.  (sun welcomed the critique, saying he ""took it to heart"" and is ensuring that his foundation makes ""a conscious effort to include female and transgender artists. "") for the 41-year-old artist and photographer, this curatorial decision represents a wider problem facing the arts in taiwan: that gay male artists continue to take a disproportionate chunk of the limelight.  ""the majority of curators and collectors are male, and, from my perspective, they are more interested in gay male art,"" she said, adding: ""we all notice that there are a lot of gay artists (in taiwan), but if a curator asks, 'who's a lesbian artist?' no one knows. ""  eschewing labels according to su misu, an oversimplification of lgbtq issues is another obstacle facing taiwan's gay artists.  she identified a variety of difficult or challenging topics that remain hard to address in mainstream forums.   ""issues deemed 'taboo' need more visibility, including drug abuse, aids, sex workers, transgender people, disabled people and bdsm practitioners,"" she said, adding that exploring these topics could help challenge ""inaccurate stereotypes about sex and gender. ""  art that conforms with the public's existing ideas about lgbtq communities will, she said ""only reinforce labeling minority groups. "" even the concept of lgbtq art itself may be a generalization said tzeng, who doesn't recognize the existence of a gay art ""scene,"" per se, in taipei.  while some of her work directly addresses lgbtq themes, much of it is unrelated to her sexuality, such as her iconoclastic images defacing classic paintings or photographs of pop cultural and political figures like former taiwanese leader chiang kai-shek.  ""i never identified myself as a gay artist.  i know my identity, but i'm just doing my own work. "" it's a point also raised by sun who, despite organizing lgbtq-themed exhibitions, said that artists' primary concern is ""not to be labeled in expressing what they want to say. "" but whether that means organizations like his might, in an ideal future, no longer need to exist, is a moot point given the widespread challenges facing asia's gay

2021-03-11,"5 things to know for March 11: Coronavirus, Cabinet, immigration, China, Russia","we're approaching the peak of tornado season, and the next few days will bring an increased threat of storms (oh, and flooding) to the middle of the us.  here's what you need to know to get up to speed and on with your day.   (you can also get ""5 things you need to know today"" delivered to your inbox daily.  sign up here. ) 1.  coronavirus  it's been one year since the world health organization declared the novel coronavirus to be a pandemic.  since that time, 29 million cases have been reported in the us, and 529,000 people have died as a result.  across the world, at least 118 million people have been infected and 2. 6 million have died.  president biden will make his first prime-time address to the nation this evening commemorating the anniversary and encouraging the american people to stay strong to beat the virus.  biden yesterday announced the purchase of 100 million more doses of the johnson & johnson vaccine.  and congress passed the stimulus bill, so it shouldn't be long before biden signs it and we start seeing its first effects.  2.  cabinet  the senate has confirmed a new wave of biden cabinet members.  merrick garland, who spent nearly 24 years as a federal appellate judge, was finally confirmed as attorney general.  he now faces tough decisions on controversial issues like the capitol riot, criminal justice reform and the fbi's russia probe.  rep.  marcia fudge was sworn in as secretary of housing and urban development, and michael regan will lead the environmental protection agency.  regan worked at the epa in the clinton and bush years and will be the first black man to head up the agency.  he'll be a lead figure in implementing some of this administration's aggressive plans to tackle the climate crisis.  3.  immigration  the overwhelming numbers of migrants arriving at the southern border, especially children, are challenging the biden administration's commitment to humanitarian immigration policies.  internal documents reveal thousands of unaccompanied migrant children are being held in us border patrol custody for more than four days on average in facilities unfit for minors.  the law doesn't permit such detentions exceeding 72 hours.  on average over the past 21 days, customs and border protection encountered 435 unaccompanied children daily, up from a previous average of around 340 children.  the biden administration is hoping to address the root causes of these arrivals by improving situations in central american countries and restarting a program allowing at-risk central american youth to live with relatives in the us.   4.  china  china's parliament has officially endorsed a proposal for ""improving the electoral system"" of hong kong, further restricting the ability of people in the self-governing city to freely elect their leaders.  under the plan, chinese officials will have the power to select ""patriots"" to run for office and govern in hong kong.  meanwhile, beijing has escalated a long-running diplomatic spat with the uk by summoning britain's ambassador to china over an article she wrote on press freedom.  china's ministry of foreign affairs lodged a complaint against ambassador caroline wilson, saying she misrepresented chinese media.  tensions between the uk and china have grown over issues including the political future of hong kong and human rights in xinjiang.  5.  russia russia slowed down the speed of twitter yesterday after the company failed to remove what the country's media watchdog described as prohibited or harmful content.  however, the move temporarily took out some russian government websites, including the kremlin and the russian parliament portals.  the sites are back up, but the russian government says the actions against twitter will remain unless the platform removes the barred information.  what information, exactly, is the government prohibiting? it relates to recent protests in support of opposition figure alexey navalny.  officials warned they would act against social media companies that didn't filter posts about protests the kremlin deemed as illegal or inciting people to demonstrate.  breakfast browse senators again introduce a bill to make daylight saving time permanent first some in georgia want to end it, now the senate wants to keep it.  listen, either we do dst or we don't.  just let us know before we change our clocks this weekend.   elon musk made $25 billion on tuesday meanwhile, we rescued some loose change from the dryer.   people traveling to thailand can now wait out their quarantine period on a yacht  mandated safety precautions, but make it fancy.   these epic girl scout cookie-inspired recipes put a new spin on classic flavors we can make you hungry in four words: thin mint mousse torte.   a utah woman found a 19th-century tombstone in her new yard congratulations, you've got ghosts!  happening later gun control legislation is back on the table the house is set to vote today on legislation that would expand background checks on all commercial gun sales, marking the first congressional move on significant gun control since democrats won the white house and the majority in both chambers of congress.  today's number 400,000 that's how many children are at risk of death due to famine-level conditions in parts of yemen, the un world food programme says.  about 47,000 people there are living in ""catastrophic"" famine-like conditions, and nearly half of yemen's population -- about 16 million people -- is living in ""crisis"" or ""emergency"" food security conditions.   today's quote ""stop talking about dr.  seuss and start working with us.

2020-10-30,Biden attacks Trump's Covid-19 response in South Korean op-ed and promises 'principled diplomacy' with North Korea,"democratic presidential nominee joe biden attacked president donald trump's handling of the covid-19 pandemic in an op-ed for a korean media outlet friday and promised to engage in ""principled diplomacy"" in pursuing the denuclearization of north korea.  in an op-ed published in south korea's yonhap news agency, biden criticized trump's ""failed leadership"" during the pandemic, claiming he has ""tanked our economy and shattered hope for many korean americans. "" visit cnn's election center for full coverage of the 2020 race ""president trump knew how deadly covid-19 was back in january and did nothing to control it,"" biden wrote.  ""more than 225,000 americans are dead.  some 30 million have lost jobs, hours, wages.  one in five small businesses have shut down, many of them korean american-owned small businesses. "" biden's op-ed was a direct and striking criticism of a sitting us leader in a foreign media outlet, and yonhap called the piece the ""first of its kind to a south korean media company in the year of the us presidential election. ""  the op-ed dropped just days ahead of election day in the us, where disarming north korea remains one of the most challenging foreign policy issues for whomever wins the white house.   the former vice president sought to contrast himself with trump's approach to diplomacy in the korean peninsula in his attempts to get north korean dictator kim jong un to agree to total denuclearization up-front.  ""words matter -- and a president's words matter even more.  as president, i'll stand with south korea, strengthening our alliance to safeguard peace in east asia and beyond, rather than extorting seoul with reckless threats to remove our troops,"" biden wrote.   view 2020 presidential election polling in comments made to donors, first reported by the washington post, trump, in 2018, appeared to threaten to withdraw us troops from south korea if he can't get a better trade deal with seoul.  the trump administration also previously sought to get south korea to pay roughly 400% more to cover the cost of keeping us troops on the peninsula.  in his op-ed, biden wrote that if elected he'll ""engage in principled diplomacy and keep pressing toward a denuclearized north korea and a unified korean peninsula, while working to reunite korean-americans separated from loved ones in north korea for decades. "" he added that as president he would work to fix the immigration system to provide a ""roadmap to citizenship for undocumented koreans,"" as he said about 2 million korean-americans have made ""innumerable contributions"" to the country.  ""as president, i'll continue to defend the american dream for everyone, so every korean american family has the same fair shot at prosperity and a better future,"" he wrote.  biden has been critical of trump's relationship with kim.  in a democratic primary debate back in january, biden said he would not meet with kim without preconditions, and that he would instead push china and other asian neighbors to pressure the country to abandon its nuclear ambitions.  build your own road to 270 electoral votes with cnn's interactive map trump met with kim three times over his presidency, first in singapore, then vietnam and finally at the demilitarized zone dividing north and south korea ‚Äî becoming the first sitting us leader to set foot in the hermit kingdom.  but negotiations have been at an impasse since.  pyongyang has not tested any nuclear weapons or long-range missiles since november 2017, but has continued testing shorter-range missiles that could be used to target us troops or allies in the region.  on october 10, north korea unveiled what analysts believed to be one of the world's largest ballistic missiles at a military parade on a significant anniversary in pyongyang.

2021-02-24,Japan increases protection for US military amid 'severe security environment',"japan's military performed 25 missions in 2020 in defense of us ships or planes, a sign of the growing integration of two of asia's most powerful armed forces.   the number of what japan calls ""asset protection"" missions was up from 14 in 2019 amid a ""severe security environment,"" according to an announcement from japan's ministry of defense.  the japanese military said the 25 missions involved japan self-defense forces (sdf) protecting us navy ships on four occasions while those ships were gathering information on ballistic missiles or other warning or surveillance activities.  in 21 instances, the missions involved protecting us aircraft that were in joint training with their japanese counterparts.  japanese authorities would not say when or where the missions took place, only that they ""contributed to the defense of japan. "" american and japanese forces participated in a wide range of exercises last year in and around japan and as far away as the indian ocean.  defense analysts said if a hostile power took on the united states military in any of the asset protection missions, japanese forces could hit back at that foe.  ""if american assets were suddenly attacked then the sdf would be expected to counter attack to prevent follow-up attacks on us vessels or planes,"" said corey wallace, an assistant professor at kanagawa university in japan.  however, japanese security expert narushige michishita, vice president of the national graduate institute for policy studies (grips) in tokyo, said it was unlikely the forces faced any real danger of hostilities.  ""certainly, some countries' forces conduct dangerous maneuvers during us-japan exercises, so the americans and the japanese might have experienced a few unnerving events on some occasions,"" he said.  but both experts said the sdf announcement indicates the growing importance of the us-japan security relationship amid a time of increased threats in the region, and it sends an important message to potential adversaries.  ""the point is that two forces are now regularly operating very closely together, and that they will be able to do the same in wartime or under stressed environment.  the capability to do so will certainly enhance deterrence against potential aggressive actions against japan, south korea, and even taiwan,"" michishita said.  ""it's a more dangerous (contingency) than was permitted six years ago,"" said wallace.  abe expanded japan's military options in 2014, then-japanese prime minister shinzo abe pushed through a ""reinterpretation"" of the country's pacifist post-world war ii constitution, which tightly restricted tokyo's use of the self-defense force, to reflect the security environment of the 21st century.  a year later, japan's peace and security legislation, codifying abe's plan to allow a larger reach for the sdf, became law.  under article 95-2 of the law, japanese forces are allowed to fire their weapons in protection of us military ships and planes.  any operation involving ""asset protection"" must be requested by the us military, be approved by the japanese defense minister, support the defense of japan, and may not take place in an area of likely combat.   the law was first used in 2017, when the japanese helicopter destroyer js izumo escorted a us navy supply ship, michael bosack, former deputy chief of government relations at us forces japan, wrote in the tokyo review academic journal that year.  the law, and the japanese missions under it, belie an assertion in 2019 by then-us president donald trump that japan didn't need to come to the aid of the us if america was attacked.  ""if japan is attacked, we will fight world war three . . .  with our lives and with our treasure,"" trump said, adding, ""if we're attacked, japan doesn't have to help us at all.
