2021-05-31,Osaka French Open crisis nears breaking point in tennis power struggle.,"paris: despite facing expulsion from the french open over a controversial media boycott, naomi osaka and her closest allies remained defiant monday (may 31) with no sign of a resolution to what is becoming a bitter power struggle within the sport. the japanese star has already been fined $15,000 for not honouring media commitments following her opening round win at roland garros on sunday. all four grand slams the french, australian and us opens as well as wimbledon closed ranks to threaten her with potential suspension from future majors if she does not relent. there is little indication that the 23-year-old, who claims press conferences are damaging for her mental health, intends to back down. ""anger is a lack of understanding.  change makes people uncomfortable,"" she tweeted after hearing of her sanction. wim fissette, the belgian coach of the 23-year-old, said osaka is ""concerned with fundamental issues she wants to bring about change"". ""naomi has the opportunity to use her status to address problems and to initiate things,"" fissette told german magazine der spiegel on monday. ""in the united states, athletes want more freedom in dealing with the press, so they are simply not threatened right away with punishment if they don't feel well for a day. ""the crisis, which could come to a head on wednesday when osaka plays her second round match, has sparked feverish reaction. osaka's sister, mari, wrote on reddit: ""naomi mentioned to me before the tournament that a family member had come up to her and remarked that she's bad on clay. ""at every press conference she's told she has a bad record on clay. ""not ok mentally""""when she lost in rome, she was not ok mentally.  she was completely shattered and i think everyone's remarks and opinions have gotten to her head and she herself believed that she was bad on clay. ""mari, a former tour player, later posted a follow-up message after herself receiving criticism for the wording of her original statement. ""my message has gone horribly wrong with people struggling for mental health.  i hadn't realised that naomi had a lot of shit to deal with and was fighting very honestly for the cause of mental health. ""now people are reacting like 'she can't stand criticism'.  sorry naomi, i probably made it worse. ""us tennis legend billie jean king attempted to strike a conciliatory tone, claiming that the media, while playing a crucial role in the sport ""needs to respect certain boundaries"". even the french open official website came under fire for what was perceived as a direct criticism of osaka when it tweeted photos of rafael nadal, kei nishikori, aryna sabalenka and coco gauff all smiling under the caption: 'they understood the assignment'. former world doubles number one rennae stubbs described the post as ""some serious shade"". ""making a player feel guilty & humiliating her is not a good look for a tennis fed,"" stubbs said. media boycotts at sports tournaments are not new. american football star marshawn lynch, when once threatened with a heavy fine if he skipped a super bowl press briefing, responded to 20 questions from reporters by replying: ""i'm just here so i won't get fined. ""grand slam tennis has witnessed a number of high-profile defaults over the years. novak djokovic was disqualified from the us open last year for hitting a line judge with a ball. john mcenroe was booted out of the 1990 australian open while jeff tarango was defaulted at wimbledon in 1995 after a furious rant when he accused the umpire of being ""one of the most corrupt officials in the game"". it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-05-31,All residents of Yishun HDB block to undergo swab tests after COVID-19 cases detected.,"singapore: all residents of block 745 yishun street 72 will have to undergo mandatory swab tests after six covid-19 cases were detected there. there is ""likely covid-19 transmission"" in the housing block, said the ministry of health (moh) on monday (may 31), adding that subsequent wastewater testing has detected covid-19 viral fragments in the block. the need for the mandatory tests was first announced by mp faishal ibrahim (pap-nee soon) in a facebook post on monday afternoon. ""this mandatory testing is carried out when epidemiology investigations have assessed that there is likely ongoing transmission.  it is done to prevent spread in the community,"" said moh. the tests will be done at the void deck of the block between 9am and 4pm, added the health ministry. ""leaflets will be distributed and sms notifications will be sent to the residents to provide them with more information,"" the ministry said.  ""residents are also advised to monitor their health closely and consult a doctor immediately if they feel unwell. ""the six covid-19 cases at the yishun block are from two different households. moh has identified two of them as cases 63461 and 63511 a chinese national and a malaysian respectively.  both men work at jin tai mart and are part of the jin tai tong food industries cluster.  the chinese national tested positive on may 19 and malaysian was confirmed to have covid-19 a day later. the other four cases cases 63661, 63701, 63702 and 63703 are family members who tested positive on may 23 and 24.  they are currently linked to the cluster involving case 63660, a 31-year-old singaporean man who is a property agent with era realty network. ""epidemiological investigations are ongoing to determine linkages and the source of transmission,"" said moh on monday. nee soon town council has done thorough cleaning and disinfection of the common areas at block 745 and the surrounding blocks, said dr faishal, who is also minister of state for home affairs and national development. moh also announced on monday that residents ofblocks 501 and 507 at hougang avenue 8will undergo mandatory covid-19 testing as well. while there are currently no confirmed cases living there, covid-19 viral fragments were detected in wastewater samples collected from those blocks. the blocks are not far fromblock 506 hougang avenue 8where covid-19 testing was conducted for residents on may 21 and may 22 after moh said ""a few"" covid-19 cases were detected there. a total of 405 residents and visitors of the block were tested, said moh on may 23. eleven covid-19 casesfrom at least four different households were identified at the block, with two of the cases picked up through mandatory testing. separately, all 243 residents ofblock 559 pasir ris street 51were also tested for covid-19 over may 23 and may 24, after four cases were detected in two households living in the block. with the latest announcements, there are now five public housing blocks that have undergone or are undergoing mandatory covid-19 testing for all residents. ""obvious chains of transmission""moh looks for ""obvious chains of transmission"" whenever cases in the community are detected, said the ministry's director of medical services kenneth mak at a covid-19 multi-ministry task force press conference on monday. ""when we pick up several cases that occur within a fixed geographic vicinity, then we have to be concerned that there may be also chains of transmission . . .  to other people that live in that same area,"" said associate professor mak when asked about the mandatory testing at yishun. ""this is the reason why we would then extend and carry out testing operations, in this case, in a housing precinct involving several blocks of flats. ""assoc prof mak said the ministry also reinforces its testing by ""looking at other data"", such as wastewater testing.  when wastewater testing indicates that there are people who are still shedding the virus, this raises concerns that they may be infectious to others, he said. ""this creates an urgency for us to launch these testing operations,"" said assoc prof mak. ""so we look at each cluster on a case by case basis, looking at the circumstances and making the decision whether we want to organise these testing operations. ""they're not easy to do, but it's important for us to do this aggressively in order to get ahead of the curve, and to try and make sure we get control to prevent further infection occurring to others in the community.

""this transfer mechanism recognises how harassment may occur against the backdrop of other ongoing proceedings, such as divorce (ones),"" it stated. various changes to the protection from harassment act (poha) in order to enhance protection for victims of harassment will also kick in on tuesday. a victim applying for a po against his or her harasser need not prove that a provision in poha has been contravened, if the offender has already been convicted of any poha or hurt-related offence against him or her. judges granting epos in egregious cases of hurt or harassment will now be required to consider whether a criminal investigation is warranted and, if so, refer such cases to the police for investigation. pos and epos will be extended to protect people related to the victim, as these individuals may also be harassed by the same perpetrator. the new changes to poha will also make it clear that domestic exclusion orders, which restrain the respondent from entering the applicant's residence or parts of the residence, can also be granted as part of a po. ""this will ensure better protection for victims who may reside in the same residence as the harasser,"" stated the press release on monday.   join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-05-31,"4 reasons the B1617 Covid-19 strain spreads so easily, Singapore News & Top Stories.","read 3 articles daily and stand to win st rewards, including the st news tablet worth $398. spin the wheel for st read and win now. singapore the b1617 covid-19 variant has infiltrated over 50 countries, outcompeted other strains and continues to infect.  it will also not be the last time the virus will mutate, experts cautioned. but what makes this strain, first discovered in india, so good at spreading?dr sebastian maurer-stroh, virus expert and executive director of the bioinformatics institute at the agency for science, technology and research, points out four features that the b1617 strain has in common with successful virus strains. he uses one of the three versions of the b1617 strain the second b16172 version to show what makes this virus different.  b16172 has appeared to overtake b16171 in local cases as well as those reported globally.  the third version, b16173, is rare. first, a little primer on coronavirus biology.  what you see in the diagram below is the spike protein of a coronavirus the little spikes that give the virus its distinctive shape. 
photo: a*star
the spike protein is a trimer three subunits joined together.  it is the complex shown in grey.  the green and yellow complexes are two different antibodies that bind to the spike protein.  the coloured circles represent the different mutations in b16172. characteristic 1: the virus' mutations help it to bind more easily with the ace2 receptorace2 is short for angiotensin converting enzyme 2, which is a receptor protein in the host cell. ace2 receptors are found in various parts of the body, including respiratory airways, and are used as entry points by the sars-cov-2 virus. the sars-cov-2 virus gets inside a host cell through its surface spike protein.  the spike protein and the receptors have a specific 3d configuration that enables them to bind to each other.  the virus attaches only to cells that have these receptors. the spike protein attaches to an ace2 receptor in the host cell before being activated by another enzyme. now, let's take a closer look at one of the subunits on the spike protein to see how its mutations have helped. 
photo: a*star
scientists think the l452r mutation and to a lesser extent the t478k mutation makes it easier for the virus to attach itself to the receptor and thus get inside the cell. if binding to the receptor is easier, the virus can get inside the host cell more easily and infect more cells. but being more infectious does not mean it can make people more ill. a more transmissible strain most often does not have more symptoms or lead to a more severe form of the disease. characteristic 2: decreasing binding to antibodiest478k and certain other mutations which are circled near the yellow antibody probably make the virus less likely to stick to antibodies.  in a full immune response, many types of antibodies work together. 
photo: a*star
though a decrease in antibody binding has yet to be proven for t478k, correlation was drawn based on existing data.  the e484k mutation found in the b1351 and p1 variants is located in the same region as t478k hence it is likely that there will be a similar effect. even though one mutation could slightly reduce the protection derived from vaccines and prior infections, it is insufficient to remove their utility. vaccination and natural immunity from prior infections are still very effective in reducing the chance of getting infected and spreading the disease, as well as protection against a severe form of the disease even in the case of variants. characteristic 3: a more stable spike protein
photo: a*star
the d614g mutation has been very successful in improving spike protein stability and is found in practically all strains of the virus.  d614g results in the spike protein adopting a more open conformation, which gives it more surface area to interact with the ace2 receptor, hence increasing its infectivity. a more stable spike protein can also mean more spike protein expressed on the virus surface, increasing its chances of infecting host cells. d614g has been linked to increased transmissibility and a higher viral load but not increased severity. characteristic 4: improving cleavage ratesthe spike protein needs to be cleaved into two units (called s1 and s2 units) to allow structural changes needed to enter into cells. 

the diagram shows the spike protein on the sars-cov-2 virus before cleavage and the right shows what it looks like after the s1 unit has dissociated. mutations like p681r could potentially improve cleavage rates and hence increase infectivity.  this has yet to be confirmed experimentally. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-05-31,Measures in place to ensure no food supply chain disruption during total lockdown: Malaysian minister.,"putrajaya: measures will be taken to ensure that food supply from the agriculture, fishing and farming sectors will not be disrupted during the two-week total lockdown from tuesday (jun 1), said minister for agriculture and food industries ronald kiandee. in a statement on monday (may 31), the minister said that follow-up measures and preparations will be taken to ensure that all agricultural and food industry networks and supply chains will not be affected when the first phase of the total lockdown takes effect. this is to make sure that the country's continuity of its supply chain and food security are safeguarded. ""mafi (malaysian agriculture and food industries ministry) is committed to ensure that the food network and supply chain in the country remain stable, sufficient and under control, as well as accessible to the public all the time,"" said dr kiandee. he said that sectors such agriculture, fishing and farming are essential services that are allowed to operate during the lockdown, subject to the approved standard operating procedures (sops). in its announcement on sunday, the malaysian government said that17 essential service sectors and 12 manufacturing sectorswill be allowed to operate during the first phase of the lockdown. agricultural, fishery, livestock, plantation and commodity sectors as well as their supply chains will also be allowed to run. according to the minister, based on the livestock commodity data, the supply of meat, chickens, eggs and milk is expected to be sufficient for the country. june figures show 22,590. 58 metric tonnes of meat, 125,067. 61 metric tonnes of chicken, about 976 million chicken eggs and more than 4. 1 million l of fresh milk. the estimated supply of 185,000 metric tonnes of fish per month is more than enough to meet the current demand of 155,000 metric tonnes of fish, dr kiandee said. the ministry also estimated a demand of 100,000 metric tonnes to 150,000 metric tonnes of rice during the two-week period, including in the event of panic buying. the supply can be met with the country's current rice stock, which stands at about 764,000 metric tonnes, said dr kiandee. to ensure that there is no disruption in the production and supply of rice, the minister said that mafi will make sure that paddy planting and mill operations can continue in accordance with the sops. ""rice distribution between wholesalers and retailers will be allowed to operate according to the sops, in order to ensure that no area or district will be cut off from supply,"" added dr kiandee. opening of specific economic sectors to ensure supply chain continuity: finance ministryin a separate statement on monday, the ministry of finance said the continued opening of specific economic sectors is crucial to safeguard the people's wellbeing and to ensure the supply chain continuity for essential products and services. noting the need to contain the covid-19 pandemic efficiently, the ministry said there is also a need to prevent any disruption to the manufacturing value chain that could threaten the continued production of goods and services feeding into essential industries. examples of essential industries are food, health and medical equipment, pharmaceuticals and telecommunications. ""learning from lessons of mco 1. 0, the government has also allowed the related value chain of essential goods, such as packing and labelling, to operate,"" the statement read. economically strategic industries such as the aerospace industry, oil and gas, manufacturing and electrical and electronics (e&e) sectors are also allowed to operate, it added. the e&e sector represents 40 per cent or rm386 billion (us$93. 6 billion) of malaysia's annual exports, and approximately 7 per cent of global semiconductor trade, the ministry said. ""for the e&e sector, for example, the government recognises the fact that thousands of components manufactured by this sector enable critical infrastructure globally, such as healthcare and medical devices, water systems and energy grids, as well as transportation and telecommunication networks,"" the ministry said. downloadour appor subscribe to our telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:https://cna. asia/telegramit looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-05-31,Three-child policy: China lifts cap on births in major policy shift.,"beijing: married chinese couples may have up to three children, china announced on monday (may 31), in a major shift from the existing limit of two after recent data showed a dramatic decline in births in the world's most populous country. beijing scrapped its decades-old one-child policy in 2016, replacing it with a two-child limit to try and stave off risks to its economy from a rapidly aging population.  but that failed to result in a sustained surge in births given the high cost of raising children in chinese cities, a challenge that persists to this day. the policy change will come with ""supportive measures, which will be conducive to improving our country's population structure, fulfilling the country's strategy of actively coping with an ageing population"", the official xinhua news agency said following a politburo meeting chaired by president xi jinping. among those measures, china will lower educational costs for families, step up tax and housing support, guarantee the legal interests of working women and clamp down on ""sky-high"" dowries, it said, without giving specifics.  it would also look to educate young people ""on marriage and love"". china had a fertility rate of just 1. 3 children per woman in 2020, recent data showed, on par with ageing societies like japan and italy and far short of the roughly 2. 1 needed for replacement level. ""people are held back not by the two-children limit, but by the incredibly high costs of raising children in today's china.  housing, extracurricular activities, food, trips, and everything else add up quickly,"" yifei li, a sociologist at nyu shanghai, told reuters. ""raising the limit itself is unlikely to tilt anyone's calculus in a meaningful way, in my view. ""zhang xinyu, a 30-year-old mother of one from zhengzhou, the capital of henan province, said the problem was that women bore most of the responsibility for raising children. ""if men could do more to raise the child, or if families could give more consideration for women who had just had children, actually a lot of women would be able to have a second child,"" she told reuters. "". . .  but thinking of the big picture, realistically, i don't want to have a second child.  and a third is even more impossible. ""in a poll on xinhua's weibo account asking #areyouready for the three-child policy, about 29,000 of 31,000 respondents said they would ""never think of it"" while the remainder chose among the options: ""i'm ready and very eager to do so"", ""it's on my agenda"", or ""i'm hesitating and there's lot to consider"". the poll was later removed. ""i am willing to have three children if you give me 5 million yuan (us$785,650),"" one user posted. share prices in birth- and fertility-related companies surged. ""too late now""early this month, a once-in-a-decade census showed that the population grew at its slowest rate during the last decade since the 1950s, to 1. 41 billion, fuelling concerns that china would grow old before it gets wealthy as well as criticism that it had waited too long to address declining births. ""this is without a doubt a step in the right direction, but still it's a bit timid,"" shuang ding, chief economist at standard chartered in hong kong, told reuters. ""a fully liberalised birth policy should have been implemented at least five years ago, but it's too late now, although its better late than never,"" he said. china's politburo also said on monday that it would phase in delays in retirement ages, but did not provide any details. fines of 130,000 yuan (us$20,440) were being imposed on people for having a third child as of late last year, according to a government notice in the city of weihai. fearing a population explosion, in 1979 china implemented its one-child policy, which succeeded in curbing population growth but also led to coerced sterilisations and sex-selective abortions that exacerbated a gender imbalance as many parents preferred male children. a study published earlier this year by academics from hangzhou university found that the two-child policy encouraged wealthier couples who already had a child and were ""less sensitive to child-rearing costs"", while driving up the costs of child care and education and discouraging first-time parents. su meizhen, a human resources manager in beijing, said she was ""super-happy"" to be pregnant with her third child. ""we won't have to pay the fine and we'll be able to get a hukou,"" she said, referring to the urban residence permit that enables families to receive benefits including sending their children to local public schools. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-05-31,Sri Lanka to sue Singapore ship owners over marine pollution.,"sri lankan authorities sunday said they will sue the owners of a singapore-registered cargo carrier which has burned for 11 straight days off the island's west coast and caused some of its worst-ever marine pollution. police said a criminal investigation was also launched into the blaze aboard the mv x-press pearl, which was carrying 25 tonnes of nitric acid and a huge amount of plastic raw materials. the intense fire, still burning at the rear of the 186 metre (610 feet) vessel, has destroyed much of the cargo, some of which also fell into the indian ocean. tonnes of microplastic granules have inundated the south asian nation's famed beaches, forcing a fishing ban and sparking fears of ecological devastation. sri lanka's marine environment protection authority said it met with attorney general sanjaya rajaratnam on sunday to plan legal action against the owners of the vessel, its crew, as well as insurers. ""we have gone through the details and will be taking action against those responsible,"" mepa chairman dharshani lahandapura told reporters in colombo. she said they were, however, yet to make an assessment of the environmental damage, but she believed it was the ""worst marine pollution"" sri lanka has ever suffered. fire under control -sri lanka's navy chief, vice admiral nishantha ulugetenne, who was also at sunday's talks with the island's chief prosecutor, said the x-press pearl was still on fire, but the blaze was now under control. ""it will take a few more days to completely extinguish the fire,"" ulugetenne said, adding that his assessment was that there was no danger of the vessel breaking up. but he ruled out towing it away from sri lankan waters until the fire was completely put out and experts examined the vessel for any structural weaknesses. international salvage firm smit is leading efforts to douse the flames and is being assisted by sri lanka's navy and the indian coastguard. the three-month-old ship was heading to colombo from gujarat, india.  it had previously visited qatar and dubai and was due to go to malaysia and singapore after calling at colombo. the 25-member crew, who have already been evacuated from the ship, will be questioned on monday, police said. authorities said last week they believed the fire was caused by a nitric acid leak that the crew had been aware of since may 11. ""the captain and the crew were in quarantine, but health authorities have told us that we can question them from tomorrow,"" ajith rohana, a police spokesperson, told afp. ""we have already sent samples of polluted seawater and burnt debris from the vessel for a forensic report. ""the ship's owners, x-press feeders, said the vessel's hull remained intact and there was no damage to its fuel tanks. fishermen have been banned from the 80-kilometre (50-mile) stretch of coast,

2021-05-31,Hong Kong Turns to Businesses to Fix Foundering Vaccine Push.,"we're tracking the latest on the coronavirus outbreak and the global response.  sign up here for our daily newsletter on what you need to know. when bar and nightclub owners in hong kong met with city officials this month, they expected to hear how the government planned to coax more of the largely resistant population to get vaccinated, with their businesses only allowed to open to inoculated people. instead, officials turned the tables -- asking them what they were going to do to help boost one of the slowest covid-19 vaccine takeups among global cities. ""they only asked us if we have any ideas or plans to boost the vaccination rate,"" said liu wai, who represents the industry as chairman of the federation of hong kong and kowloon ballroom and nightclub merchants.  a fifth of nightclubs have closed down in the five months of closure and the rest are only getting 10% of regular revenue after re-opening, he said, making them desperate to see immunization rise. people line up outside a community vaccination center in hong kong, on april 26. photographer: chan long hei/bloombergcarrie lam's administration is increasingly leaning on local businesses and institutions to help get people vaccinated, as her beijing-backed government struggles to convince reluctant residents in an atmosphere of mistrust following widespread anti-china protests in 2019.  major companies, restaurants, and even colleges have started offering cash payouts, extra time off, even the chance to win a $1. 4 million apartment. ""government officials haven't been able to find a way of engaging with the community to build momentum for vaccination,"" said karen grépin, an associate professor at the university of hong kong's school of public health.  ""that's where they've faltered.  but it's also really challenging for them to lead on it, from a political perspective.  it doesn't mean they should give up.  they should find ways.  but it means working through more trusted agents. ""more businesses and institutions are coming to the fore.  last week, the city's international airport announced it would give away 60,000 flight tickets to people who got vaccinated before a september deadline.  the hong kong jockey club, which runs racecourses and betting facilities, has offered up to three paid special leave days and additional insurance coverage for employees who get their shots.  even regulators are getting involved.  the hong kong monetary authority urged banks to give two days paid vaccination leave to their employees, local newspaper apple daily reported on monday.  the hkma, which declining to comment specifically on the talks, confirmed that it made the request to facilitate immunizations.  hong kong developers chinese estates holdings ltd.  and sino group's philanthropic arm ng teng fong charitable foundation are also giving out a brand-new hk$10. 8 million ($1. 4 million) apartment to residents who have been vaccinated. vaccine appointments surged to the highest in three weeks after the apartment lottery was announced, with some 17,700 people reserving slots for the biontech se shot on saturday, while another 10,500 booked appointments for chinese maker sinovac biotech ltd. the grand central residential complex, where a $1. 4 million apartment has been offered as a grand prize for the vaccinated. photographer: anthony wallace/afp/getty imageshongkong and shanghai hotels ltd. , which runs the city's historic peninsula hotel, has offered its 1,500 hong kong-based employees hk$2,000 to get inoculated, and an additional hk$2,000 if it's able to vaccinate 70% of its local workers. local colleges are also taking steps to encourage shots, with the chinese university of hong kong requiring students staying in dormitories to get vaccinated, or else pay for their own covid tests every two weeks. as many places around the world scramble for more vaccines, hong kong's government is in the unique position of having hundreds of thousands of unused doses of the mrna vaccine developed by biontech se and pfizer inc.  set to expire.  if the vaccination rate doesn't climb, the city risks being left behind as some other global hubs resume meetings and travel. the government has tried to make vaccines more convenient, even allowing businesses to schedule on-site vaccination sessions.  in mid-may, deloitte announced 170 staff were inoculated at one such session. just 13. 4% of hong kong residents have been fully inoculated despite being one of the few places in the world where covid shots are available to all adults, according to bloomberg's vaccine tracker.  that's well below other finance centers including singapore, at 28. 3%, and london, at 28. 6%. leader lam, who has long brushed off suggestions to offer residents cash or similar incentives, argued last week that her government had already done its job by buying enough vaccines and making them freely available. ""we hope that economic incentives can be provided by institutions or employers,"" she said.  ""for the government, we will focus on the policy side. ""a notice about vaccine bubbles at the entrance to a bar and restaurant in the lan kwai fong nightlife area on april 29. photographer: paul yeung/bloombergbut some business-owners and experts argue that the government's reluctance to take concrete measures -- such as relaxing mask mandates or traveler quarantine requirements of 14 to 21 days -- dilute private efforts, and in some cases contradict them. david webb, a prominent hong kong investor and corporate governance activist, mocked the airport's offer of free flights for vaccinated people on twitter last week, noting that anyone who won a ticket would still need to shell out for quarantine.  hong kong requires all inbound travelers to quarantine in hotels, even if they have homes in the city. ""get vaccinated, win a chance to pay for 2 or 3 weeks hotel quarantine when you return?"" webb wrote.  ""hardly a compelling offer from this state-owned enterprise. ""these moves to restore freedoms for vaccinated people are increasingly being undertaken worldwide.  u. s.  and south korea have both lifted outdoor mask mandates for vaccinated people, while the european union has said it will welcome vaccinated americans as tourists this summer without quarantine requirements. the hong kong government says it can't use such incentives because of the low protection rate among the population, and the risk of new variants spreading -- though south korea's vaccination rate is currently lower than the former british colony's.  on friday, city officials said they would allow quarantine exemptions for a small number of senior bankers traveling for business. senior bankers can now skip hong kong's three-week quarantine""if we can't have a vaccination rate of about 70%, i don't think we can relax substantially on traveling, on masking, on all the social distancing measures.  we'll be left behind,"" said lam ching choi, a medical doctor and member of the executive council that advises carrie lam. hong kong's complex relationship with mainland china, which wants the city to stamp out local transmission before it'll reopen the economically vital border, is also driving officials' conservative stance. like a handful of other covid havens in the asia-pacific region that have brought local cases down to zero, the city risks being left behind in its bid to keep out all infections, especially as other economies accept that covid-19 is endemic, and move on. that's frustrated people who say that despite being fully inoculated, they've still been subjected to overly harsh restrictions.  for others who haven't yet gotten their shots, the lack of easing has raised questions about why they should bother. ""you can't survive like this when there's zero business,"" said chin chun-wing, chairman of the hong kong bar and club association.  ""no one will get vaccinated just to have a drink.

""each report is assessed thoroughly.  several have provided useful leads for us to follow up on,"" the agency said. ""iras thanks those who have come forward to provide information as this complements iras' efforts to ensure that public monies are fairly and properly used to support only those who are eligible,"" it added. businesses or individuals who wish to report malpractices or potential abuses of the jss and jgi may email jssreport@iras. gov. sg or jgireport@iras. gov. sg, or visit this website or this website respectively. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-05-31,Why are authorities so silent over police report filed against SMRT Feedback by The Vigilanteh's seditious post?.,"this has been over a week after lawyer syazana yahya made her police report against facebook page smrt feedback by the vigilanteh over its now-deleted facebook post published on 21 may, authorities have yet to make any statements or release any updates regarding the matter. in the offending post that became the subject of ms syazana's report, the page expressed support for the late singaporean statesman lee kuan yew's views on being wary of placing malay-muslim singaporeans in sensitive positions such as in the air force and navy. the straits times reported the former prime minister as saying in sep 1999:if, for instance, you put in a malay officer who's very religious and who has family ties in malaysia in charge of a machine gun unit, that's a very tricky business.  we've got to know his background . . .  i'm saying these things because they are real, and if i don't think that, and i think even if today the prime minister doesn't think carefully about this, we could have a tragedy. putting a muslim singaporean ""in a sensitive position where he has to deal with israeli tech"", which ""he knows is the same tech that is used to lay siege on palestine"", said smrt feedback by the vigilanteh, would put him in a difficult predicament. ""would he then bin laden with guilt? would his responsibilities as a singaporean be overridden by his duties as a muslim?"" the page questioned. ""lee kuan yew wasn't racist.  he just didn't want our muslim countrymen to be put in a position where they have to decide between country and god.  the best position is not having to decide at all,"" smrt feedback by the vigilanteh added. in explaining why she has decided not to withdraw her police report against the page despite smrt feedback by the vigilanteh's public apology, ms syazana pointed out that many singaporeans, particularly from minority communities, were outraged by how in the cases of the nair siblings and that of workers' party member of parliament (mp) raeesah khan, the individuals who spoke up against discrimination were subjected to police investigations for offences pertaining to racism instead. ""nevertheless, many singaporeans begrudgingly accepted the decision in hopes that if the tables were turned, and a racist comment was made against minority communities instead, the state machinery will clamp down on them as they did with ms raeesah and preetipls,"" she said. ""in my view, the actions of ms raeesah and preetipls pales in comparison to that of smrt feedback, which associated singaporean muslims to an al-qaeda terrorist leader. ""so far, the police has yet to make any statement in regards to the police report filed by ms syazana. toc has also written to the police to seek a response on the progress of investigation. in comparison to this case, the police appeared to have promptly acted on a police report against sibling duo of youtube fame, preeti nair — known as preetipls — and subhas nair for the satirical rap video they made and posted online in response to a racist ""brownface"" ad by e-payments company nets around two years ago. in a statement on 30 jul 2019 — a day after the video was uploaded — police said that it was investigating the matter for ""offensive content"" in the clip. ""the police will not tolerate any offensive content that causes ill-will between races,"" they said. no action, however, was taken against those behind the e-pay ad.  nets was only given a stern reminder by the infocomm media development authority.  the attorney-general's chambers had advised that no criminal offence had been committed, according to police. mr chew was selected by creative agency havas worldwide to star in the campaign.  havas worldwide was engaged by nets for the campaign. in the e-pay ad, mediacorp actor and deejay dennis chew took on the role of four different characters, including a malay woman wearing a headscarf.  he also had artificially darkened skin to portray an indian man, an act commonly referred to as 'brownface'. the rap video by the nair siblings contained lyrics with expletives, criticising chinese singaporeans for exploiting minorities in singapore for monetary gain such as what was seen in the e-pay commercial. ""the video was in clear contravention of the penal code.  if this video were to be allowed, then similar expletive-laden, insulting, offensive videos, targeted at all communities will have to be allowed,"" said police on why it had issued the nair siblings a two-year conditional warning each on 14 august 2019. the siblings subsequently posted an unconditional apology regarding the matter.  mediacorp had also apologised for the advertisement. ms khan ""was flamed"" during the last general election campaign period for her remarks on the robertson quay and the city harvest church incident. the current sengkang grc mp, said ms syazana, had — in her social media posts that became the subject of police reports — ""sought to highlight what she perceived to be discrimination against locals/minorities compared to elite groups"". ""ms raeesah put up a sincere apology.  nevertheless, the police investigated her for offences under s 298a of the penal code and issued a ""stern warning"" against ms raeesah,"" said ms syazana. while she was ""happy"" that smrt feedback by the vigilanteh had apologised for its earlier post, ms syazana said that ""apologies have never absolved individuals of liability and this case should not be an exception"". another case in which police had swiftly acted on reports concerning seditious material is that of sociopolitical website the real singapore (trs) co-founder and former owner yang kaiheng and his then-girlfriend ai takagi, a japanese-australian woman who is now his wife. police arrested the couple on 6 feb 2015, a day after it received reports on ""an article about the thaipusam incident"" from a trs contributor, which was published by the website. the duo was charged for sedition in apr the same year for falsely suggesting that a filipino family had caused a confrontation between police and participants during the thaipusam procession on 3 feb that year. mr yang was sentenced to eight months' jail in jun 2016 after pleading guilty to six counts of sedition after seven days of trial. ms takagi had earlier pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 10 months in jail.  she began serving her term in apr 2016. similar to trs' case and prior to the arrest of the two, much about the ownership of smrt feedback is unknown.  channel news asia in its 2019 report of smrt feedback affiliate news portal, observer+ only referred to the entity as being run by an unknown entity called the ""council"". should investigation be launched upon the facebook page, the identities of the administrators surely would have to be revealed just as in the case of trs. in an earlier post, ms syazana said that the post she had filed a police report over falls under sedition, as it ""casts aspersions on a singaporean muslim's loyalty to its nation"". ""it falsely suggests that when a muslim person is in a war with a religious element, he/she will turn his/her back on singapore,"" she said. countering such an assertion, ms syazana stressed that a muslim's ""primary obligation in islam is towards his family and country"". ""however, a non-muslim reading this post (who may not understand islam) will likely believe this post to be true.  that a singaporean muslim's loyalty is questionable in times of war.  that singaporean muslims are predisposed to be traitors. ""this is a blatant attempt to promote feelings of enmity, hatred or ill-will by non-muslims against muslims.  it is surely an offence under s 298a, penal code,"" she said. under the sedition act, those found guilty of promoting feelings of ill will and hostility between different races or classes of the population of singapore may be subject, on conviction for a first offence, to a fine of up to s$5,000 or to imprisonment for a term of up to three years, or to both.  © 2006 2021 the online citizen© 2006 2021 the online

2021-05-31,Zinedine Zidane accuses president Florentino Perez of lacking respect in letter to Real Madrid fans.,"by richard martin for mailonline  published:  08:33 bst, 31 may 2021   |  updated:  11:43 bst, 31 may 2021    7view  commentszinedine zidane has fired back at real madrid less than a week after resigning from the club. the french coach left the top job at the santiago bernabeu for the second time in three years when he decided to step down last thursday, days after the club ended the season without a trophy for the first time in 11 years. he had stayed silent on social media and in the media since leaving but he has come out swinging in an open letter to fans published in newspaper as. zinedine zidane has lifted the lid on his departure from real madrid after resigning last weekzidane said real president florentino perez did not 'give me the support i needed''i'm leaving but i'm not abandoning the ship and i'm not tired of coaching,' he wrote. 'in may 2018 i left because after two and a half years of so many victories and trophies i felt the team needed a new plan to stay at the highest level.  today things are different.  'i'm leaving because i feel that the club didn't give me the support i needed, it didn't offer me the support the construct a project for the medium or long term. '  zidane departs real for the second time as one of their greatest ever coaches, winning an unprecedented three consecutive champions leagues between 2016 and 2018 plus the 2017 laliga title and two fifa club world cups. zidane led real to the laliga title last year but ended this campaign without a trophythe frenchman restored real to the greatest heights after a poor spell under rafael benitez and they were in even greater disarray after his shock resignation in may 2018, days after his side had beaten liverpool 3-1 in the champions league final in kiev. julen lopetegui was sacked in october after his sensational departure from the spain team on the eve of the 2018 world cup and successor santiago solari did not last long either, being moved on the following march. faced with another crisis, real again turned to the smiling frenchman, who got off to a slow start and was close to being booted out after a humiliating 3-0 defeat to paris saint-germain. but he turned things around and proved himself as a top man-manager after the three month break due to the coronavirus pandemic, overseeing real's surge to the laliga title by winning 10 games in a row to overhaul leaders barcelona. zidane (pictured with perez) won three consecutive champions leagues as real madrid coachhe also built up a great relationship with the players, which he felt wasn't properly appreciatedbut zidane felt he was not given the tools he needed to consolidate that success and build for the future. and he felt the hard work he had done in building a rapport with the players was not being properly appreciated.  'i understand football and know the demands of a club like real madrid, i know that when you don't win things you have to leave.  but here they have forgotten something very important, they have forgotten everything we built each day, everything i contributed to the relationship with the players, with the 150 people who work with and around the team,' he added. 'i'm a natural winner and i was here to win trophies but beyond that you have human beings, emotions and life and i got the impression that these things were not being appreciated, and people forgot that's how you maintain the dynamic of a great club.  i even felt in a certain way that i was being reproached. 'dear madridistas,for the last 20 years, ever since the first day i stepped my foot down in the city of madrid and put on the white shirt i've felt your affection.  i've always felt there was something very special between us.  i've had the great honour of being a player and coach of the most important club of all-time, but first of all i'm a madridista like the rest of you.  that's why i wanted to write this letter to you to say goodbye to you all and explain my decision to step down as coach. when in march 2019 i accepted the offer to return to real madrid after eight months of rest it was because florentino perez asked me to, of course, but it was also because you fans asked me to do so every day.  whenever i ran into a real madrid fan on the street i felt the support and desire to see me with the team again.  because i share the values of madridismo, this club owned by its members, its fans, by everyone.  i've tried to transmit this values in everything i've done, i've always tried to be an example. spending 20 years at real madrid is the most beautiful thing that has happened in my life and i owe everything exclusively to florentino perez, who bet on me in 2001, who fought for me, to make me come to the club when certain people were against it.  i say this from the bottom of my hear, i'll always be grateful to the president for that.  always. now i've decided to leave and i wanted to explain to you well my reasons. i'm leaving but i'm not abandoning the ship and i'm not tired of coaching. in may 2018 i left because after two and a half years of so many victories and trophies i felt the team needed a new plan to stay at the highest level.  today things are different. i'm leaving because i feel that the club didn't give me the support i needed, it didn't offer me the support the construct a project for the medium or long term. i understand football and know the demands of a club like real madrid, i know that when you don't win things you have to leave.  but here they have forgotten something very important, they have forgotten everything we built each day, everything i contributed to the relationship with the players, with the 150 people who work with and around the team. i'm a natural winner and i was here to win trophies but beyond that you have human beings, emotions and life and i got the impression that these things were not being appreciated, and people forgot that's how you maintain the dynamic of a great club.  i even felt in a certain way that i was being reproached. i want people to respect what everyone together achieved.  i would have liked my relationship with the club and the president in the last few months to have been a little different to that of other coaches.  i didn't ask for privileges, of course not, just for people to have better memories.  these days, the lifespan of a coach at a big club is around two years, not much more.  to last longer human relations are essential, they are more important than money, more important than reputation, more important than anything.  you have to look after them.  that's why it hurt so much when i read in the press, after one defeat, that i was going to be sacked if i didn't win the next game.  it hurt me and all my team because these messages that were intentionally leaked to the media created negative feelings with the squad, they created doubts and misunderstandings.  at least i had some marvellous lads that would stand with me until death.  when things got ugly they saved me with great victories.  because they believed in me and they knew i believed in them. of course i'm not the best coach in the world, but i'm capable of giving each one the strength and confidence they need at work, be they players, coaching staff or any employee.  i know perfectly well what a team needs.  in the roughly 20 years i've spent at real madrid i've learned that you guys, the fans, you want to win, of course.  but above all you want us, the coach, the staff, the workers and of course the footballers, to give everything.  and i can assure you that we gave 100% of ourselves for the club. i also want to use this letter to send a message to the journalists.  i've done hundreds of press conferences and unfortunately we've spoken very little about football and i know you love football too, this sport which unites us all.  however, without wanting to criticise you or give lessons i would have liked it if your questions weren't always directed towards controversy, i would have liked us to talk more about the ball and above all the players, who are and always will be the most important thing in this game.  let's not forget about football, let's look after football. dear madridistas, i'll always be one of you. ¡hala madrid!zinedine zidane

""on clinical severity, it's a little less clear because there have not been controlled studies which look at patients that you control for multiple factors, and then look at the impact of the strain on the clinical profile,"" dr soumya said at a recent webinar organised by nus' yong loo lin school of medicine. dr soumya also said anecdotal evidence seems to indicate that more young people in india had been infected and had become seriously ill. in india, more than 27 million people have been infected with covid-19 and over 325,000 have died. in singapore, the variant has surfaced in the two biggest community clusters in recent months in changi airport and tan tock seng hospital. there are three versions of b1617: b16171, b16172 and b16173. the second version is the most relevant as it has appeared to overtake b16171 in local cases as well as those reported globally.  the third version, b16173, is rare. at this point, it remains unclear if b1617 causes more serious illness or deaths even though it is more infectious and transmissible. prof teo said the best weapon remains widespread vaccination. vaccinated individuals have a reduced chance of being infected, and a much lower likelihood of developing severe symptoms, even if they are infected, he added. preliminary research in the united states carried out by the nyu grossman school of medicine and nyu langone centre showed that the pfizer-biontech and moderna vaccines should remain effective against b1617. a study by public health england also showed that the vaccines by pfizer-biontech and astrazeneca work against b16172. the study, conducted from april 5 to may 16, found that the pfizer-biontech shot was 88 per cent effective against the b16172 variant two weeks after the second dose.  two doses of the astrazeneca vaccine were 60 per cent effective. but, with an outbreak on this scale, this will not be the only new variant of the pathogen, underscoring the urgency of vaccinations to confer some sort of immunity on the global community. most countries, unfortunately, are lagging far behind in vaccinating their people. who's european director hans kluge warned on friday that the pandemic will not be over until at least 70 per cent of people are vaccinated.  he deplored the pace of roll-out in europe, saying that while it was better, it was still ""too slow"". the european centre for disease prevention and control said some 43 per cent of adults in the european union and european economic area have received at least one dose of a covid-19 vaccine as at saturday. ""time is against us,"" dr kluge warned, stressing the need to accelerate the immunisation campaign. worldwide, too, the situation is not looking good. the new york times reported that more than 1. 81 billion vaccine doses had been administered worldwide as at friday, but a stark gap remains between vaccination programmes in different countries, with some yet to report administering a single dose. global inequity in vaccine supplies and distribution persists, and the opportunity for widespread vaccination remains a privilege for advanced economies, prof teo noted. professor dale fisher, chair of the who's global outbreak alert and response network, said this means a higher chance of b1617 creeping into countries previously minimally affected by covid-19. ""these countries, such as thailand, cambodia, laos and vietnam, are more vulnerable due to the low vaccination rates, leaving them more susceptible to severe disease,"" prof fisher added. he urged wealthier nations to lend more support to the who-backed covax programme, a global project to secure and distribute vaccines to poorer countries. prof teo said that with over 3,000 mutations and counting, more virulent strains might emerge in countries where pandemic control is lacking. even in vietnam, which had a good handle on the virus but saw a spike in cases this month, the authorities have detected a new variant that is a combination of the b16172 and b117 variants, and spreads quickly by air, said vietnam's health minister nguyen thanh long on saturday. vietnam will soon publish genomic data of the newly identified variant, which replicated very quickly in the laboratory.  this could explain why so many new cases have appeared in different parts of the country in a short period of time. prof fisher said singapore seems to have managed to curtail the potentially devastating outcome of b1617 sweeping through the community because of its strong public health measures and high vaccination rates. but the country will not be totally safe until the rest of the world is something which will happen only if more is done globally to get all people vaccinated, prof fisher added. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-05-31,"Fish in a 'responsible and sustainable' manner, says NParks, after angler catches eagle ray.","singapore: the national parks board (nparks) said on sunday (may 30) that members of the public are encouraged to fish in a responsible manner and to use more sustainablepracticessuch as the catch-and-release. ""this is especially for juveniles, endangered and threatened species,"" director of nparks' national biodiversity centre dr karenne tun said in response to queries from cna. dr tun's statement follows the emergence of a widely shared video on facebook of an angler in singapore reeling in what appears to be a white-spotted eagle ray at east coast park. the ray, which can grow up to 3m wide, is classified as vulnerable under the international union for conservation of nature red list of threatened species. nparks did not comment on the video or clarify where or when the ray was caught, but said ittakes a balanced approach on recreational fishing and works withother agencies to educate the fishing community to fish only at designated sites. designated fishing sites include changi beach park and changi boardwalk, east coast park, labrador nature reserve, pasir ris park, pulau ubin, sembawang park, west coast park and woodlands waterfront park. nparks said that it has also worked with sustainable fishing group marine stewards singapore to develop an information board at bedok jetty. the board showcases the common fish species caught there, ""as well as to promote sustainable fishing practices, including catch-and-release.  the white-spotted eagle ray is included in the 'catch-and-release' list,"" said dr tun. 'no fishing' areasto protect singapore's marine life and the more than 100 species of fish that can be found in singapore's waters, certain 'no fishing' areas have been designated for fish to flourish and grow to maturity, nparks said. these include areas such as the sisters' islands marine park, sungei buloh wetland reserve, labrador nature reserve's rocky shore, chek jawa wetlands, and the waters around coney island park. offenders can be fined up to s$5,000 for fishing in 'no fishing' areas in nparks-managed parks, and up to s$50,000 for fishing in nature reserves. nparks also works with other agencies to carry out joint enforcement operations in nature reserves and reservoirs to curb illegal fishing, it said. sustainable fishingdr tun said nparks has also worked with fishing communities and engaged anglers through community initiatives to promote responsible fishing and ""best practices for recreational fishing"". members of the public who fish recreationally should also consider more sustainable methods of fishing, dr tun said. each method of fishing from the hook, rod and line to fish traps and nets, ""has their own characteristics and varies in their impact on the environment"", she explained. ""fish traps and nets tend to be more indiscriminate, and when lost in the sea, will continue to trap and kill fish and other marine life. ""nets that settle onto the seabed could also entangle corals or other bottom-dwelling organisms, and can smother them to death. ""for this reason, net fishing and the use of wire mesh traps are not allowed in areas managed by nparks,"" said dr tun. nparks also encourages catch-and-release fishing, where fish that are not going to be eaten are released back into the sea. ""responsible fishing practices will help us maintain our rich biodiversity and will the population to continue to thrive,"" said dr tun. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-05-31,"The final was lost inside Pep Guardiola’s head: Richard Buxton, Latest Football News.","pep guardiola lost the champions league final in the only way that he knows how. manchester city's manager waited an entire decade to again reach the showpiece of europe's elite club competition, just to get inside his own head once he was there. guardiola did not blow the chance to claim his third continental crown yesterday morning (singapore time); he surrendered it before the final against chelsea even began. the english premier league champions tried to spring a surprise on their west london counterparts by throwing caution to the wind with a midfield devoid of enforcement, for the first time since november's win over olympiakos in a group-stage dead rubber. instead, omitting both fernandinho and rodri from their starting line-up handed thomas tuchel's side the easiest roadmap to follow to a 1-0 victory in porto. while guardiola tinkered with a previously reliable formula one which saw city stroll to the epl title at a relative canter the blues were able to cut through their opponents at will. tuchel refused to pander to the convention that deploying two ball-winning midfielders on the biggest stage is an act of heresy. guardiola himself produced his most sparkling managerial displays with xavi hernandez and andres iniesta occupying a double pivot at barcelona. but city using no holding players whatsoever was an act that bordered on self-sabotage and allowed n'golo kante to hoover up the play as well as the man of the match award. something curious seems to happen to guardiola whenever immortality beckons in the champions league. his coaching career has become so heavily entwined with it yet, no matter how much the stars align, he still somehow manages to deviate off-course. tried-and-tested methods go out the window once the ultimate prize draws tantalisingly close.  it happened in a succession of quarter-final exits, including 310km south of the estadio do dragao last summer as lyon bypassed city's defence-heavy outfit in lisbon. packing the attack rather than his backline was guardiola's biggest blunder on this latest occasion.  he sacrificed the core principles of city's well-oiled machine to pursue a utopian vision of winning through the merits of raw creativity and reckless abandon. remarkably, he made the same mistake that had led to his crowning glory after sir alex ferguson recently lamented his failure to shackle park ji -sung to lionel messi in 2011. manchester united's grandmaster realised the error of his ways after just 10 minutes at wembley as he watched the south korea international largely chasing shadows. guardiola, too, will appreciate the gift of hindsight after trying to outsmart the game plan of an opposite number whose philosophy is heavily aligned to his own and has successfully overcome the city boss three times in the past six weeks alone. critical thinking hinders him as much as jose mourinho is by his own petulance. repeating the flaw at the same stadium that his eternal nemesis forged one of the champions league's most unlikely winners is an irony which will not be lost on many. guardiola's standing as the finest coach of his generation is indisputable.  anyone with 26 major honours in 12 seasons cannot be considered anything else. unless he arrests the second-guessing, however, the champions league will continue to elude both himself and the etihad stadium's all-star cast for years to come. man city: ederson, walker, stones, dias, zinchenko, guendogan, silva (fernandinho 64), foden, mahrez, de bruyne (jesus 60), sterling (aguero 77)chelsea: mendy, azpilicueta, silva (christensen 39), ruediger, james, kante, jorginho, chilwell, havertz, mount (kovacic 80), werner (pulisic 66)on christmas eve last year, thomas tuchel was sacked as paris saint-germain coach. barely six months later, the german has the last laugh as he reached the pinnacle of european club football with chelsea by defeating pep guardiola's manchester city 1-0 in the final. it was tuchel's third win over guardiola's english premier league champions in six weeks, following last month's 1-0 fa cup semi-final victory and the 2-1 away epl win at the etihad earlier this month. kai havertz struck shortly before half-time, picking up mason mount's through-ball and rounding city goalkeeper ederson for the winner, as city looked like a pale shadow of themselves. former arsenal manager arsene wenger said tuchel had pipped guardiola in the tactical battle. ""i must say that what tuchel did well is that he played mount and havertz more inside defensively,"" the frenchman told bein sports.  ""so manchester city could never find a way through the middle and had to go wide where chelsea were quite strong tonight. ""manchester city had a big tactical problem they could not sort out. ""they're not balanced, they did not find a way to play incisive football and chelsea stopped them very well. ""wenger also praised chelsea midfielder n'golo kante, who had also put in title-winning performances with the 2015/16 epl-winning leicester city side and the 2018 world cup winners france. former chelsea midfielder joe cole, speaking on bt sport, is another admirer of kante. ""i played (at chelsea) with (french international) claude makelele, who i thought was the best until i saw this kid.  he's got makelele plus extras,"" he added. ""(city's ilkay) guendogan, (bernardo) silva and (phil) foden couldn't read it, kante was just on it. ""city fans, though, would be scratching their heads wondering why guardiola started without either of his holding midfielders fernandinho and rodri, something he had rarely done. instead, he deployed guendogan just in front of the back four, a move that backfired and led to criticism of his over-tinkering. ""i think that will be levelled at him because he changed the way he had played all season.  he has always had rodri or fernandinho in there but he changed it,"" said former england defender rio ferdinand. ""we know tactically he tinkers, he might have seen a weakness in there, but thomas tuchel nullified any threat. ""we saw riyad mahrez and raheem sterling played really wide, they've not really done that this season and maybe that is something city did wrong,"" he added. guardiola insisted that his selections had been designed to overcome the blues. ""i picked the best selection to win the game and the players know it,"" he said.  ""i think guendogan played good, but we missed a little bit to break the lines in the first half.  the second half was much better. ""while guardiola rues his mistake , tuchel is already eyeing an extension of his 18-month contract and his rivalry with the catalan. when asked about meeting chelsea owner roman abramovich, tuchel said: ""i am looking forward to this.  i can assure him that i will stay hungry.  that i want the next title.

2021-05-31,Malaysia struggling to contain sharp rise in Covid cases.,"country to enter near-total lockdown after record daily cases for five consecutive dayslast modified on mon 31 may 2021 09. 34 bstmalaysia's intensive care units are struggling to cope with a sharp rises in covid cases, the health director general has warned, as the country prepares to enter a near total lockdown from tuesday. malaysia managed to avoid the worst of the pandemic last year, but has struggled to contain a recent outbreak that has been driven by more infectious variants of the virus, and exacerbated by gatherings ahead of eid al-fitr. this month alone, more than 1,200 deaths have been recorded, compared with 471 during the whole of 2020.  last week, malaysia reported record daily cases for five consecutive days and announced its highest daily rise since the start of the pandemic on saturday, when 9,020 new infections were reported. the health director general, noor hisham abdullah, said that although extra icu beds had been created, some facilities had already reached full capacity.  ""this has led to patients being treated in normal wards,"" he said in a statement on facebook on sunday.  the surge in cases over the weekend meant that the number of patients with severe illness was expected to rise further, he added. additional containers have also been sent to hospital morgues, which are struggling to cope with the rise in deaths. under new lockdown rules, which will be introduced on tuesday, only two people from each household will be allowed to go out to buy essentials or seek medical treatment within 10km of their home.  sports activities such as jogging that do not involve physical contact are permitted but only between 7am and 8pm.  schools and shopping malls will be shut. much of the manufacturing sector will be allowed to continue operating with a reduced workforce.  this includes companies producing rubber gloves, electronics, oil and gas, chemical products and food and beverages. malaysia is among several south-east asian countries, including thailand and singapore, that managed to keep the virus under control last year, but which have reported sudden increases in cases.  the region is facing new, more infectious variants but is struggling to roll out vaccination campaigns quickly. the malaysian government has said it will to set up five more mass vaccination centres in the capital, kuala lumpur, and that private doctors will join immunisation efforts to boost capacity.  so far, almost 6% of the country's 32 million population have received at least one vaccine dose.  the government reached 107,000 doses a day last week and aims to increase daily vaccinations to 150,000 doses. human rights groups have warned that malaysia's health campaigns are likely to be hindered by its hostile treatment of migrants and refugees.  the immigration department announced it will carry out raids and surprise checks throughout the two-week lockdown. many migrants are fearful of coming forward to access medical care, even though the government has announced that all people will qualify for vaccines, regardless of their immigration status, said john quinley, senior human rights specialist for the ngo fortify rights.  ""those are well-founded fears – of people being sent back to countries of origin that have ongoing war and persecution, or of just not being able to economically provide for your family because you've been put in detention,"" he said. last year, malaysia arrested thousands of migrants and held them in overcrowded detention centres, which subsequently experienced outbreaks of the virus.  it is feared that additional arrests will only lead to further clusters inside cramped facilities.

2021-05-31,COVID vaccination guidelines eased for pregnant women.,"singapore — covid-19 vaccination guidelines in singapore have been eased for pregnant women, breastfeeding women, cancer patients currently receiving treatment, and persons who have previously suffered severe skin allergy reactions to medications.  the expert committee on covid-19 vaccination (ec19v) has been monitoring evidence and developments around the world and has revised its guidelines accordingly, the multi-ministry taskforce (mtf) on the pandemic said at a virtual press briefing on monday (31 may). there was no evidence to suggest that the pfizer-biontech or moderna covid-19 vaccines may cause harm to pregnant women or their babies, the mtf stated. however, the committee noted that the amount of data collected on the population segment was still much smaller compared to data on the general population. it advised pregnant women to discuss the risks and benefits with their doctors to make an informed decision on the vaccination.  pregnant women will be able to register and book a vaccination appointment from 4 june, if they are part of the population group eligible for vaccination. similarly, the two vaccines have been deemed to be safe for breastfeeding women and there is no need to stop breastfeeding while receiving the jabs, the ec19v said.  cancer patients on active cancer treatment remain at an increased risk of complications from covid-19 but there was no evidence of any safety signals or increased rates of adverse events from mrna-based covid-19 vaccines, noted the authorities. director of medical services kenneth mak noted that moh had previously exercised ""considerable caution"" and advised that these patients complete their treatment before getting vaccinated.  ""at this time, we prefer for these patients to be vaccinated in a hospital setting where they can be better monitored for their health status.  and we will review later whether these conditions can be revised. ""persons with severe cutaneous adverse reactions (scar), or sever skin allergy reactions to medications, can also receive both vaccines, even though they were previously not recommended to do so.  scar includes stevens-johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, and drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome. ""these are very severe reactions that occur as a result of taking various types of medications,"" explained prof mak.

2021-05-31,Intel reiterates chip supply shortages could last several years.,"intel corp's ceo said on monday it could take several years for a global shortage of semiconductors to be resolved, a problem that has shuttered some auto production lines and is also being felt in other areas, including consumer electronics. taipei:     intel corp's ceo said on monday it could take several years for a global shortage of semiconductors to be resolved, a problem that has shuttered some auto production lines and is also being felt in other areas, including consumer electronics. pat gelsinger told a virtual session of the computex trade show in taipei that the work-and-study-from-home trend during the covid-19 pandemic had led to a ""cycle of explosive growth in semiconductors"" that has placed huge strain on global supply chains. ""but while the industry has taken steps to address near term constraints it could still take a couple of years for the ecosystem to address shortages of foundry capacity, substrates and components. ""gelsinger had told the washington post in an interview in mid-april the shortage was going to take ""a couple of years"" to abate, and that it planned to start producing chips within six to nine months to address shortages at u. s.  car plants. intel announced a us$20 billion plan in march to expand its advanced chip manufacturing capacity, building two factories in arizona and opening its plants to outside customers.

2021-05-31,Horses starve to death as COVID-19 pandemic hits Bangladesh tourism.,"cox's bazar, bangladesh: more than 20 horses have died of starvation in just one month at bangladesh's most popular resort district, the animals' owners said on sunday (may 30), as the country's tourism industry reels from the pandemic's economic fallout. the south asian nation of 168 million people is battling a fresh wave of coronavirus infections that has stretched its healthcare system and triggered a nationwide lockdown. the horses' owners said they were struggling to afford fodder for their animals, which are used for tourist rides at cox's bazar beach one of the world's longest. ""once coronavirus hit, tourist numbers . . .  sharply dropped to a trickle,"" farida begum, spokesperson of the cox's bazar horse owners association, told afp. ""we are struggling to make ends meet.  how can we feed the horses?""tourists had briefly returned to the district from december to february when infections slowed, but visits dried up under the fresh lockdown imposed from apr 14. at least 21 horses out of up to 90 used for tourists at the beach died over the past month while others were emaciated, begum said. during last year's lockdown, 41 horses including eight of begum's own died, she added. some owners have set their horses free, hoping they can survive by eating grass or foraging for food. the horse owners say they have been struggling to feed their own families, with many taking out loans from microlenders just to make ends meet. ""officials from the microlender come to my home every week and badger me to pay back the loan in instalments.  but unless the tourists start arriving in cox's bazar, i can't pay back the money,"" begum said, adding that she had borrowed 100,000 taka (us$1,200). dozens of horse handlers usually hired by the owners to help tourists with the rides have switched to driving rickshaws or construction work. ""no tourists means no income""the resort town usually attracts more than 2 million mostly domestic tourists every year. but under the nationwide lockdown, offices and markets are shut and public transport has been halted. horse owner sarwar azam told afp that one of his animals died last week and the second was also going hungry. the head of a local horse owners' organisation, nishan ahsan whose four animals died during last year's lockdown said his members had received limited aid from the government. ""during the peak tourism time, a horse can earn up to 2,000 taka (us$23) a day.  we would set aside a slice of that income for the horses' food, which is expensive,"" ahsan told afp. ""but no tourists means no income for us. ""the government administrator for cox's bazar, sumaiya akter, said she had only heard of four to five horses dying in the past eight months. she added that the government had given the owners 146 sacks of husks and 20 cans of molasses since may 9. bangladesh has recorded nearly 800,000 coronavirus infections and more than 12,300 deaths since the start of the pandemic, but experts say the actual numbers are likely to be much higher. just over 6 per cent of the population has received the first vaccine dose, while the government has said it is running out of jabs as it tries to combat the latest devastating virus wave. downloadour appor subscribe to our telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:https://cna. asia/telegramit looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

""naomi has the opportunity to use her status to address problems and to initiate things,"" osaka's belgian coach wim fissette told german magazine der spiegel. ""in the united states, the subject is very topical at the moment, as athletes want more freedom in dealing with the press. ""so that they are simply not threatened right away with punishment if they don't feel well for a day. ""on sunday (may 30) , officials at roland garros threatened osaka, the world no.  2, with disqualification if she persists in boycotting media press conferences, which she claims are detrimental to her mental health. the 23-year-old was fined us$15,000 (s$19,900) for refusing to attend a press conference after her opening 6-4, 7-6 (7-4) victory over romanian world no.  63 patricia maria tig. following her win, osaka agreed only to a cursory on-court tv interview. osaka has likened traditional post-match press conferences to ""kicking people when they're down"", but french tennis federation president gilles moretton has described her vow of silence as ""a phenomenal error"". however, following her win over tig, osaka stood firm by tweeting: ""anger is a lack of understanding.  change makes people uncomfortable. ""in the spiegel interview, fissette also insisted osaka ""knows it's important to talk to the press"" and is not boycotting the media ""for herself alone"", but is ""concerned with fundamental issues she wants to bring about change"". earlier this year, the japanese superstar won the fourth grand slam title of her career at the australian open, but has never got past the third round of the french open. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-05-31,Malaysia should consider getting China’s help on Covid-19 crisis.,"
                    sunday, 30 may 2021
                li (left) meeting with muhyiddin via video link recently.  — xinhuatwo fridays ago, the prime ministers of malaysia and china held a meeting via video link, discussing bilateral issues ranging from investment, digital economy, manufacturing, agriculture to marine infrastructure and cooperation in combating covid-19 pandemic. according to official bernama's report, malaysia and china are exploring new areas of to strengthen bilateral collaboration, and these include aspects of covid-19 vaccine production through the ""fill and finish"" method here and collaboration in electronic commerce, high technology and digital economy. ""the chinese government has given a very positive response for these proposed collaborations. . .  both of us agreed that malaysia-china bilateral ties have remained close and continued to expand positively in the face of bitter challenges arising from the covid-19 pandemic, "" said tan sri muhyiddin jassin on his facebook. on covid-19, muhyiddin said both leaders saw the need for closer and more proactive cooperation to overcome the pandemic and drive the economic recovery process, including continued collaboration in vaccine supply and food security. and according to china's official news agency xinhua, chinese premier li keqiang said beijing supports malaysia in improving its vaccine production capacity and epidemic prevention experts of the two countries to enhance exchanges and experience sharing. li also said china hopes malaysia will ensure that ""chinese citizens in malaysia are vaccinated soon"" and in reply, muhyiddin said putrajaya will provide convenience for chinese citizens to get inoculated. malaysia is the first country to sign an intergovernmental cooperation agreement on covid-19 vaccines and make a reciprocal arrangement for vaccination with china. for muhyiddin, this may 21 meeting was important to him as it was his first meeting with a top leader from china – the region's largest economy – since he became prime minister in march last year. in fact, this meeting was originally scheduled to be held in china earlier.  but muhyiddin's official visit to beijing had to be postponed in view of the emergency rule and political instability in malaysia, according to a source. however, for malaysians following the news, it was the topic on bilateral cooperation in vaccination and combating covid-19 that had caught their attention. all else does not matter to malaysians now, as their key focus is on the covid-19 crisis, which is getting worse despite unfettered powers enjoyed by the government under the emergency rule that began on jan 11 and not expected to end soon. for the past weeks, malaysians have witnessed local daily new covid-19 cases surpassing the 7,000 mark and death numbers hitting record highs in recent weeks. as of last wednesday, covid-19 cases in malaysia totalled 533,367 while death toll was at 2,432. according to a cnbc report last wednesday, malaysia's daily covid-19 infections per million people – on a seven-day rolling basis – have exceeded that of india since last sunday. malaysia reported on tuesday 205. 1 cases per million people on a seven-day rolling basis, higher than india's 150. 4 cases, according to cnbc.  malaysia has 32. 7 million people, much fewer than india's 1. 4 billion. the cnbc data indicate that malaysia is now the worst covid-hit country in the world.  this is ironical given that in the first half of last year, the world health organisation described malaysia's covid-19 response as ""strong and robust"". chinese experts who were in malaysia then to share their experience in combating epidemic in wuhan, the first area in the world to be hit by the covid-19 epidemic, had also given malaysia the thumbs up. but on top of all this, malaysia – like other countries – is also infected by the indian covid variants that spread and kill more ferociously.  hence, its battleground is filled with more types of enemies. what does not help is the country's slow progress in mass inoculation.  this has sparked discontent and raised anxiety – not only among locals, but also foreigners and their families residing in malaysia. as of may 26, only 2. 583 million vaccine doses had been administered in malaysia.  this figure was behind that of cambodia, singapore, thailand, myanmar, the philippines and indonesia, according to data compiled by sin chew daily. beijing is now worried about its nationals here.  this can be seen from a china daily report that wrote: ""premier li hopes malaysia guarantees early inoculation of chinese citizens in malaysia. ""for china's citizens, they are blessed with a government that cares about their safety – even for those overseas.  indeed, the chinese embassy has sent out preventive anti-covid medicine to its countrymen in malaysia. it is not clear whether china will be allowed to send its experts here to inoculate its own people, like what china is doing in thailand now. according an ap report, chinese citizens living in thailand have been vaccinated from may 20 as part of china's global campaign to inoculate its people abroad.  about150,000 chinese citizens live in thailand. from the reports of bernama, xinhua and china daily, it is clear that beijing is keen to lend a hand to putrajaya on the continuous supply of vaccines and speeding up the current inoculation programme.  when the covid-19 first hit malaysia last year, beijing sent personal protective equipment (ppe) and its experts to help putrajaya contain the virus. in fact, beijing has a policy of using its vaccines to do global public good.  on may 21, president xi jinping announced china would provide an additional us$3bil (about rm13bil) in international aid over the next three years to support covid-19 response and economic recovery in developing countries. making these remarks during a speech at the global health summit via video link from beijing, xi said china has already supplied 300 million doses of covid-19 vaccines to the world and will provide more. he noted that china has given us$2bil in assistance to combat covid-19 in developing countries, and have sent medical supplies to 150 countries, provided 280 billion masks and 4. 0 billion testing kits to the world.  in the case of malaysia, it is in the interest of beijing to see putrajaya getting back to normalcy fast.  china has been the largest trading partner of malaysia for the last 12 consecutive years, and its investments in this asean country are sizeable and continue to rise. as getting malaysia out off the current crisis will be good for putrajaya and beijing, malaysia should respond to any help extended by china in inoculation and overcoming the health crisis. a reliable supply of ample vaccines and an effective strategy to speed up the vaccination rate is important. from news flow, china has the capacity to make billion of vaccines this year and is carrying out a mass immunisation exercise efficiently. while china's sinopharm vaccine has just been listed by the who as ""safe and effective"" for global use, sinovac's vaccine is awaiting who recognition. in fact, with malaysia's current medical standard and reasonably good health infrastructure, many believe that it is capable of bringing forward its year-end target to have 80% of its 32. 7 million people vaccinated, if the right policies and strategies are employed. if bangkok could set target to inoculate 70% of its 66 million population to by september to achieve herb immunity, there is no reason why malaysia – more developed and richer – cannot work faster. the same argument goes for indonesia, with 270 million people.  according to a nikkei report last week, indonesia has now received 83. 9 million doses of vaccines from sinovac. with warnings from health director-general tan sri dr noor hisham abdullah that covid-19 cases are expected to rise further, economist lee heng guie says malaysia has to reset its ""virus war"" strategy and vaccination must be accelerated. ""there is nothing wrong to rectify our recourse and learn from countries that have done well (china, new zealand and singapore) in the aspects of testing and tracing, communication, gaining pubic trust, influencing public behaviour etc, "" says lee, executive director of socio-economic research centre. ""compliance to the covid-19 is everyone's collective responsibility.  all political leaders must demonstrate good leadership.  the sop must be strictly enforced, regardless of status.  the rules and guidelines need to be clear, consistent and sensible, "" he adds in an email. the economist believes practising transparency can instil public trust on the government's vaccination programme. ""it is vital to provide data on the supply of vaccines by type; the outstanding stocks and the incoming supply on a regular basis, "" he opines. as half a million residents in malaysia are still infected and many lives are at stake, putrajaya needs to respond correctly with urgency.  it must display strong political will to save the nation and restore normal life.

video link, discussing bilateral issues ranging from investment, digital economy, manufacturing, agriculture to marine infrastructure and cooperation in combating covid-19 pandemic.', 'according to official bernama\'s report, malaysia and china are exploring new areas of to strengthen bilateral collaboration, and these include aspects of covid-19 vaccine production through the ""fill and finish"" method here and collaboration in electronic commerce, high technology and digital economy.', '""the chinese government has given a very positive response for these proposed collaborations.', '.', '.', 'both of us agreed that malaysia-china bilateral ties have remained close and continued to expand positively in the face of bitter challenges arising from the covid-19 pandemic, "" said tan sri muhyiddin jassin on his facebook.', 'on covid-19, muhyiddin said both leaders saw the need for closer and more proactive cooperation to overcome the pandemic and drive the economic recovery process, including continued collaboration in vaccine supply and food security.', ""and according to china's official news agency xinhua, chinese premier li keqiang said beijing supports malaysia in improving its vaccine production capacity and epidemic prevention experts of the two countries to enhance exchanges and experience sharing."", 'li also said china hopes malaysia will ensure that ""chinese citizens in malaysia are vaccinated soon"" and in reply, muhyiddin said putrajaya will provide convenience for chinese citizens to get inoculated.', 'malaysia is the first country to sign an intergovernmental cooperation agreement on covid-19 vaccines and make a reciprocal arrangement for vaccination with china.', ""for muhyiddin, this may 21 meeting was important to him as it was his first meeting with a top leader from china – the region's largest economy – since he became prime minister in march last year."", 'in fact, this meeting was originally scheduled to be held in china earlier.', ""but muhyiddin's official visit to beijing had to be postponed in view of the emergency rule and political instability in malaysia, according to a source."", 'however, for malaysians following the news, it was the topic on bilateral cooperation in vaccination and combating covid-19 that had caught their attention.', 'all else does not matter to malaysians now, as their key focus is on the covid-19 crisis, which is getting worse despite unfettered powers enjoyed by the government under the emergency rule that began on jan 11 and not expected to end soon.', 'for the past weeks, malaysians have witnessed local daily new covid-19 cases surpassing the 7,000 mark and death numbers hitting record highs in recent weeks.', ""as of last wednesday, covid-19 cases in malaysia totalled 533,367 while death toll was at 2,432. according to a cnbc report last wednesday, malaysia's daily covid-19 infections per million people – on a seven-day rolling basis – have exceeded that of india

million people, much fewer than india's 1."", '4 billion.', 'the cnbc data indicate that malaysia is now the worst covid-hit country in the world.', 'this is ironical given that in the first half of last year, the world health organisation described malaysia\'s covid-19 response as ""strong and robust"".', 'chinese experts who were in malaysia then to share their experience in combating epidemic in wuhan, the first area in the world to be hit by the covid-19 epidemic, had also given malaysia the thumbs up.', 'but on top of all this, malaysia – like other countries – is also infected by the indian covid variants that spread and kill more ferociously.', 'hence, its battleground is filled with more types of enemies.', ""what does not help is the country's slow progress in mass inoculation."", 'this has sparked discontent and raised anxiety – not only among locals, but also foreigners and their families residing in malaysia.', 'as of may 26, only 2.', '583 million vaccine doses had been administered in malaysia.', 'this figure was behind that of cambodia, singapore, thailand, myanmar, the philippines and indonesia, according to data compiled by sin chew daily.',

'""for china\'s citizens, they are blessed with a government that cares about their safety – even for those overseas.', 'indeed, the chinese embassy has sent out preventive anti-covid medicine to its countrymen in malaysia.', 'it is not clear whether china will be allowed to send its experts here to inoculate its own people, like what china is doing in thailand now.', ""according an ap report, chinese citizens living in thailand have been vaccinated from may 20 as part of china's global campaign to inoculate its people abroad."", 'about150,000 chinese citizens live in thailand.', 'from the reports of bernama, xinhua and china daily, it is clear that beijing is keen to lend a hand to putrajaya on the continuous supply of vaccines and speeding up the current inoculation programme.', 'when the covid-19 first hit malaysia last year, beijing sent personal protective equipment (ppe) and its experts to help putrajaya contain the virus.', 'in fact, beijing has a policy of using its vaccines to do global public good.', 'on may 21, president xi jinping announced china would provide an additional us$3bil (about rm13bil) in international aid over the next three years to support covid-19 response and economic recovery in developing countries.', 'making these remarks during a speech at the global health summit via video link from beijing, xi said china has already supplied 300 million doses of covid-19 vaccines to the world and will provide more.', 'he noted that china has given us$2bil in assistance to combat covid-19 in developing countries, and have sent medical supplies to 150 countries, provided 280 billion masks and 4.', '0 billion testing kits to the world.', 'in the case of malaysia, it is in the interest of beijing to see putrajaya getting back to normalcy fast.', 'china has been the largest trading partner of malaysia for the last 12 consecutive years, and its investments in this asean country are sizeable and continue to rise.', 'as getting malaysia out off the current crisis will be good for putrajaya and beijing, malaysia should respond to any help extended by china in inoculation and overcoming the health crisis.', 'a reliable supply of ample vaccines and an effective strategy to speed up the vaccination rate is important.', 'from news flow, china has the capacity to make billion of vaccines this year and is carrying out a mass immunisation exercise efficiently.', 'while china\'s sinopharm vaccine has just been listed by the who as ""safe and effective"" for global use, sinovac\'s vaccine is awaiting who recognition.', ""in fact, with malaysia's current medical standard and reasonably good health infrastructure, many believe that it is capable of bringing forward its year-end target to have 80% of its 32."", '7 million people vaccinated, if the right policies and strategies are employed.', 'if bangkok could set target to inoculate 70% of its 66 million population to by september to achieve herb immunity, there is no reason why malaysia – more developed and richer – cannot work faster.', 'the same argument goes for indonesia, with 270 million people.', 'according to a nikkei report last week, indonesia has now received 83.', '9 million doses of vaccines from sinovac.', 'with warnings from health director-general tan sri dr noor hisham abdullah that covid-19 cases are expected to rise further, economist lee heng guie

2021-05-31,Vietnam discovers new hybrid virus variant.,"people in hanoi wait to be tested for covid-19 at a makeshift testing centre near bach mai hospital/afpvietnam has discovered a new covid-19 variant which spreads quickly by air and is a combination of the indian and british strains, health officials confirmed saturday. the country is struggling to deal with fresh outbreaks across more than half of its territory, including industrial zones and big cities such as hanoi and ho chi minh city. more than 6,800 cases including 47 deaths have been reported in vietnam, with the lion's share occurring since april. ""we have discovered a new hybrid variant from the indian and the uk strains,"" health minister nguyen thanh long told a national meeting on the pandemic saturday, according to state media. ""the characteristic of this strain is that it spreads quickly in the air.  the concentration of virus in the throat fluid increases rapidly and spreads very strongly to the surrounding environment. ""he did not specify the number of cases recorded with this new variant but said vietnam will soon announce the discovery in the world's map of genetic strains. vietnam's central institute of hygiene and epidemiology said in a statement saturday that its scientists had detected gene mutations in four out of 32 patient samples through gene sequencing. there were seven known coronavirus variants in vietnam before long's announcement, according to the ministry of health. the communist country has previously received widespread applause for its aggressive pandemic response, with mass quarantines and strict contact tracing helping keep infection rates relatively low. the new round of infections has made the public and government fearful and authorities have quickly moved to place strict limits on movement and business activity. cafes, restaurants, hair salons and massage parlours as well as tourism and religious spots have been ordered to close in various areas of the country. vietnam — a country of 97 million people — has vaccinated a little over a million citizens. it is now ramping up its jab rollout and hopes to achieve herd immunity by the end of the year, according to the health minister. authorities have called on people and businesses to donate money to help procure vaccines, while embassies and international organisations have been contacted for assistance, state media reported. the country presently has close to two million doses of astrazeneca's vaccine remaining, but said it is buying more than 30 million doses of the pfizer shot. it is also in talks with russia to produce sputnik v, according to state media, and is working on a home-grown vaccine. in nearby thailand, the government on saturday took exception to media reports in britain that labelled a new strain causing concern there as the ""thai variant"". the strain was first detected in thailand in a 33-year-old egyptian traveller, uk health authorities said, but 109 cases have since been found in britain. ""principally speaking, it should not be called the thai variant because the infected person is from overseas,"" said opas kankawinpong, head of thailand's disease control department. — afp © 2006

""pregnant women will be able to register and book a vaccination appointment from june 4 onwards if they are part of the population group eligible for vaccination. but mtf added that they should discuss the risks and benefits with their doctors to make an informed decision on the vaccination.

2021-05-31,Beijing's HK office slams intimidation of judge in tycoon Jimmy Lai's case.,"
                    monday, 31 may 2021
                on friday, judge amanda woodcock sentenced jimmy lai to 14 months in jail.  aphong kong (reuters): beijing's office that oversees matters in hong kong has warned of threats made to a judge who sentenced media tycoon jimmy lai and other democracy activists for their roles in an unauthorised assembly on oct 1,2019. a representative for the hong kong and macau affairs office (hkmao) said the presiding judge had received threatening phone calls, which the office said would not be tolerated. ""this is a serious threat to the personal safety of judges, a flagrant challenge to the judicial system in hong kong and a gross violation of the rule of law and order in hong kong,"" xinhua quoted a statement by hkmao as saying late on sunday (may 30). the statement followed one by hong kong's department of justice late on friday that said a judge had been intimidated, without providing details. on friday, judge sentenced lai, an ardent critic of beijing, to 14 months in jail, and nine others to up to 18 months for their roles in the rally. hong kong arrested more than 10,000 people over anti-government protests in 2019, and some of those cases are now making their way through the court system. the unrest led beijing to impose a contentious national security law on its freest city in june 2020, and more than 100 people have been arrested under the law so far, including lai. the law punishes what beijing broadly defines as secession, sedition, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in jail. forty-seven democracy activists charged with conspiracy to commit subversion are set to appear in court on monday, in a case that has drawn criticism from western governments and international rights groups. hong kong returned to chinese rule in 1997 with a guarantee of a high degree of autonomy until 2047.  critics say authorities are chipping away at those freedoms, an assertion officials in hong kong and beijing reject.

2021-05-31,"Singapore-based worker known as 'brother yum cha' goes viral in China, Singapore News.","it is 3pm, and the perfect time for a spot of tea.  or in the words of 54-year-old gurdip singh, ""oi, it's time to yum cha!"" yum cha directly translates to drinking tea in cantonese. the singapore-based worker who maintains and repairs ships for a living has become somewhat of a viral sensation in china recently for speaking fluent cantonese. but it's not just his command of the language as a non-chinese in the short 15-second video clip that had people paying attention.  the passion in which he extolls viewers to take a break from work is palpable. armed with a packet of tea, he bellows at the camera: ""have some tea first, what are you working for?""""no use working so hard, your boss won't love you for it.  have some tea first, it's three-something!"" he adds, using a smattering of expletives for emphasis. the video has spawned memes and copycat videos on chinese video-sharing platform bilibili, where the most popular clip has garnered more than three million views within a month. most recently, singh showed off his cantonese-speaking prowess in a video interview conducted with local chinese broadsheet lianhe zaobao.  he explained that he'd picked up the dialect while growing up in kuantan, malaysia, where his neighbours and friends were all chinese. the polyglot is able to speak some mandarin as well.  he is quick to state however, that his command of the language is ""not good"".  ""but my cantonese is excellent, i'm not bluffing you, it's really good,"" joked singh. the ship repairman told zaobao that he had been living in singapore since he was 16, moving here to find work.  he had also spent several years working in russia before returning to singapore. singh expressed surprise at the popularity of the video.  he told zaobao that the clip was recorded in march last year ""pre-covid"", but only went viral earlier this month. it is not clear how the clip found itself onto the video-sharing platform and on social media, but he only realised people were watching when some fans came to see him at his office just last week. ""they brought a packet of tea for me, and told me that i'm famous in china,"" said singh. one reason posited by netizens for the clip's virality in china is how it resonates with a generation of regular employees, especially migrant workers. said one netizen in hong kong: ""it speaks to the hearts of all salaried workers. ""with the recent media attention in china on the ""toxic 996 work culture"" as well as other societal pressures, it is evident that the video has struck a chord. wrote one commenter: ""those who don't get the video are not employees who have to do ot (overtime) and work hard.  those who do will feel that this foreign uncle actually cares about us. ""in the words of another netizen: ""i feel unexpectedly touched.  i don't even care for myself as much as this stranger. ""with his newfound fame, singh has received offers of sponsorships and commercial partnerships, and has also been invited to set up a channel on the chinese video platform. but before being known as ""brother yum cha"", singh said he used to have another nickname in singapore — ""elvis"". ""with my sideburns and style, people say i look like elvis presley,"" said singh, who often dresses like the iconic singer in a fitted long-sleeved shirt and leather boots whenever he is out shopping. ""a foreigner at changi airport called out 'elvis' when he saw me and even requested for a selfie,"" said singh proudly. singh added in the interview that he enjoyed his holiday to hong kong with his ex-wife and children back in 2007, where he expectedly amazed locals with his cantonese. ""they were surprised and asked how long i'd been living in hong kong,"" said singh. he hopes to have the opportunity to travel to china again in the future, and hollered for recommendations on where he should visit to ""see pretty things"", adding, ""pretty girls, also can"". candicecai@asiaone.

2021-05-31,"S$32 million in jobs scheme payouts denied to 1,300 employers for March: IRAS.","singapore: the inland revenue authority of singapore (iras) on monday (may 31) said that it has denied s$32 million in jobs support scheme (jss) and jobs growth incentive (jgi) payouts to 1,300 employers for march. ten cases of suspected jss abuses have also been referred to the police for investigation, iras said in a media release. about s$16 million in payouts was denied for each scheme, with 500 employers affected under the jss and 800 affected under the jgi. overall, iras has withheld s$85 million from 2,600 employers for further checks for march payouts under the jss and jgi.  reviews have been concluded for more than 800 jss payouts and close to 1,100 jgi payouts for the tranche. affected employers will have to submit supporting documents to iras to substantiate their eligibility for the schemes. this is ""part of iras' anti-gaming efforts to ensure that jss and jgi payouts are fairly and correctly disbursed"", the authority said. ""these 2,600 employers make up about 2 per cent of all qualifying employers for the jss and jgi payouts,"" iras said. ""employers will receive their jss and jgi payouts once iras has verified the authenticity and accuracy of the information submitted. ""their payouts would be adjusted or denied if issues are found during the review. ""s$52 million of the withheld payouts fall under the jss while the remaining s$33 million are under the jgi. the jss was introduced as part of the unity budget in february 2020 to provide wage support for employers to retain their local employees amid the covid-19 crisis.  all active employers, except for local and foreign government organisations and representative offices are eligible for the jss. the jgi aids employers in expanding local hiring ""so as to create good and long-term jobs for locals"", iras said on its website.  it is available from september 2020 to september 2021. about s$44 million in jss payouts has been denied since the scheme was implemented. suspected abusesin the process of reviewing the jss and jgi payouts, iras detected a variety of suspected abuses. ""examples include employers making central provident fund (cpf) contributions for non-genuine employees, inflating cpf contributions for employees without actual wage increases and maintaining cpf contributions for employees on wage cuts,"" it said. ""iras has adjusted the payments for employers who readily corrected their erroneous employees' cpf contributions.  some employers had chosen not to respond to iras' requests for clarifications, thus forgoing their payouts. ""a small group of employers had provided what appeared to be fabricated documents in an attempt to substantiate their eligibility for the scheme. ""iras has referred 10 cases to the police for investigation. ""egregious cases of suspected abuse would be referred to the police for further investigations,"" the authority said. police are currently looking into the 10 referred cases which all come under the jss. ""iras has a robust anti-gaming framework that harnesses data analytics and risk profiling to identify risks and prevent abuse,"" the authority said. ""a dedicated team has also been established to review the accuracy of cpf amounts for genuine employees based on actual wages paid. ""iras will continue to review employers' eligibility for subsequent jss and jgi payouts. ""iras added that it has received about 500 reports from whistleblowers on suspected jss and jgi abuses by employers. employers who abuse these schemes may be liable for the offence of cheating, and may face up to 10 years in prison and a fine. downloadour appor subscribe to our telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:https://cna. asia/telegramit looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-05-31,Beijing's Hong Kong office slams intimidation of judge in tycoon Jimmy Lai's case.,"hong kong (reuters) beijing's office that oversees matters in hong kong has warned of threats made to a judge who sentenced media tycoon jimmy lai and other democracy activists for their roles in an unauthorised assembly on oct.  1, 2019. a representative for the hong kong and macau affairs office (hkmao) said the presiding judge had received threatening phone calls, which the office said would not be tolerated. ""this is a serious threat to the personal safety of judges, a flagrant challenge to the judicial system in hong kong and a gross violation of the rule of law and order in hong kong,"" xinhua quoted a statement by hkmao as saying late on sunday. the statement followed one by hong kong's department of justice late on friday that said a judge had been intimidated, without providing details. on friday, judge amanda woodcock sentenced lai, an ardent critic of beijing, to 14 months in jail, and nine others to up to 18 months for their roles in the rally. hong kong arrested more than 10,000 people over anti-government protests in 2019, and some of those cases are now making their way through the court system. the unrest led beijing to impose a contentious national security law on its freest city in june 2020, and more than 100 people have been arrested under the law so far, including lai. the law punishes what beijing broadly defines as secession, sedition, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in jail. forty-seven democracy activists charged with conspiracy to commit subversion are set to appear in court on monday, in a case that has drawn criticism from western governments and international rights groups. hong kong returned to chinese rule in 1997 with a guarantee of a high degree of autonomy until 2047.  critics say authorities are chipping away at those freedoms, an assertion officials in hong kong and beijing reject.

""when you get into politics, you know there could be repercussions, but never to this degree"" said alonso, 36, from his sickbed.  the fuerza por mexico candidate for mayor of acapulco, jose alberto alonso gutierrez, speaks from the hospital where he is recovering from the attack.  photograph: david guzmán/epa mexico has suffered an especially bloody and violent campaign season ahead of midterm elections on 6 june when the country will renew its 500-seat lower house of congress, pick governors in 15 of its 32 states and elect hundreds of mayors and local legislators.  at least 34 candidates have been murdered since campaigning started on 6 april, while dozens more have been targeted and attacked.  mexican authorities have logged 398 threats or attacks on candidates.  much of the violence occurs in states like guerrero, south of mexico city, where numerous crime factions battle over the opium poppy trade and run extortion rackets and kidnapping rings in acapulco.  few cases are ever solved, though the federal government has been providing protection to candidates in rough corners of the country.  forensic investigators work at a scene where assailants left a package and a threat message taped to the gate of the house of leticia castillo, a candidate of the social encounter party (pes) in ciudad juárez earlier this month.  photograph: josé luis gonzález/reuters ""criminal groups have learned their lesson over the past few years that no matter what they do – including killing candidates or attacking public institutions – there are no consequences,"" said falko ernst, senior mexico analyst for the international crisis group.  ""if we look at the performance of mexican judicial institutions in actually solving the murders of politicians, it's pretty much zero.  that creates huge incentives to kill candidates and get away with it. "" many of the attacks target candidates for local government as criminal groups seek to increase their territorial control.  ""the point of gaining control over the next mayor is to assure that this mayor guarantees access to two prize resources: public money and the police,"" said gema kloppe-santamaría, a mexican crime investigator at loyola university chicago.  campaigning has been suspended in dozens of municipalities around the country due to violence.  the ruling morena party stopped campaigning in the southern part of the state of mexico – the country's most populous region, which wraps around mexico city – after an ambush in march killed 13 state and federal police officers.  morena's party president mario delgado tweeted on friday that he and two other politicians were intercepted by gunmen with assault weapons in the state of tamaulipas, a hotbed of organised crime, but released unharmed.  ""there are some municipalities where you campaign, but can't talk about municipal matters, others where you can bring in a campaign team, but can't hold rallies,"" said isaac monroy, the morena delegate in state of mexico.  the attacks have been brazen.  earlier in may, a former state prosecutor was gunned down on a street while campaigning for mayor in northern sonora.  on tuesday, alma barragán was killed while holding a rally in the conflict-riven state of guanajuato.  president andrés manuel lópez obrador says his government is providing protection for candidates.  but he also accused the media of sensationalising the murders to make his government look bad.  criminal groups often offer public servants the choice of ""silver or lead"" – take their bribes or face death.  ""there's a lot of blackmail, and those who say no end up like this,"" said ramón bernal garcía, a former detective running with the small fuerza por méxico party near mexico city.  some violence and intimidation is also down to rival political parties, bernal said.  a bodyguard for institutional revolutionary party mayoral candidate guillermo valencia takes his assault rifle from the back of the armoured suv they travel in, during one of valencia's campaign stops in morelia, michoacan state.  photograph: marco ugarte/ap alonso never received any threats, although he says in retrospect there were signs of trouble.  campaign signs bearing his boyish face were stolen and vandalised.  some campaign staff received veiled warnings to stop their work.  he was still unable to say what motivated the assassination attempt – especially as fuerza por méxico, the party he helped found, is contesting its first election and polling in the low single digits nationally.  but he said he was determined to stay in the race.  ""i've received a lot of kind messages from people who are fed up with crime,"" he said.  ""it hit me today because i'm a candidate, but i'll be a spokesman for all those suffering violence here in acapulco.

2021-05-31,WP's Pritam Singh addresses Eunos residents' concerns over screening centre near their home.,"source: pritam singh / facebookthe workers' party (wp) chief and member of parliament (mp) for aljunied grc pritam singh took to his facebook on saturday (29 may) to address the many concerns from eunos residents regarding the recently-activated screening centre in their residential area. in his post, mr singh shared that the former bedok north secondary school (bnss) site in eunos was set up as a regional screening centre under the charge of the health promotion board (hpb) about two weeks ago. ""apart from carrying out daily swabbing, after 1pm, the centre is reserved to cater for vehicles conveying persons under quarantine.  at another end of the centre, an area has been set aside to test individuals displaying symptoms of ari (acute respiratory infection),"" he wrote. according to mr singh, the activation of the screening centre has affected residents living at jalan damai in the eunos ward of aljunied grc, in particular those at blk 662-664. he noted that the hdb service roads near their blocks have been congested with vehicles, workers, etc.  while enforcement operations have been conducted against errant drivers, he stated that they were opportunistic and sporadic. mr singh added that there is also the concern of many workers walking to and from the screening centre through the void decks of their blocks. ""i have visited the screening centre a few times now to talk with hpb officers and to see how the problem can be alleviated,"" he shared. during his visit, mr singh fortuitously stumbled upon an acquaintance from his national service days, mr chin, who apparently is part of the hpb team in charge of all the seven screening centres in the eastern part of singapore. ""in view of the feedback, small lorries have been diverted into the screening centre to park after embarking/disembarking workers from today. ""hpb is also looking to deploy more traffic marshalls to better control traffic while maintaining safety considerations for users of the screening centre, and in doing so, reducing the prospect of congestion and illegal parking at blk 662-664,"" he elaborated. mr singh added that the hpb team is also looking at alternative parking options within the bnss site which require some site preparation, so as to contain activities within the screening centre as far as possible. ""to the residents of jalan damai, i know it has been a challenging two weeks so far, especially with many of you working from home,"" he acknowledged. mr singh went on to ask for residents' understanding on the situation, while assuring that the hpb team are doing their best to reduce inconvenience to everyone. ""even so, do drop your feedback to me anytime at [email protected] and i will do my best and work with the agencies involved to make things better,"" he concluded.  © 2006 2021 the online citizen©

""for me, playing on clay is a work in progress,"" said the reigning us and australian open champion, who has never won a wta title on the surface and has never gotten past the third round here, on a sun-kissed court philippe chatrier.

""in beating the reigning us open champion, andujar, 35, claimed his biggest career scalp.  the world no.  68 has been in giant-killing form of late, upsetting 20-time major winner roger federer of switzerland at the geneva open earlier this month. he said: ""it's a very special moment because i'm 35 and i don't know how long i'm going to play.  i had to believe to be able to get this result.  it was very difficult, in the third set he wasn't quite as strong. ""the other notable upset of the day saw former world no.  1 angelique kerber beaten 6-2, 6-4 by ukrainian qualifier anhelina kalinina.  the german has never made it past the quarter-finals here despite winning the other three slams once each and her wretched record in paris never looked like improving, suffering her third opening loss in a row. kerber, who has dropped to world no.  27 after poor form over the past two-plus years, just wants to put the french open behind her and focus on the upcoming grass-court swing, which is better suited for her counter-punching style.

2021-05-31,Football: Zidane says Real's lack of faith led to his departure.,"madrid: zinedine zidane said on monday he had stepped down as real madrid coach as the club's hierarchy did not have enough faith in him to rebuild an ageing squad. zidane, who returned to real for a second spell in charge in march 2019, won two la liga titles and three champions league crowns during his two stints as coach. however, he stepped down last week after real suffered their first trophyless season in 11 years, finishing second in la liga, being knocked out of the champions league semi-finals and suffering a humiliating copa del rey exit in the round of 32 to third division minnows alcoyano. in an open letter published in sports daily as, zidane said the first time he left as coach in 2018 was because he felt the team needed a new approach to stay at the highest level after enjoying so much success. ""right now, things are different,"" he said.  ""i'm leaving because i feel the club no longer has the faith in me i need, nor the support to build something in the medium or long term.

2021-05-31,"Ardern and Morrison present united front on China, warning of ‘those who seek to divide us’.","australian and new zealand prime ministers talk up closeness of ties as ardern is forced to defend 'soft' stance on beijing last modified on mon 31 may 2021 07. 18 bstthe australian prime minister, scott morrison, has warned that ""there are those far from here that would seek to divide us"", during a press conference with his new zealand counterpart, jacinda ardern, that focused on how the two countries handle china. the leaders emphasised unity in the face of beijing's increasing regional influence and morrison said any forces trying to scupper the partnership would not succeed. the question of how to respond to the rise of china – and perceived differences in the two countries' approaches – dominated both prime ministers' comments at their first in-person talks since the pandemic began.  talking to the press in queenstown, new zealand, on monday, ardern and morrison sought to present a united front on china and international trade and security issues. ""i have no doubt there will be those who seek to undermine australia and new zealand's security by trying to create points of difference that are not there,"" morrison said. he said the ""direct personal relationship"" between him and ardern ""will only continue, because we have common challenges.  there are common threats. ""while the initial comments on ""those who seek to divide"" were made in response to questions on china, morrison would not comment on whether he was referring to the country directly.  ""people always try to divide new zealand, all over the place,"" he said. ardern was forced to defend new zealand's position, which has been characterised in the australian press as soft or cosying up to beijing.  ""[i] directly and strongly refute the assertion that nz is doing anything other than taking a very principled position on human rights issues, on trade issues as they relate to china,"" she said. ""at no point in our discussions today did i detect any difference in our relative positions on the importance of maintaining a very strong and principled perspective""morrison answered with a straight ""no"" when asked if new zealand had 'sold its soul' to china.  ""australia and new zealand are trading nations, but neither of us would ever trade our sovereignty or our values,"" he said. ardern said the two countries had ""broadly been positioned in exactly the same place"" on major human rights and trade policy statements.  new zealand has joined australia on a number of key statements raising concerns about china's conduct in hong kong and xinjiang – but its stance has been interpreted as softer across the tasman.  in april, the foreign minister, nanaia mahuta, said new zealand was ""uncomfortable"" expanding its invocation of the five eyes alliance with australia, canada, the uk and the us beyond intelligence matters, into wider policy statements.  that stance has led some to call new zealand the ""weak link"" of the alliance. but ardern shot down the proposition that new zealand's standing in the five eyes network could be downgraded.  ""the answer to that question is no,"" she said. ""we carry responsibility for ourselves to ensure adequate investment in our defence forces and equally, that we carry our weight as a member of the intelligence and security community. ""referring to the two allies' strong historic relationship, morrison said the two nations had carved out ""a uniquely anzac path through covid-19"" and ""must also continue to pursue an anzac path through the other issues"". morrison had opened talks with brief comments referencing regional pressures created by china.  ""the broader issue of the indo-pacific and a free and open indo-pacific is something that australia and new zealand feels very strongly about,"" he said.  ""all of us have a big stake in ensuring a world that favours freedom and a free and open indo-pacific. ""the indo-pacific includes the hotly contested south china sea, where china has been increasing its military presence and island-building – dumping sand on to small atolls to create larger islands that can host military bases.  the association of southeast asian nations has said those efforts ""may undermine peace, security and stability"" in the region.  the australian military is actively patrolling the south china sea, and in may, the new zealand defence minister, peeni henare, said the country's navy would be joining a british flotilla tour of the indo-pacific and south china sea later this year. asked directly about the prospect of conflict with china over the south china sea or taiwan, morrison responded that ""the world is being characterised by increased strategic competition between the united states and china"", but that competition ""doesn't need to lead to increased likelihood of conflict"". both australia and new zealand are highly dependent on china for trade.  china accounts for around 30% of new zealand's exports, and $33bn of total trade.  china is also australia's largest export market, but over the past year, that's been hurt by a deteriorating relationship between canberra and beijing in a trade war that cost australia an estimated $47. 7bn last year. also on the table was new zealand's frustration at australia's ""501"" policy of deporting citizens who commit a crime – even if they have lived in australia for most of their lives.  the policy has been a simmering ""sore point"" between the two nations, mahuta has said.  at the last set of talks between the two leaders, ardern publicly rebuked morrison for the policy.  ""do not deport your people and your problems,"" she said. this year, ardern said she had once again made clear new zealand's position on the deportations.  the issue seems to be at a stalemate, with no movement from australia. despite those disagreements, ardern also continued to emphasise the connections between the two nations, saying that ""when we talk about australia and new zealand being family, being whānau [the māori word for extended family], we actually mean that quite literally as much as we mean it symbolically"". ""as with any family, we will have our differences from time to time but those differences are still undertaken in the spirit of openness and ultimately friendship.  we are much bigger than our differences – the last year has taught us that,"" she said. a joint statement released by the two leaders outlined the countries' shared positions, which included statements on xinjiang, hong kong, and ""serious concern over developments in the south china sea, including the continued militarisation of disputed features and an intensification of destabilising activities at sea"". it also outlined a series of positions that, while not referencing china specifically, point to shared concerns over beijing's influence in the region.  they committed to supporting sovereign states in the indo-pacific, and said those countries must be able to ""pursue their interests free from coercion"".  they also cited shared commitments to ""countering foreign interference"".  both leaders ""expressed concern over harmful economic coercion and agreed to work with partners to tackle security and economic challenges. "" on saturday, new zealand opted to join as a third party in australia's dispute with china over punitive tariffs on barley, as it goes to the wto.

partnership would not succeed."", ""the question of how to respond to the rise of china – and perceived differences in the two countries' approaches – dominated both prime ministers' comments at their first in-person talks since the pandemic began."", 'talking to the press in queenstown, new zealand, on monday, ardern and morrison sought to present a united front on china and international trade and security issues.', '""i have no doubt there will be those who seek to undermine australia and new zealand\'s security by trying to create points of difference that are not there,"" morrison said.', 'he said the ""direct personal relationship"" between him and ardern ""will only continue, because we have common challenges.', 'there are common threats.', '""while the initial comments on ""those who seek to divide"" were made in response to questions on china, morrison would not comment on whether he was referring to the country directly.', '""people always try to divide new zealand, all over the place,"" he said.', ""ardern was forced to defend new zealand's position, which has been characterised in the australian press as soft or cosying up to beijing."", '""[i] directly and

our discussions today did i detect any difference in our relative positions on the importance of maintaining a very strong and principled perspective""morrison answered with a straight ""no"" when asked if new zealand had \'sold its soul\' to china.', '""australia and new zealand are trading nations, but neither of us would ever trade our sovereignty or our values,"" he said.', 'ardern said the two countries had ""broadly been positioned in exactly the same place"" on major human rights and trade policy statements.', ""new zealand has joined australia on a number of key statements raising

dependent on china for trade.', ""china accounts for around 30% of new zealand's exports, and $33bn of total trade."", ""china is also australia's largest export market, but over the past year, that's

australia\'s ""501"" policy of deporting citizens who commit a crime – even if they have lived in australia for most of their lives.', 'the policy has been a simmering ""sore point"" between the two nations, mahuta has said.', 'at the last set of talks between the two leaders, ardern publicly rebuked morrison for the policy.', '""do not deport your people and your problems,"" she said.', ""this year, ardern said she had once again made clear new zealand's position on the deportations."", 'the issue seems to be at a stalemate, with no movement from australia.', 'despite those disagreements,

""even paying $710,000 and a wait of more than five years is no deterrent to buyers who desire the location and the potential upside of the transformation in years to come,"" he said. the last time new flats were launched in bukit merah was eight years ago. the other bto project in a mature estate in this month's sales exercise, which will conclude at 11. 59pm on monday, was also popular, although demand was less competitive. the 1,010 four-room flats in macpherson weave in geylang attracted four first-time applicants for each unit.  the 156 three-room flats attracted fewer than two applicants for each.

in the non-mature estate of woodlands, the 359 five-room flats in woodgrove ascent were the most in demand, drawing close to four first-time applicants for each unit. its 411 four-room and 84 three-room units also attracted more than three first-time applicants for each available unit. prices start from $185,000 for a three-room flat, $275,000 for a four-room flat and $372,000 for a five-room unit, making them the most affordable in this sales exercise.

similarly, the 251 five-room flats in garden bloom @ tengah had more than three first-time applicants each, while the 265 four-room units had three first-time applicants vying for each. in both woodlands and tengah, buyers will have to wait for just under four years for the flats.  both projects are slated to be completed in the third quarter of 2025.

propnex chief executive ismail gafoor said the overall rate of 4. 3 applicants to each available unit in this launch was down marginally from the 4. 6 seen in the february bto sales exercise. ""a potential reason for the slight moderation may be the increased uncertainty around completion dates and a longer waiting time for flats as a result of construction delays,"" he said. however, ms christine sun, senior vice-president of research and analytics at orangetee & tie, noted that the overall application rate is considered healthy despite the government's warnings of construction delays due to covid-19. ""the rising prices of hdb resale flats and private properties may be a factor.  to many people, bto flats are still considered more affordable and worth the wait,"" she said. in august, hdb will launch about 4,900 flats in queenstown, kallang/whampoa, tampines, jurong east and hougang. another 3,100 to 3,600 units flats will be offered in choa chu kang, hougang, jurong west, kallang/whampoa and tengah in november, with exact site locations to be released in august. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-05-31,Beijing's Hong Kong office slams intimidation of judge in tycoon Jimmy Lai's case.,"hong kong: beijing's office that oversees matters in hong kong has warned of threats made to a judge who sentenced media tycoon jimmy lai and other democracy activists for their roles in an unauthorised assembly on oct 1, 2019. a representative for the hong kong and macau affairs office (hkmao) said the presiding judge had received threatening phone calls, which the office said would not be tolerated. ""this is a serious threat to the personal safety of judges, a flagrant challenge to the judicial system in hong kong and a gross violation of the rule of law and order in hong kong,"" xinhua quoted a statement by hkmao as saying late on sunday (may 30). the statement followed one by hong kong's department of justice late on friday that said a judge had been intimidated, without providing details. on friday, judge amanda woodcock sentenced lai, an ardent critic of beijing, to14 months in jail, and nine others to up to 18 months for their roles in the rally. hong kong arrested more than 10,000 people over anti-government protests in 2019, and some of those cases are now making their way through the court system. the unrest led beijing to impose a contentious national security law on the city in june 2020, and more than 100 people have been arrested under the law so far, including lai. the law punishes what beijing broadly defines as secession, sedition, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in jail. forty-seven democracy activistscharged with conspiracy to commit subversion are set to appear in court on monday, in a case that has drawn criticism from western governments and international rights groups. hong kong returned to chinese rule in 1997 with a guarantee of a high degree of autonomy until 2047.  critics say authorities are chipping away at those freedoms, an assertion officials in hong kong and beijing reject. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-05-31,Zidane says he quit Real Madrid because of club’s lack of ‘faith’.,"loading. . . monday, 31 may 2021 05:28 pm myt

in this file photo taken april 03, 2021 real madrid coach zinedine zidane reacts during the spanish league football match between real madrid cf and sd eibar at the alfredo di stefano stadium in valdebebas, april 3, 2021.  — afp pic

""i'm leaving because i feel the club no longer has the faith in me i need, and doesn't offer me the support to build something in the medium or long term,"" the frenchman wrote in the letter published in the sports daily as. ""i am a born winner and i was here to win trophies, but beyond this there are human beings, emotions, life and i have the feeling that these things have not been valued, that it has not been understood that this is also how the dynamic of a great club is maintained,"" he said. ""but everything i built on a daily basis, what i brought to the relationship with the players. . .  has been forgotten. "" ""i'm leaving, but i'm not jumping ship and i'm not tired of coaching,"" he said. real had a disappointing season, finishing second in la liga behind neigbours atletico madrid and losing to eventual winners chelsea in the champions league semi-finals. it is the second time that zidane has resigned as real madrid manager. the 1998 world cup winner first took the helm in january 2016 and guided real to the 2017 la liga title and an unprecedented hat-trick of champions league titles before abruptly quitting on may 31, 2018. less than a year later he returned after julen lopetegui and santiago solari were sacked as managers in quick succession. in his letter zidane said he left the club in 2018 because it needed ""a different voice to keep itself at the highest"" but this time ""things are different"". ""i want what we have achieved together to be respected.  i would have liked in recent months my relationship with the club and with the president (florentino perez) to have been a little different from that of other coaches,"" zidane said. ""i wasn't asking for privileges, of course not, but a little more memory,"" added zidane. 'always grateful' zidane's contract with real was set to expire in 2022 but he had repeatedly refused to confirm he would still be at the club next season. he has a history of making surprise announcements: as a player, he initially announced his retirement from international football in 2004 before coming back for the 2006 world cup, after which he retired for good following his red card for butting on italy's marco materazzi as france lost the final. ""spending 20 years in madrid has been the most beautiful thing that has ever happened to me in life and i know that i owe it exclusively to florentino perez who bet on me in 2001,"" zidane said in the letter. ""i say it from the heart, i will always be grateful to the 'presi' for it.  always,"" he added. zidane now take another break from football although there has been talk of him either taking charge of the french national team or juventus, where he spent five years as a player. juventus are suffering financially as a result of the covid-19 pandemic and might not be in a position to entice him. didier deschamps, who led france to victory in the last world cup,  is likely to remain national coach until the 2022 world cup in qatar, barring a disastrous performance at the european championship that kicks off next month.  — afploading. . . © 2021, malay mail, all rights reserved.

2021-05-31,Travel industry tops consumer complaints in 2020 amid COVID-19 restrictions: CASE.,"singapore: complaints against the travel industry topped the list of consumer woes amid the covid-19 pandemic last year, according to data released by the consumers association of singapore (case) on monday (may 31). case received a total of 18,335 complaints across all industries last year, a 23 per cent jump from the 14,867 complaints the previous year. the pandemic has ""reshaped"" the composition of consumer complaints, said the association, with about one in seven complaints last year related to it. the biggest impact was felt in the travel and airline industries, with two out of five complaints in these industries stemming from covid-19 travel restrictions, said case. travel businesses received a total of 1,800 complaints, more than three times the amount the previous year. the airlines, medical consumables, clubs and hotels industries also saw sharp increases in complaints, said case. reports against the beauty, motorcars and renovation contractors industries dropped slightly due to pandemic restrictions, but these remain priority areas, it added. with more people turning to online shopping and digital transactions last year, the number of complaints related to online purchases jumped 95 per cent to reach 4,366 last year, added case. the most common e-commerce complaints were related to defective or non-conforming goods, and delayed deliveries or missing products, it said. travel and flight bookingsthe travel and airline industries received about 50 per cent of all pandemic-related complaints, said case. people who cancelled or postponed tour packages, flights or hotel bookings due to global travel restrictions complained that they were unable to get back their deposits or prepayments. some were charged a penalty or administrative fee for postponing their trips, while others were given travel vouchers to be used at a later date instead of a cash refund. case said it assisted affected consumers by leveraging the covid-19 (temporary measures) act 2020, which provides them with temporary relief from contractual obligations to be performed on or after feb 1, 2020, for contracts entered into or renewed before mar 25, 2020. for disputes with travel agents and hotels that case could not resolve, it guided consumers to file cases with an assessor from the ministry of law, also provided for under the act. the association said it approached airlines that received a higher number of complaints to urge them to offer flexibility in the use of travel vouchers, and the right of reimbursement if travel vouchers are not used. case said it also engaged two local travel associations to urge their members to offer consumers a full refund for prepayments made for tour packages. in total, case helped consumers recover more than s$300,000 in prepayments from airlines, travel agencies and travel portals, it added. gym membershipsgyms and fitness studios received 356 complaints last year – a 91 per cent increase over the previous year – amid covid-19 restrictions on these businesses. people with prepaid memberships sought case's help to obtain an extension or partial refund as they were unable to use the facilities when gyms and fitness studios shut for a few months last year, said the association. gyms and fitness studios were not allowed to operate from april to june last year, during the ""circuit breaker"" and phase 1 of reopening. consumers also found it difficult to book their preferred exercise slots due to capacity reduction in line with safe distancing measures, and sought a full or partial refund on their memberships, said case. event bookingsthe bridal, hotels and restaurants industries received 169 pandemic-related complaints last year.  many people who were unable or did not wish to proceed with event bookings due to the circuit breaker and phased reopening measures faced difficulty getting back their deposits, said case. some bridal salons and hotels were only willing to postpone the date of the event or cited clauses claiming that bookings made are non-refundable, added the association. case said consumers recovered more than s$97,000 worth of prepayments from their event contracts with its assistance. face masksthe medical and medical consumables industry received 1,256 complaints last year, of which at least 813 were in relation to medical consumables.  consumers generally complained about the pricing of face masks, hand sanitisers and other related consumables, said case. some consumers also said they were misled about the quality or efficacy of face and surgical masks. case said it worked closely with the ministry of trade and industry and competition and consumer commission of singapore to monitor and flag profiteering behaviour and unfair practices. beauty and carscomplaints against the beauty industry and motorcars industry dropped to 1,363 and 1,180 respectively last year.  this was likely due to the closure of non-essential businesses during the circuit breaker, said case. about one-third of complaints lodged against beauty businesses were related to unfair practices such as aggressive sales tactics. some consumers complained that they were led to believe they were paying promotional prices for beauty treatments, but were subsequently pressured to purchase higher-end treatments at higher prices, said case. responding to complaints, case signed voluntary compliance agreements with three beauty salons that committed to cease unfair practices. in the motorcars industry, about 36 per cent of complaints were related to defective vehicles.  they generally involved consumers discovering defects in the car after purchase and seeking recourse from the dealers to no avail. case said it rolled out an online campaign encouraging consumers to send their pre-owned vehicles for independent evaluation before making a purchase, and to educate consumers on their recourse under the lemon law. of the total complaints received across all industries last year, consumers were given advice on how to follow up directly with businesses in 87. 4 per cent of instances, said case. the remaining 12. 6 per cent were filed with case, and involved the association negotiating or mediating with the businesses on behalf of consumers. about 70 per cent of filed cases were resolved, with nearly s$2. 8 million in cash and in kind recovered for consumers. with covid-19 drastically changing the consumer landscape, case will ""strive to be relevant and respond to the needs of consumers on the ground in these challenging times"", said case president lim biow chuan. ""given the shift in consumer shopping behaviour, case will continue to do more to educate consumers on how to protect themselves should purchases go awry.

2021-05-31,China allows couples to have three children: state media.,"china is relaxing its family planning policy to allow couples to have up to three children/afpchina has relaxed its family planning policy to allow couples to have a maximum of three children after a census showed its population is rapidly ageing, state media xinhua reported monday. for almost 40 years, china enforced a controversial ""one-child policy"" — one of the strictest family planning regulations worldwide — which was lifted in 2016 due to widespread concerns over an ageing workforce and economic stagnation. ""to actively respond to the ageing of the population . . .  a couple can have three children,"" xinhua said, citing a monday meeting of china's elite politburo leadership committee hosted by president xi jinping. despite government efforts to encourage childbirths, china's annual births have continued to plummet to a record low of 12 million in 2020, the national bureau of statistics said last month. china's fertility rate stands at 1. 3 — below the level needed to maintain a stable population, the bureau revealed. the once-in-a-decade 2020 census results published last month also showed that china's population grew at its slowest rate since the 1960s, reaching 1. 41 billion. it comes alongside a sharp drop in the number of working-age people, once again raising fears of a looming demographic crisis. china's gender balance has also been skewed by decades of the one-child policy, and a traditional social preference for boys which prompted a generation of sex-selective abortions and abandoned baby girls. — afp © 2006 2021 the online citizen© 2006 2021 the online

2021-05-31,Tennis: Osaka fined and threatened with French Open default over media boycott.,"paris: japanese superstar naomi osaka was on sunday (may 30) threatened with disqualification from the french open if she persists with her controversial media boycott, officials said. ""we have advised naomi osaka that should she continue to ignore her media obligations, she would be exposing herself to possible further code of conduct infringement consequences,"" said a statement from the four grand slam tournaments after issuing the world number two with a us$15,000 fine. ""as might be expected, repeat violations attract tougher sanctions including default from the tournament. ""osaka, a four-time grand slam title winner and sport's highest-earning female athlete, was fined for refusing to hold a press conference after her opening 6-4, 7-6 (7/4) victory over romanian world number 63 patricia maria tig. the 23-year-old had said on the eve of the tournament that she would refuse to carry out any media obligations, claiming news conferences are detrimental to her mental health. she believes traditional post-match inquests are akin to ""kicking people when they're down"". however, the four grand slam events wimbledon, the french, australian and us opens issued a joint statement, saying they had written to osaka ""to check on her well-being and offer support"". ""she was also reminded of her obligations, the consequences of not meeting them and that rules should equally apply to all players. ""naomi osaka today chose not to honour her contractual media obligations.  the roland garros referee has therefore issued her a us$15,000 fine. ""after her match on sunday, osaka agreed only to a cursory on-court tv interview. ""for me, playing on clay is a work in progress,"" said the reigning us and australian open champion on a sun-kissed court philippe chatrier. ""hopefully the more i play, the better i will become. ""and that was that from a player who has now strung together 15 successive grand slam match wins. osaka, who has never got past the third round in paris, fired 39 winners but committed 35 unforced errors against tig to set up a second round duel against another romanian player, ana bogdan. ""honour commitments""the grand slam heads also said osaka's refusal to take part in media duties put opponents at a disadvantage. ""there is nothing more important than ensuring no player has an unfair advantage over another, which unfortunately is the case in this situation if one player refuses to dedicate time to participate in media commitments while the others all honour their commitments. ""if osaka was to be disqualified, it would be as infamous as novak djokovic's default at last year's us open where the world number was booted out for hitting a line judge with a ball. osaka's defiant stand overshadowed the opening day of the 2021 french open. petra kvitova, a semi-finalist in 2012 and 2020, saved a match point before seeing off belgian qualifier greet minnen, 6-7 (3/7), 7-6 (7-5), 6-1. the 11th seeded czech, a two-time wimbledon champion, blitzed 43 winners but served up 11 double faults against her 125th-ranked opponent. fresh from her first career clay court title in madrid, belarusian third seed aryna sabalenka eased past croatian qualifier ana konjuh 6-4, 6-3. three-time major winner angelique kerber, the german 26th seed and twice a quarter-finalist in paris, lost to ukrainian qualifier anhelina kalinina 6-2, 6-4. the win was a 14th successive win for the world number 139 kalinina across all tournaments. later sunday, men's world number five stefanos tsitsipas faces home player jeremy chardy. the greek is widely tipped as a potential champion should 13-time winner rafael nadal or world number one novak djokovic falter. tsitsipas has already captured the monte carlo masters and lyon titles on clay this season. crowd limitesalso in action sunday is fourth seed dominic thiem, the 2018 and 2019 runner-up to nadal. us open champion thiem faces spanish veteran pablo andujar who defeated roger federer on clay in geneva last week. in total, just over 5,000 spectators a day will be admitted at the roland garros site until june 8 under covid-19 limits. that figure will then rise to more than 13,000 a day thanks to the government's decision to raise fan numbers to a 65 per cent limit of capacity. the main setback for organisers, however, is that nine of their scheduled 10 evening sessions an innovation for 2021 will be played behind closed doors. a government curfew of 9pm will not be lifted until jun 9. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-05-31,Real Madrid: Zidane stabs Real Madrid and Florentino Perez in the back.,"editions:en/football/real-madridraul varela gives his opinionjust when lionel messi's burofax seemed like being the most talked-about document in spanish football's recent history, zinedine zidane writes an eye-raising open letter revealing the reasons why he has left real madrid for a third time. zidane writes this letter with a grin as sharp as the knife he uses to stab real madrid and, especially, their president and his friend, florentino perez, in the back. a lack of confidence and retrospect, leaks, little support and the absence of a project. . .  he leaves nothing that happened in his final few months of the club to the imagination, all while he was aiming for success in laliga santander and the champions league, although the trophy cabinet didn't open so easily this time. florentino must now decide whether he's going to hide behind a superficial club statement, like the one that was sent out to communicate zidane's exit after a 30-minute meeting, or whether he's going to, like with the european super league, come out and explain the reasons why a club icon like the frenchman, a key figure in the most successful era in the club's history who the president admires greatly, has decided to leave his post. this time, zidane has spoken his mind and shared, via the press who he also attacks for their questions and search for controversy, his version of events.  these events piled up at real madrid over the course of a few weeks that saw them scrape through the champions league group stages, get humiliated by alcoyano in the copa del rey and face a mountain to climb in catching up with the leaders in laliga santander, plus the difficulty in managing a trimmed first-team squad.  the season ended with the side runners-up in the league and reaching the last four of the easy side of the champions league draw. zidane's exit from real madrid seems like, with the passing of

""if i lived somewhere else with less testing options and undetermined turnaround times, i'd probably be more annoyed,"" added ms wong, who is returning home today to renew her united states work visa and to see her family after being away for 11/2 years. she noted, though, that the new test requirement does not appear to take into account singaporeans or prs who have already been vaccinated, or that individuals may still test positive even though they may no longer be infectious. she said: ""i'm pretty sure i'll test negative because i'm fully vaccinated and i am still cautious.  but there is that little bit of a 'what if'. ""mr samuel phua, 23, who is coming home next month after graduating from the sibelius academy in finland, is also somewhat anxious about the pre-departure test. ""it is allergy season here, and pollen allergies and covid-19 have symptoms that are quite similar.  i got myself tested recently and my results were negative, but there's always that sliver of doubt and worry that the next one may be positive.

2021-05-31,"New Zealand, Australia play down differences on China.","wellington: new zealand and australia downplayed policy differences on china on monday (may 31), with prime minister jacinda ardern denying wellington was taking a soft stance on human rights to avoid offending its largest trading partner. ardern's government has taken flak over its meek criticisms of china's rights record, while australia's more outspoken position has drawn punitive trade measures from beijing. the centre-left new zealand leader insisted the trans-tasman allies were lock-step on attitudes towards china afterholding talks with her australian counterpart scott morrisonin the south island mountain retreat of queenstown. the pair issued a joint statement expressing ""deep concern"" at the erosion of freedoms in hong kong and the treatment of the uyghur muslim minority in china's xinjiang province. ""you'll see that australia and new zealand have broadly been positioned in exactly the same place on these issues consistently,"" ardern told reporters. ""so i really push back on any suggestion that we are not taking a strong stance on these incredibly important issues. ""ardern and morrison also backed a push to further investigate the origins of the covid-19 pandemic, which remains a sensitive topic for china. the new zealand government declined to sign a statement from the five eyes intelligence network last year condemning developments in hong kong, and this month insisted on removing the word ""genocide"" from a parliamentary motion about the plight of the uyghurs. australia has fully backed the five eyes statements, sparking fiery rhetoric from beijing along with import levies on a range of australian products. morrison said he did not believe new zealand was a weak link in the spy network, which also includes the united states, the united kingdom and canada. ""neither of us will ever trade our sovereignty or our values, we have stood side by side to defend those values,"" he said. morrison said both australia and new zealand wanted a free and peaceful indo-pacific region and would work to ensure that goal was not threatened by rising china-us tensions. ""the world is being characterised by increased strategic competition between the united states and china, that is a self-evident fact,"" he said. ""i would say our shared view is that such strategic competition does not need to lead to increased likelihood of conflict. ""ardern also glossed over other irritants in the trans-tasman relationship, including canberra's policy of deporting new zealand-born criminals even if they have been in australia for most of their lives.

2021-05-31,B1617 variant spreading worldwide at 'frightening speed': Experts.,"singapore, may 31 (ians): the b1617 covid-19 variant is spreading worldwide at 'frightening speed' and could aggravate the pandemic -- particularly in countries with low vaccination rates, according to the latest assessment of the virus by experts here. the b1617 strain is becoming increasingly dominant worldwide and this will not be the last time that the virus mutates, the strait times reported on sunday. ""what is frightening is the speed at which this variant is able to spread and circulate widely within the community, often surpassing the capability of contact-tracing units to track and isolate exposed contacts to break the transmission chains, a professor teo yik ying, dean of the national university of singapore's (nus) saw swee hock school of public health, was quoted as saying. ""it has the potential to unleash a bigger pandemic storm than the world has previously seen,"" ying added. b1617 has mutated to spread more easily from person to person and may dampen the protection conferred by vaccines as well as natural infection, though only slightly, experts say. the variant, which was first detected in india in october 2020, is now present in more than 50 countries and is surpassing other strains causing infections, according to the world health organization (who).  earlier this month, the global health body declared it as a ""variant of global concern"". the strain is 1. 5 times to two times more transmissible than the strain that first appeared in wuhan 18 months ago.  there are three versions of b1617 -- b16171, b16172 and b16173.  the second version is the most relevant as it has appeared to overtake b16171 in local cases as well as those reported globally.  the third version, b16173, is rare, the report said. while it remains unclear if b1617 causes more serious illness or deaths, the best weapon remains widespread vaccination.  vaccinated individuals have a reduced chance of being infected, and a much lower likelihood of developing severe symptoms even if they are infected, teo said. various researches have shown that the pfizer, moderna and astrazeneca vaccines are effective against b1617. however, most countries, unfortunately, are lagging far behind in vaccinating their people as global inequity in vaccine supplies and distribution persists. this means a higher chance of b1617 creeping into countries previously minimally affected by covid-19, professor dale fisher, chair of the who's global outbreak alert and response network, was quoted as saying. ""these countries, such as thailand, cambodia, laos and vietnam, are more vulnerable due to the low vaccination rates, leaving them more susceptible to severe disease,"" fisher said.   its like some one systematically eliminating people .    pharma mafiadisclaimer:please write your correct name and email address.  kindly do not post any personal, abusive, defamatory, infringing, obscene, indecent, discriminatory or unlawful or similar comments.  daijiworld. com will not be responsible for any defamatory message posted under this article.  please note that sending false messages to insult, defame, intimidate, mislead or deceive people or to intentionally cause public disorder is punishable under law.  it is obligatory on daijiworld to provide the ip address and other details of senders of such comments, to the authority concerned upon request. hence, sending offensive comments using daijiworld will be purely at your own risk, and in no way will daijiworld. com be held responsible.

2021-05-31,"Taiwan says working hard to get Covid-19 vaccines as infections fall, East Asia News & Top Stories.","read 3 articles daily and stand to win st rewards, including the st news tablet worth $398. spin the wheel for st read and win now. taipei (reuters) taiwan is working hard to get the almost 20 million covid-19 vaccines it has ordered as soon as possible even in the face of global shortages, president tsai ing-wen said on monday (may 31), amid domestic pressure to speed up supplies even as infections fall. taiwan is ramping up its vaccination campaign amid a spike in domestic infections after months of relative safety, but has so far given shots to fewer than 2 per cent of its more than 23 million people, though millions of additional doses are on their way. in a live broadcast from the presidential office, ms tsai said with the pandemic remaining serious around the world, vaccine supplies had unable to keep up with demand, and all governments, including taiwan's, were working hard to get shots. ""all levels of government, including me, are keeping a close eye on the nearly 20 million vaccines ordered every day so they can be shipped as soon as possible and arrive earlier,"" she said. the island reported 347 domestic covid-19 cases on monday, including 73 cases added to the totals for recent days, as it continues to readjust its infection numbers amid delays in reporting positive tests. that marked the second consecutive day in which new cases were below 400, after a rare uptick in domestic cases concentrated in taipei and its nearby cities. the increase, which peaked this month, prompted the government to tighten curbs, including banning in-restaurant dining and gatherings. ""the pandemic is heading towards a stage where it can be controlled,"" health minister chen shih-chung told a daily news briefing, saying new cases continued to decline. mr chen said ""aggressive measures"" would remain in place for the one to two weeks, including fines for people not wearing face masks outside and a halt to wedding banquets and wakes. he said more stations for rapid covid-19 tests would be set up in taiwan's outlying islands, where medical resources are relatively limited. but the administration is facing pressure to speed up purchases, and has said local governments, companies and religious groups can buy them, though need to go through the central government for authorisation. taiwan's cabinet said on monday that economy minister wang mei-hua would act as coordinator for requests from companies. ms tsai said the government would work hard with those outside the government to get even more vaccines.  mr terry gou, the billionaire founder of major apple inc supplier foxconn, said on saturday his charity plans to apply to import five million doses of biontech se's covid-19 vaccine into taiwan.  biontech declined to comment. taiwan has accused china, which claims the island as a breakaway province, of blocking a deal earlier this year for biontech shots, which beijing denies. taiwan's parliament approved on monday an extra t$420 billion (s$20 billion) in stimulus spending to help the economy deal with the covid-19 pandemic. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

Only a global effort can tame COVID-19.","india has been witnessing an unprecedented surge in covid-19 cases, largely due to the new variants.  the variant found initially in the united kingdom (b. 1. 1. 7) was found in parts of north india earlier this year and began to spread across the country.  the world health organisation (who) recently declared the variant first found in india (b. 1. 617) as a variant of global concern as it has already spread to more than 40 countries.  this underscores the fact that no one is safe until everyone is safe.  it calls for globally coordinated efforts to build herd immunity through mass vaccination and to develop new vaccines or tweak the existing ones to become effective against the new variants.  experts have been doubtful about the effectiveness of some of the covid-19 vaccines against the new variants of the virus. an immediate outcome of the second wave in india is that many people are no longer hesitant to take the vaccine.  however, vaccine shortages have been reported in many parts of the country.  several people have criticised the government's vaccine maitri policy.  the government has already imposed temporary restrictions on the export of covid-19 vaccines from india.  although there is a need for these temporary restrictions to meet domestic demand, any definite move towards vaccine nationalism will be detrimental to global efforts to contain the virus.  the pandemic needs to be checked globally in a coordinated manner.  if this is not done, the virus will keep mutating and no country will remain isolated.  
only way to decrease variants of covid-19 is by increasing vaccination, says dr.  gagandeep kang
from may 1, all those aged 18 and above became eligible in india to receive the covid-19 vaccines.  this means that 595 million people who require 1,190 million doses were added to the 344 million people in the 45 and above age group requiring 688 million doses.  inoculating this huge population calls for massive production capacities.  only a little over 12% of the population has received one dose and 3. 2% has received both the doses in india so far. the current production capacity of covishield and covaxin is just over 70 million doses per month.  the government has allocated ₹45 billion as an advance commitment to serum institute of india and bharat biotech for enhancing their production capacity.  by june-july, in the best-case scenario, the combined production capacity of the two companies is expected to rise to 158 million doses per month.  the 50 million imported sputnik doses will add to this.  this vaccine will be available only in major private hospitals for now.  it is reported that the sputnik vaccine will be produced in india from july with an annual capacity of 156 million doses, which, according to the russian ambassador to india, will be gradually increased to 850 million doses.  even if all the three vaccines are exclusively used for domestic supply, the anticipated production in the near future will not be sufficient to meet the enormous vaccine demand. being the pharmacy of the world, india needs to rise to the occasion and cater to the demand for vaccines in the country as well as facilitate inoculation of the global population, especially in poorer countries.  in the first week of may, the indian council of medical research said it was willing to share the know-how to produce covaxin with any company interested in production.  allowing multiple producers will lead to more competition and a reduction in prices.  the government can easily task the public sector vaccine manufacturers with the production of covaxin by providing support to them.  in its attempt to enhance the production of covaxin from 12. 5 million doses to 58 million doses a month, the government of india has involved three public sector enterprises — haffkine biopharmaceutical corporation, bharat immunologicals and biologicals corporation limited, and indian immunologicals limited.   
nobel laureate's claim on variants | experts seek to dispel vaccine fears
while raising an alarm on the spread of infectious diseases, a 2020 report of the who on the urgent health challenges for the next decade expressed concern on the lack of access to medical products, including medicines and vaccines.  as infectious diseases are expected to increase in the coming years, india needs to frame a long-term strategy to enhance supply at the domestic and international level.  public sector enterprises should be an integral part of that strategy.  unfortunately, the public sector enterprise policy, released in february, has not identified public sector enterprises in the pharmaceuticals sector as strategically important, and therefore, all central public sector enterprises will subsequently be privatised. what we need now is the mass production of covid-19 vaccines for the mass vaccination of the global population in order for us to develop herd immunity against the virus.  india still has options left for scaling up production.  the national health profile 2019, published by the central bureau of health intelligence, ministry of health and family welfare, shows that india has an installed capacity of 8,151. 7 million doses of vaccines annually, in the private and public sectors.  a few of these facilities can be re-purposed for the production of covid-19 vaccines. scaling up production of existing vaccines and producing new vaccines is not easy.  unavailability of raw materials, complexities in the transfer of technology, and intellectual property barriers all hinder production.  serum institute and bharat biotech have faced constraints in continuing production due to the lack of raw materials.   
vaccination is our only weapon
intellectual property rights act as a major barrier in scaling up production.  about 1,800 patents cover the single-use plastic reactors which are used in the production of some of the covid-19 vaccines.  similarly, other equipment and materials used in the production of vaccines are patent-protected and therefore supplied by only a few players.  india and south africa had led an initiative at the world trade organization (wto) for the waiver of intellectual property rights over products required for treating covid-19.  recently, after coming under pressure, the u. s.  extended support to this proposal covering only vaccines.  however, germany said it is opposed to it.  therefore, it is unclear how this ip waiver proposal will help enhance the global production of vaccines.  besides, the u. s.  support, which is limited to vaccines, may also limit the benefits deriving from the intellectual property waiver, if the proposal comes through the wto. an article published in nature points out the benefits of mrna vaccine technology compared to conventional vaccine technologies.  the key advantage of this technology is easy scalability in production.  at present, the who has approved two mrna covid-19 vaccines produced by pfizer-biontech and moderna, and those vaccines have proven to be more effective than other vaccines.  global cooperation is needed to create an environment where those companies interested in producing the mrna vaccines get open license from the innovators.  
coronavirus | opeds and editorials
global cooperation is also required for the sequencing of the viral genome to track and control the multiple variants.  only if we tame the virus together and quickly will the world benefit both in terms of health and economy.  reji joseph is an associate professor at institute for studies in industrial development, new delhi; thankom arun is a professor of global development and accountability at the university of essex, u. k.  views are personal

(b.', '1.', '617) as a variant of global concern as it has already spread to more than 40 countries.', 'this underscores the fact that no one is safe until everyone is safe.', 'it calls for globally coordinated efforts to build herd immunity through mass vaccination and to develop new vaccines or tweak the existing ones to become effective against the new variants.', 'experts have been doubtful about the effectiveness of some of the covid-19 vaccines against the new variants of the virus.', 'an immediate outcome of the second wave in india is that many people are no longer hesitant to take the vaccine.', 'however, vaccine shortages have been reported in many parts of the country.', ""several people have criticised the government's vaccine maitri policy."", 'the government has already imposed temporary restrictions on the export of covid-19 vaccines from india.', 'although there is a need for these temporary restrictions to meet domestic demand, any definite move towards vaccine nationalism will be detrimental to global efforts to contain the virus.', 'the pandemic needs to be checked globally in a coordinated manner.', 'if this is not done, the virus will keep mutating and no country will remain isolated.', 'only way to decrease variants of covid-19 is by increasing vaccination, says dr.  gagandeep kang\nfrom may 1, all those aged 18 and above became eligible in india to receive the covid-19 vaccines.', 'this means that 595 million people who require 1,190 million doses were added to the 344 million people in the 45 and above age group requiring 688 million

three vaccines are exclusively used for domestic supply, the anticipated production in the near future will not be sufficient to meet the enormous vaccine demand.', 'being the pharmacy of the world, india needs to rise to the occasion and cater to the demand for vaccines in the country as well as facilitate inoculation of the global population, especially in poorer countries.', 'in the first week

intel will open its factories to outside customers as it shifts strategiesthe ceo of intel, pat gelsinger, has said it could take several years before the current global shortage of semiconductors is resolved. the silicon crunch is the result of several factors that can be tied to the pandemic, beginning with the shuttering of production facilities due to health protocols, coupled with the sudden rise in demand for tech gear, including laptops and tablets as people around the world were forced to work and study remotely due to worldwide lockdowns.  speaking at a virtual session during the computex trade show, gelsinger said he believes it is this ""cycle of explosive growth in [the demand for] semiconductors"" that has placed a huge strain on global supply chains. ""but while the industry has taken steps to address near term constraints it could still take a couple of years for the ecosystem to address shortages of foundry capacity, substrates and components,"" gelsinger added. intel's read of the current chip supply-chain situation isn't any different from that of his peers at dell, cisco, qualcomm, and micron who are equally concerned about the longevity of the crisis. gelsinger however had earlier hinted at turning the crisis into an opportunity to correct an imbalance in the global semiconductor supply chain.  estimates by the us-based semiconductor industry association say around 75% of global manufacturing capacity is in east asia, with taiwan's tsmc and south korea's samsung being the dominant players.  with stakeholders calling for new chip making factories, gelsinger shared that the company has already put into motion plans to invest billions of dollars to not just upgrade its existing facilities in the us, but to also set up new fabrication facilities. via reuterssign up to get breaking news, reviews, opinion, analysis and more, plus the hottest tech deals!thank you for signing up to techradar.  you will receive a verification email shortly. there was a problem.  please refresh the page and try again. techradar is part of future plc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.  visit our corporate site. ©

2021-05-31,"Naftali Bennett: The right-wing tech millionaire who may end Israel's Netanyahu era, Middle East News & Top Stories.","read 3 articles daily and stand to win st rewards, including the st news tablet worth $398. spin the wheel for st read and win now. jerusalem (reuters) naftali bennett, israel's likely next prime minister, is a self-made tech millionaire who dreams of annexing most of the occupied west bank. bennett has said that creation of a palestinian state would be suicide for israel, citing security reasons. but the standard-bearer of israel's religious right and staunch supporter of jewish settlements said on sunday (may 30) he was joining forces with his political opponents to save the country from political disaster. the son of american immigrants, bennett, 49, is a generation younger than 71-year-old prime minister benjamin netanyahu, israel's longest-serving leader. a former commando, bennett named his eldest son after netanyahu's brother, yoni, who was killed in an israeli raid to free hijacked passengers at uganda's entebbe airport in 1976. bennett has had a long and often rocky relationship with netanyahu, working between 2006 and 2008 as a senior aide to the then-opposition leader before leaving on reported bad terms. bennett stormed into national politics in 2013, revamping a pro-settler party and serving as minister of defence as well as of education and the economy in various netanyahu governments. a former leader of yesha, the main settler movement in the west bank, bennett made annexation of parts of the territory that israel captured in a 1967 war a major feature of his political platform. but as head of a so-called government of ""change"" that will include left-wing and centrist parties, while relying on support in parliament from arab legislators, following through on annexation would be politically unfeasible. bennett said on sunday both the right and left would have to compromise on such ideological matters. born in the israeli city of haifa to immigrants from san francisco, bennett is a modern-orthodox religious jew.  he lives with his wife, gilat, a dessert chef, and their four children in the affluent tel aviv suburb of raanana. like netanyahu, bennett speaks fluent american-accented english and spent some of his childhood in north america, where his parents were on sabbatical. while working in the high-tech sector, bennett studied law at jerusalem's hebrew university.  in 1999, he formed a start-up and then moved to new york, eventually selling his anti-fraud software company, cyota, to us security firm rsa for us$145 million in 2005. last year, as netanyahu's government sought to press ahead with west bank annexation and settlement building in the final months of the trump administration, bennett, then defence chief, said: ""the building momentum in the country must not be stopped, even for a second. ""the annexation plan was eventually scrapped when israel formalised ties with the united arab emirates.  analysts see little chance of it being resurrected under donald trump's democratic successor, president joe biden, if ever. nonetheless, palestinians are likely to regard bennett's elevation as a blow to hopes of a negotiated peace and an independent state, the long-standing diplomatic formula that biden favours. after israel in march held its fourth election in two years bennett, who leads the far-right yamina party, said a fifth vote would be a national calamity and entered talks with the centre-left block that forms the main opposition to netanyahu. an advocate of liberalising the economy, bennett has voiced support for cutting government red tape and taxes. unlike some of his former allies on the religious right, bennett is comparatively liberal on issues such as gay rights and the relationship between religion and state in a country where orthodox rabbis wield strong influence. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

""nee soon town council has done a thorough cleaning and disinfection of the common area at block 745 and the surrounding blocks,"" he said. on may 24, the 304 residents of block 559 pasir ris street 51 were asked to go for testing after four covid-19 cases were detected in two households there. the ministry of health said on may 25 that all the tests had come back negative. earlier, moh had identified 11 covid-19 cases from at least four households in block 506 hougang avenue 8.  two of these were detected from a mandatory testing exercise for residents. a total of 405 residents and visitors of the block were tested on may 21 and may 22. responding to a question raised at monday's multi-ministry task force press conference, on the circumstances requiring all residents from a block to be tested, singapore's director of medical services kenneth mak said that when clusters in the domestic setting are picked up, the team will start by looking at the obvious chains of transmission and ""the modes of transmission that are of concern"". ""when we pick up several cases that occur within a fixed geographic vicinity, then we have to be concerned that there may also be chains of transmission that occur to other people that live in that same area,"" said associate professor mak.  ""and this is the reason why we would then extend and carry out testing operations. ""these testing operations are also reinforced by looking at data from other testing modalities, such as wastewater testing. screening wastewater samples could complement clinical testing and provide an additional indicator to assess the level of covid-19 spread within a community.  this is because infected individuals, including those who have mild symptoms or are asymptomatic could still be shedding the virus in their stool. assoc prof mak noted that this may raise concerns as it could suggest that there are additional people who may be asymptomatic but are potentially infectious to others, creating a sense of urgency to launch testing operations at the respective housing blocks. ""so we look at each cluster on a case-by-case basis, looking at the circumstances and making that decision (on) whether we want to organise these testing operations,"" he said. though such operations are not easy to carry out, assoc prof mak noted that they are necessary as part of singapore's aggressive testing to stay ahead of the curve and prevent further infections in the community. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-05-31,Canada mourns 215 children after remains found at indigenous school.,"montreal: canada flew its flags at half-mast on sunday (may 30) in mourning for215 children whose remains were discoveredon the grounds of a former boarding school set up more than a century ago to assimilate indigenous peoples. ""to honour the 215 children whose lives were taken at the former kamloops residential school and all indigenous children who never made it home, the survivors, and their families, i have asked that the peace tower flag (in ottawa) and flags on all federal buildings be flown at half-mast,"" prime minister justin trudeau said on twitter. several municipalities, including the economic metropolis toronto, announced they would also lower their flags. the discovery of the children's remains, some as young as three, sparked strong emotions throughout canada, particularly in the indigenous communities. a specialist used ground-penetrating radar to confirm the remains of the students who attended the school near kamloops, british columbia, the tk'emlups te secwepemc tribe said in a statement late thursday. the kamloops indian residential school was the largest of 139 boarding schools set up in the late 19th century, with up to 500 students registered and attending at any one time. it was operated by the catholic church on behalf of the canadian government from 1890 to 1969. some 150,000 indian, inuit and metis youngsters in total were forcibly enrolled in these schools, where students were physically and sexually abused by headmasters and teachers who stripped them of their culture and language. today those experiences are blamed for a high incidence of poverty, alcoholism and domestic violence, as well as high suicide rates, in their communities. ottawa formally apologised in 2008 for what the commission later termed a ""cultural genocide"" as part of a c$1. 9 billion (us$1. 6 billion) settlement with former students. ""i've said before that the residential schools was a genocide of our people.  here's just another glowing example of that genocide in practice: undocumented deaths of children,"" the national chief of the assembly of first nations, perry bellegarde, said sunday on the news channel ctv. bellegarde noted there was still much work to be done to identify the remains, find their families and examine the sites of other residential schools. he said the federal government ""does have a responsibility to make sure that these resources are in place to get the answers. ""ceremonies to honor the young victims took place or were to take place throughout the country.  about 100 people gathered sunday in the mohawk community of kahnawake, near montreal. participants placed children's shoes and toys on the steps of the saint francis xavier church as a tribute to the victims. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

(sph). he is considered the best man for the job.  they would have us believe that it has nothing to do with the fact that khaw is a former heavyweight minister and former chairman of the people's action party (pap). the current chairman of sph is lee boon yang, yet another former minister. he succeeded tony tan, a former minister who stepped down as chairman of sph to contest in the presidential election. and before tony tan, who was the sph chairman? s.  r.  nathan, who also became president after his stint as sph chairman. sph as a breeding ground for the presidency?now, is there any wonder why sph has been mired in such massive challenges that calls for an urgent restructuring? the company has been led by people with deep-seated links to the ruling pap government, and with entirely no media experience. the same goes for the current sph ceo, ng yat chung, a former army general with absolutely no media experience.  he succeeded alan chan, a civil servant for decades, and a former principal private secretary to the late lee kuan yew. the current president, mdm halimah yacob, did not serve as sph chairman.  but she too is a former political appointee as speaker of parliament, who was considered the best person for the job of president. indeed, no one was good enough to even compete against her in the walkover presidential election because no certificate of eligibility was issued to anyone else. but, there is one former pap guy who is not considered the best man for anything – dr tan cheng bock.  not since dr tan contested the presidential election against the pap candidate tony tan.  and definitely not since dr tan started his own political party. they say dr tan has lost his way.  the truth is, for the pap, it is their way or the highway. when

2021-05-31,"Uncovered: Employers found illegally holding on to their domestic workers' passports and work permits, Singapore News.","singapore a new initiative to pay random visits to employers and their foreign domestic workers has uncovered some instances of employers illegally holding on to their workers' passports and work permits. the ministry of manpower (mom) has made 200 such checks since last month. domestic workers and migrant welfare groups told the straits times (st) that the new measures, which include conducting more in-person interviews with maids, would help ensure decent living and working arrangements for them. advocacy groups, however, said that mandating proper conditions would be even better. in response to queries from st, an mom spokesman said: ""thus far, employers have been supportive and allowed our officers to interview their migrant domestic workers (mdws). ""the initiative comes on the heels of a few cases where domestic helpers were badly abused.  in february, housewife gaiyathiri murugayan admitted to starving and torturing myanmar maid piang ngaih don, 24, leading to her death. as at december last year, 247,000 work permits had been issued for foreign domestic workers, the mom spokesman added. mom also said its officers are trained to look out for signs of abuse and pick up cues of stress and anxiety while speaking to domestic helpers.  each house visit typically lasts 20 minutes. [[nid:467235]]in-person interviews with workers are done by the centre for domestic employees (cde), an initiative of the national trades union congress. since late 2017, the centre has interviewed an average of 2,000 randomly selected domestic workers a month, and it aims to expand the interviews to cover all first-time migrant domestic workers by the year end. due to the covid-19 pandemic, the cde currently conducts interviews by video. cde executive director shamsul kamar said: ""common areas of concern raised by a small number of migrant domestic workers include insufficient rest and food; having their personal documents such as passports, work permits, contract being withheld from them; unsafe work environment, methods; or illegal deployment and salary issues.  these cases are reported to mom for further investigation. ""mr shamsul added that cde reports cases where domestic helpers are physically harmed by their employer to the police immediately. indonesian domestic helper nelvin ganaga said she is happy to hear of mom's new initiative. she said it is important for mom to ensure that domestic workers have sufficient time and space to talk to their families and make friends in singapore. [[nid:435412]]the 39-year-old experienced abuse with a former employer in 2015.  the employer's daughter and mother would step on ms ganaga when she slept at night and even spat in her food once. the seven-year-old child would also pinch ms ganaga until she was bruised and continued to do so even after being scolded by ms ganaga's employer. although ms ganaga asked to return to her agency, her employer refused and sent her back to jakarta instead.  ms ganaga then spent a month in batam before coming back to singapore, but it meant she had to pay new agency fees all over again to work here. ms ganaga began working in 2016 for her current employer, with whom she has a good relationship.  she treats the family's children like her own, she said. employers who spoke to st said they support the house visits as that is one way to ensure domestic helpers are being treated fairly. ms ganaga's current employer, ms lau joon-nie, 50, said: ""it's a step in the right direction to check on mdws' well-being and mental health, given that it's been a tough year for everyone and those of them who were due for home leave would not have been able to return. ""[[nid:482467]]added ms lau, director of a non-profit organisation that focuses on the media industry: ""helpers are not mind readers, nor did they grow up in the environment we did, so they cannot be assumed to know what we expect from them.  it helps to ask oneself: how would you want your employer to treat you if you were in their shoes?"" local migrant welfare groups said more can be done to support foreign domestic workers here. the former president of transient workers count too (twc2), mr john gee, listed equipping each domestic helper with a mobile phone, easing their terms for transfer and giving them access to an employer's past record on hired help as other steps that can be implemented. he also said the authorities should look into ensuring helpers have a mandatory day off each week which cannot be negotiated away for payment. ""a worker who goes out freely can seek advice from other workers, non-governmental organisations, her agents or mom and could leave her employers if she felt desperate enough.  in such cases, potential abusers might well think twice before acting, and workers could act in their own defence before any abuse escalated,"" he said. this article was first published in the straits times.  permission required for reproduction.

2021-05-31,People who want alternative COVID-19 vaccines can get them under special access route.,"singapore: people who cannot take the two covid-19 vaccines currently authorised in singapore will soon have access to other vaccines, said the ministry of health (moh) on monday (may 31). it will allow access to these vaccines under the special access route – an existing process for the import and supply of unregistered medicines to address unmet medical needs. currently, singapore residents can get vaccinated with either the pfizer-biontech or moderna vaccines – both mrna vaccines – under its national inoculation programme. ""there has been interest to access alternate vaccines used in other countries, mostly due to various medical reasons which prevent individuals from taking the two authorised vaccines in singapore,"" said moh.  ""however, there have either been no applications for approval of these alternate vaccines in singapore, or evaluation is still ongoing. ""the mrna vaccines are not suitable for those who have had severe allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis and for immunocompromised people.  the pfizer-biontech vaccine is being administered to singapore residents aged 12 and above and the moderna vaccine to those aged 18 and above. however, health minister ong ye kung said on monday that after an extensive review, more people will be able to get the mrna vaccines.  these include pregnant or breastfeeding women, cancer patients receiving treatment and those with severe cutaneous adverse reactions, such as drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome and stevens-johnson syndrome. ""the expert committee is also examining the data and reviewing the current policy where we restrict individuals with known anaphylaxis, to take the vaccine,"" said mr ong. ""specifically, the committee is reviewing the restriction for those who are not allergic to the mrna vaccine or its components, but other substances like seafood, painkillers, antibiotics. ""there are more than 30,000 people in this group, he said.  while the review will allow more people from this group to be inoculated, moh will also allow them to use some other vaccines to provide more flexibility, he said. the ministry will allow the special access route to be used for the supply of covid-19 vaccines that are on the world health organization's (who) emergency use listing, it said. these vaccines include those by johnson & johnson, astrazeneca and sinopharm. ""as and when the who approves the sinovac vaccine into its emergency use list, the licensed healthcare institution can apply to moh to draw on our existing stock of 200,000 doses to administer to those who wish to have it,"" said mr ong. the use of such vaccines should be according to who guidelines and will be time-limited for the duration of the pandemic, said moh.  this avenue will be made available through the private healthcare sector, it said. ""like all other medicines supplied under the special access route, the doctor administering the vaccine and the patient should discuss the risks and benefits of using vaccines not registered or authorised by the health sciences authority, and jointly make an informed decision,"" said moh. those who opt for these vaccines will also have to sign a consent form to acknowledge that they have discussed with their doctor and accept all responsibility for the risks. the government will not subsidise these vaccines, and people who receive these jabs will not be eligible for its financial assistance programme for vaccine injuries. as more data becomes available, moh will be able to determine if people vaccinated under the special access route may be eligible for the same exemptions on testing or public health restrictions, which may be extended to those vaccinated under the national programme, said the ministry. downloadour appor subscribe to our telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:https://cna. asia/telegramit looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-05-31,FAQ: What you need to know about the COVID-19 vaccination exercise for students.,"singapore: singapore is expanding its national covid-19 vaccination programme to include students, with registrations for more than 400,000 schoolchildren aged 12 and above to open on tuesday (jun 1). theannouncement, made by prime minister lee hsien loong in a televised speech on monday, comes after the pfizer-biontech vaccine was approved by the health sciences authority for those aged 12 to 15 earlier this month. the exercise will begin with graduating cohorts from secondary schools and at the pre-university levels, said the ministry of education (moe) in a separate press release.  slots will be available from jun 3. here are some frequently asked questions about the vaccination exercise for students and how they can get their jab. q: how do i register for the vaccine for myself or my child?a: eligible students aged 18 and above as well as parents of children below 18 will progressively receive smses with a unique registration link, said the education ministry. graduating cohorts from secondary schools and at the pre-university levels in particular, students sitting for the gce n-, o- or a-level examinations later this year will be the first to receive the vaccination invitation. over the next two weeks, the remaining full-time students in schools and institutes of higher learning will receive their invitations to register for the vaccine, said the education ministry. this includes privately-funded schools, madrasahs and special education schools, said moe in the press release.  privately-funded schools comprise anglo-chinese school (international), st joseph's institution international high school and hwa chong international school. parents of students in graduating cohorts who do not receive the sms by jun 3 should contact their children's school for assistance. ""schools will also be reaching out to parents of students in mainstream primary and secondary schools separately with additional details on their vaccinations.  in general, students who are in schools and the institutes of higher learning should receive their smses by the end of the second week of june,"" said moe in a factsheet. sms invites will only be sent to parents or guardians of children who are 12 years old as of jun 1.  students whose 12th birthday fall after jun 1 will be invited for their vaccination at a later date, said moe. q: can i choose which vaccine i want to take?a: students below 18 will only be offered the pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccine, while those aged 18 and above can opt for either vaccine from pfizer-biontech or moderna, said the education ministry. for both vaccines, the interval between the first and second dose will be six to eight weeks. q: where can i get vaccinated?a: eligible students can get their jabs at community vaccination centres.  there will also be four dedicated moe vaccination centres set up at raffles city convention centre, ite college central, ite college east and ite college west, said moe. ite will arrange for their students to take their vaccinations on campus. each ite centre will have up to 1,600 vaccination slots per day, ""comparable"" to community vaccination centres, while raffles convention centre can take up to 2,000 slots per day, said moe in a briefing on monday. the ministry will also deploy mobile vaccination teams to special education schools to ""facilitate access"" for eligible students who may find it challenging to visit a vaccination centre. q: will parents be allowed to accompany their child to the vaccination centre?a: parents are required to accompany their child to the vaccination centre if they are below 13 years old. parents of students aged 13 and above are not required to be present.  should they choose to do so, however, they will be asked to wait at a family area outside the vaccination room to avoid congestion and ensure compliance with safe management measures. students in special education schools must also be accompanied by a parent or guardian. parental or guardian consent is also required for students below 18, as part of the booking process for the vaccination slots through the national appointment system, said moe.  consent given via the system will be collected once, and will apply for both doses of the vaccine. q: what happens if i miss my vaccination appointment? will i be allowed to make another appointment?a: students who miss their first vaccination appointment during the moe vaccination exercise will be able to reschedule when the vaccination is open to the public for their age bands, said the ministry in the factsheet. if students miss their second vaccination appointment, they should contact moh at 1800 333 9999 for further assistance. q: what if my vaccination appointment clashes with my upcoming oral national examinations?a: if students' upcoming oral national examination schedules clash with their appointment dates for the first or second dose of their vaccination, changes to their oral examination dates within the examination window can be accommodated where possible, said the education ministry. new appointment dates for the vaccination can also be scheduled. special consideration may be applicable if rescheduling is not possible, and parents or students should provide evidence of the vaccination appointment to facilitate this, said moe. downloadour appor subscribe to our telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:https://cna. asia/telegramit looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

""while the bankers would be bound by strict rules, including only being allowed to visit pre-approved places listed on the itinerary, the announcement has raised eyebrows among the public questioning the fairness of the exemption. fully vaccinated individuals arriving in hong kong still have to undergo quarantine at a designated hotel, albeit a shorter one: 14 days in the hotel and the remaining seven self-monitoring at home. no other professions or groups have been exempted from the quarantine policy. according to the financial times, hong kong's ""expat finance community"" voiced ""deep concerns"" about the city's strict policies when a gym cluster in march sent hundreds—including expats working at top financial institutions—packing and into government quarantine facilities.  follow coconuts on instagram and twitter for more fresh and juicy news in your feeds.

2021-05-31,"Woman slapped 8-year-old girl who stepped on her foot in MRT train, left her with bruise."," jean iauthe straits timesmay 28, 2021a woman admitted on friday (may 28) to slapping the face of a then eight-year-old girl in an mrt train. she wanted to stop the girl from leaving the train without apologising for having stepped on her foot. but the girl had apologised to connie soh, 45, who was talking loudly on her phone at the time and did not hear the apology. on friday, soh pleaded guilty to one charge of voluntarily causing hurt.  she faces enhanced penalties as the victim is under 14 years old. the court heard that on july 15 last year, some time before 1. 47pm, the victim accidentally stepped on soh's left foot after boarding the mrt train with her mother at choa chu kang station. she apologised to soh, who was talking loudly on her phone at the time and did not hear the apology. soh confronted the victim's mother and asked her why the girl did not apologise for stepping on her foot. but the mother told soh that her daughter had apologised, and an argument ensued. when the train reached yew tee station and the girl and her mother proceeded to exit the train carriage, soh slapped the girl on her left cheek to try to prevent her from leaving without apologising. the girl started to cry, and her mother called the police from the station soon after. later that day, the mother took her daughter to national university hospital, where a doctor noted that the girl had sustained a left cheek contusion, or bruise. she was given a two-day medical certificate, with excuse from physical activity until july 19 that year. deputy public prosecutor joseph gwee urged the court to sentence soh to a fine of at least $5,000, calling soh's response ""(an) objectively disproportionate one (that was) committed in a public place"". soh is scheduled for sentencing on june 18.  one other charge of using criminal force to poke the nose of the girl's mother will be taken into account during sentencing. for voluntarily causing hurt, an offender can be jailed for up to three years, fined up to $5,000, or both. soh faces double this maximum penalty as the girl was under 14. get a copy of the straits times or go to straitstimes. com for more stories. get more of stomp's latest updates by following us on facebook, whatsapp, twitter, instagram and youtube. view the discussion thread. view the discussion thread. download the new stomp app today. sph digital news | the straits timesall rights reserved | terms & conditions | data protection policy | advertise with ussph digital news / stomp / copyright (c) 2019 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.

2021-05-31,Taiwan signs local deals for up to 20 million COVID shots.,"taipei (reuters) -taiwan's government has signed deals with two local companies to provide up to 20 million doses of their covid-19 vaccines, the official central news agency said on sunday, in a boost to the island's pandemic fight. the news comes days after the chinese-claimed island blamed beijing week for blocking a deal earlier this year for biontech se vaccines, which china denies. after recording just a handful of daily infections for months, taiwan is dealing with relatively large numbers of community transmissions, though infection rates are starting to fall. it has only vaccinated around 1% of its more than 23 million people but has almost 30 million shots on order, from astrazeneca plc, moderna inc and two domestic firms. the central news agency said the government had on friday signed deals with medigen vaccine biologics corp and united biomedical inc for five million doses each, and had oral agreements for another five million each, for a total of 20 million shots. medigen confirmed the details in a statement to the stock exchange while the government's central epidemic command centre said it would issue a statement later.  united biomedical did not immediately respond to a request for comment. however, neither shot has yet been formally approved for use and both are still undergoing tests, which taiwan's government says are going well. earlier on sunday, health minister chen shih-chung said taiwan has not given up hope of eventually getting covid-19 vaccines from germany's biontech. shanghai fosun pharmaceutical group co has a contract with biontech to sell the vaccines in greater china, including to taiwan, but taiwan's government says it will only deal with germany's biontech directly and does not trust vaccines from china. outside of greater china, biontech has partnered with pfizer inc. . taiwan is under its second-highest level of curbs to stop the spread of infections, including limiting personal gatherings and closing entertainment venues. chen said the task was to ensure those measures were being properly enforced, adding, ""at present there are no plans or intentions for a lockdown. ""taiwan reported 355 domestic covid-19 cases on sunday, down from 486 on saturday.  total daily cases peaked on may 17 and have been falling since friday.

2021-05-31,"Covid-19 lockdown lessons from the US: Sharper, rigorous curbs lead to better outcomes, United States News & Top Stories.","read 3 articles daily and stand to win st rewards, including the st news tablet worth $398. spin the wheel for st read and win now. washington as covid-19 cases rise across south-east and north-east asia, this time in some countries and cities in the form of faster-spreading variants, the livelihoods of hundreds of millions hang on whether there should be a lockdown, and to what degree. by and large, the classic policy response to outbreaks has been lockdowns. but lockdowns last year, while succeeding in lowering infections, contributed considerably to the global recession. yet lockdowns alone are not to blame for the recession, which was also driven by people voluntarily refraining from social interactions as they feared contracting the virus, the international monetary fund (imf) noted last october. ""therefore, lifting lockdowns is unlikely to lead to a decisive and sustained economic boost if infections are still elevated, as voluntary social distancing will likely persist,"" the imf said. lockdowns work only if they are well-timed, targeted and airtight.  when they are all of the above, they do strangle economic growth, but they also stop the spread of the virus which ultimately is good for economic growth. ""lockdowns are a blunt instrument,"" says dr gautam menon, a professor of physics and biology at ashoka university in india.  ""they are an invaluable part of the armoury.  but they should be used as locally as possible, if they must be. ""in early 2020, much of the world resorted to sweeping lockdowns.  life came to a near standstill. but lockdowns varied according to the particular circumstances of every country or city. in india, in late march last year, a nationwide lockdown was too much too soon, and the economic fallout was so bad that india could not repeat a national lockdown later, when it was arguably needed more.  instead, earlier this year, amid misplaced triumphalism, political rallies and religious gatherings were allowed with predictably catastrophic results. in the united states, there was no national lockdown; states were left to their own devices and imposed varying versions of lockdowns, many of them too late and undermined by weaknesses, from ambiguous public messaging to cultural resistance.  thanks to this, it was the us that suffered the world's worst death toll last year. the research is clear: covid-19 restrictions work to break the chain of infection, with timely, sharper restrictions having greater effect than slower, weaker ones. the global lockdown rush last year came amid varying epidemiological situations, and while some countries locked down too late, others did so too soon. ""we now have definitive proof here in the us that rigorous lockdowns have been associated with far less severe outbreaks, lower death counts and more rapid recovery,"" science writer and analyst laurie garrett told the sunday times.  ""in addition, vaccine acceptance has run higher in states that paid a big price with lockdowns the population is eager to get back to fun, family and offices. ""but lockdowns are economically painful ""and severely so for the poorest, lowest-skilled labourers"", ms garrett said.  ""without careful government intervention, lockdowns exacerbate discrimination, and widen gaps in relative wealth and access to such basics as food and housing.  immigrants and minority groups are particularly vulnerable. ""in addition, prolonged lockdowns have had other adverse health effects.  they hamper routine medical and dental exams, and contribute to alcohol and drug abuse and domestic violence. for people employed in daily wage work, who because of the nature of the job cannot work from home, the covid-19 recession has been a catastrophe. towards the end of last year, several countries, including vietnam, thailand and singapore, appeared to have done a lot right, with local spread of the disease limited.  yet now, covid-19 cases are back up. oxford university's blavatnik school of government maintains what is probably the world's largest database tracking government responses to the pandemic.  in a march blog post before the current wave hit south-east asia, dr thomas hale noted that success and failure are moving targets. ""some governments were able to contain the first wave and then preserve those gains with a mix of targeted closure and containment measures, extensive testing and contact tracing, and firm international border controls,"" he wrote. ""places like china, taiwan, vietnam and new zealand all managed not just to flatten the curve but to keep it flat, albeit with a few small flare-ups. ""in an interview, dr hale told the sunday times that south-east and north-east asian countries and cities seeing a surge are still in a relatively good position. ""you can have a very good defence, but then eventually this is a random process.  so, some person spread some disease to some other person and it gets a little bit out of control and it misses the testing. . .  and then you have an outbreak,"" he said. ""we don't know exactly, but it seems like many of these recent outbreaks are potentially two new variants that are more contagious.  so what worked before may not work against these new variants.  and that's part of the very dynamic nature of this. ""dr hale added: ""to my mind, the lockdown is a solution you might need, but really only if your test-and-trace system fails in the first instance. ""in countries such as australia, china and new zealand, the test-and-trace system has been really good at preventing outbreaks from getting out of control, ""but even the best ones will, at some point, fail and then they'll need some sort of lockdown, hopefully very short, fast, localised"". dr hale compared lockdowns to how you might need to amputate a limb to stop an infection.  it is a costly policy, and you can do it only so many times. ""and so ideally, you would do it when it's so small that you can do that amputation with the scalpel really to jump on it very quickly before it spreads,"" he said.  ""if, however, the infection has already spread very far. . .  you need a more serious amputation.  and that's where, unfortunately, many countries have found themselves. ""an aggressive vaccination programme is the key, ms garrett stressed.  in its absence, only two non-pharmaceutical interventions make a significant dent in slowing covid-19: consistent and proper mask-wearing, and stringent social distancing. dr menon added: ""it would be best if nations turned their attention to vaccinating as many as they can and as fast as they can.  they can then avoid the economic consequences and uncertainties associated with a lockdown.

2021-05-31,Naomi Osaka's sister sheds light on media boycott.,"hours after naomi osaka was fined $15,000 and warned of stiffer consequences for shirking french open media responsibilities, her older sister shed light on what prompted the tennis phenom's press boycott.  mari osaka posted a message on reddit sunday afternoon explaining that naomi's refusal to speak with media started with criticism over her performance on clay surfaces.  mari, a retired tennis player, deleted the post after it gained traction on social media, but not before the new york times verified with naomi osaka's team that it was written by mari. ""naomi mentioned to me before the tournament that a family member had come up to her and remarked that she's bad at clay,"" mari wrote.  ""at every press conference she's told she's had a bad record on clay.  when she lost in rome r1 she was not ok mentally. ""her confidence was completely shattered and i think that everyone's remarks and opinions have gotten to her head and she herself believed that she was bad on clay. ""osaka won her opening-round match at the french open on sunday against patricia maria tig in straight sets.  after the match, she skipped her media obligations as she wrote that she would in a statement last week, citing mental health concerns.  mari wrote that naomi's refusal to speak with media was a form of ""protecting her mind. """"so her solution was to block everything out,"" mari continued.  ""no talking to people who is (sic) going to put doubt in her mind.  she's protecting her mind hence why it's called mental health. ""mari inaccurately wrote in her reddit post that ""tennis players don't get paid to do press conferences. "" sunday's fine statement signed by the lead executives from each of tennis' four grand slams reminded osaka that meeting with media is a ""contractual obligation"" and warned of more significant consequences moving forward, including potential suspension from grand slam play. ""we have advised naomi osaka that should she continue to ignore her media obligations during the tournament, she would be exposing herself to possible further code of conduct infringement consequences.  ""as might be expected, repeat violations attract tougher sanctions including default from the tournament (code of conduct article iii t. ) and the trigger of a major offense investigation that could lead to more substantial fines and future grand slam suspensions (code of conduct article iv a. 3. ). ""according to the statement, osaka didn't respond when tournament organizers reached ""to check on her well-being and offer support. "" tournament organizers described media obligations as a ""core element of the grand slam regulations"" and wrote that osaka skipping hers provides an unfair competitive advantage.  ""as a sport there is nothing more important than ensuring no player has an unfair advantage over another, which unfortunately is the case in this situation if one player refuses to dedicate time to participate in media commitments while the others all honour their commitments,"" the statement continued. osaka, ranked no.  2 in the world, will take on romania's ana bogdan in round 2 on wednesday, where she opened as a -350 betting favorite.  the tennis world will be focused on osaka during and after the match.  more from yahoo sports:tony parker qualifies for world series of poker main eventbushnell: olympians must sign waiver to compete in tokyorafael nadal, other tennis stars react to naomi osakahaynes: how lakers have operated after hitting vaccine thresholdsri lanka launched a criminal probe on sunday into a massive container ship fire that has swamped the island nation's coast with plastic pollution in an unprecedented marine disaster. tonnes of microplastic granules have inundated the south asian country's famed beaches, forcing a fishing ban and prompting fears of ecological damage. the ministry of health (moh) on sunday (30 may) confirmed the detection of 25 new cases of covid-19 infection in singapore, taking the country's total case count to 62,028. 《!》ut,!british prime minister boris johnson married his fiancee carrie symonds in a ""secret ceremony"" on saturday, uk media reports said. whilst the typical homeownership journey for most singaporeans is 'upgrading' from an hdb flat to a private property (e. g.   homeowners who need more space for their growing families might move from their smaller condo to a larger hdb flat.   on the other hand, an older couple may also choose to move into a smaller hdb flat once their children have moved out. a 51-year-old woman recovering from a brain tumour died after consuming traditional chinese medicine (tcm) which likely caused her acute liver failure, the state coroner found. smart,5%!$1,600,!the remote pacific nation of palau reported its first confirmed coronavirus case monday, but authorities said it was historical and posed no transmission risk. singapore residents will soon be able to purchase ""do-it-yourself"" covid-19 tests over the counter at pharmacies, said prime minister lee hsien loong on monday (31 may). from tuesday (1 june), 400,000 students from schools and ihls can register for the covid-19 vaccine. ???,. ,,,. israeli and egyptian officials held talks in both countries sunday aimed at bolstering the cairo-brokered ceasefire that ended the latest deadly flare-up of violence between the jewish state and gaza's hamas rulers. he risked everything to give his baby girl a second chance at life this article, cannabis can mean death in malaysia.  for one dad, it also meant life for his daughter. , originally appeared on coconuts, asia's leading alternative media company. gavin macleod, a veteran supporting actor best known for his role as an ever-smiling cruise ship captain on the 1970s-80s sitcom ""the love boat,"" died saturday at the age of 90. $6,600「」,$100「」to enhance singapore's overall vaccine coverage and offer more flexibility, the government will allow private healthcare providers here to import and administer alternative covid-19 vaccines via special access routes (sars). hdb resale flats are a great alternative for those who can't wait years for a bto.  compare hdb resale flat prices and trends in this comprehensive guide to resale flats in singapore. israeli opposition leader yair lapid on monday said many obstacles remain before a diverse coalition can be built to oust veteran prime minister benjamin netanyahu but voiced hope it will achieve the ""greater goal"". all asset classes.  industry-leading prices.  user-friendly investing online. polish police said monday they were investigating a fake bomb threat that forced a ryanair passenger plane travelling from dublin to krakow to make an emergency landing in berlin. prime minister lee hsien loong appeared in court via video conferencing on monday (31 may) in a defamation suit against a writer from the online citizen, rubaashini who was absent from the hearing. brazil's president jair bolsonaro promised the yanomami indigenous people in remarks released sunday that there will be no mining on their land unless they want it. ,!

""the health ministry has warned of possible scenarios in which doctors would have to make the difficult choice to prioritise icu beds for patients with a high recovery potential over patients with low recovery potential (poor prognosis). ""this is a difficult situation that we are all facing and the health ministry would like to call on all parties to work together,"" he said in a joint press conference with senior minister (security) datuk seri ismail sabri yaakob. dr noor hisham said the numbers of available beds in icus, covid-19 hospitals, as well as quarantine and treatment centres, were declining because of rapidly rising cases. the usage of icu beds for covid-19 patients was now at 104 per cent capacity, with 1,113 beds in use, while covid-19 hospital beds have reached 85 per cent capacity, with 10,190 patients currently hospitalised. as for covid-19 quarantine and treatment centres, beds were now at 65 per cent capacity, with 27,183 beds in use while ventilators were at 60 per cent, with 2,138 total being used, of which 39 per cent were for covid-19 patients. he added that the health ministry has taken the initiative to increase the number of beds in covid-19 hospitals and covid-19 hybrid hospitals by repurposing certain spaces in the hospitals into icu units. ""the kepala batas hospital field icu, as well as the proposed temporary takeover of the ukm children's hospital, are also among the steps we are taking to increase icu capacity. ""we are also collaborating with ngos that are offering medical assistance to open more icus in areas that need them,"" he said, adding that the lack of manpower is posing a major challenge to the ministry. dr noor hisham also said the health ministry has increased the quarantine period for travellers arriving from overseas. the quarantine period for five high-risk countries such as india, pakistan, sri lanka, nepal and bangladesh has been extended to 21 days. he also said malaysia might be able to flatten the covid-19 curve in three to four months, but this will require cooperation from the public to adhere to the standard operating procedures. an accelerated vaccination drive would also be vital to slow the infection curve. he said with the rise of new variants of concern (voc), the two-week total lockdown starting tuesday was necessary to reduce the number of cases and give front-liners much needed breathing room. adding to concerns, he said the health ministry had recently received information from vietnam about a new voc detected there, a hybrid of the variants first identified in britain and india. ""the new variants are concerning as they cause more infections and deaths. ""we must ramp up vaccinations and in june, we will be able to use over 10 million doses, this is necessary for us to do.

2021-05-31,"New rule on Covid-19 test for returning S'poreans, PRs not a straightforward matter, say experts, Singapore News & Top Stories.","read 3 articles daily and stand to win st rewards, including the st news tablet worth $398. spin the wheel for st read and win now. singapore a new requirement that singapore citizens and permanent residents (prs) must test negative for covid-19 before being allowed to return home from high-risk countries kicked in at midnight on sunday (may 30). infectious diseases experts say the move will help to protect front-line staff at the airport and could help to ease the load on singapore's healthcare system, which has had to deal with a spike in community cases in recent weeks. but they also note that the measure has its limitations and implementing it is not as straightforward as it seems.  at least one legal expert has raised the issue of the constitutionality of the new requirement with the government. the ministry of health (moh) said last wednesday that, from 11. 59pm on saturday, all singaporeans and prs returning to the country will have to present a valid negative covid-19 polymerase chain reaction (pcr) test taken within 72 hours before their departure. this is the first time moh has required singaporeans and prs to take a pre-departure test. the ministry had previously said it did not want to make it difficult for them to return home, should they be caught unprepared by rapidly deteriorating pandemic conditions abroad. the immigration and checkpoints authority's (ica) safetravel website says those travelling by plane or by boat will have to present their test result at the air and sea checkpoints upon arrival in singapore. those who have stayed in lower-risk areas, including australia, brunei, china, hong kong, macau and new zealand, for the last 21 days are exempted. children aged six and below are also exempted from the new requirement. at land checkpoints, only prs entering singapore will need to present a valid negative test result. prs who arrive in singapore overland without a valid negative test result may be denied entry.  those who fail to comply with the new requirement may have their entry or re-entry permit cancelled. travellers must be tested by an accredited or authorised health centre in the country or region of departure. documentary proof is required and ica recommends that travellers ask for a copy of the pcr test report that is in english or accompanied by an english translation, contains the traveller's name, date of birth and passport number, and shows the date and result of the test. mr fin chua, 30, who has been living in thailand for eight years, planned to fly back to singapore next week to visit his father, who lives alone. after hearing about the pre-departure test requirement, the business owner considered moving his flight earlier so he could return before the measure kicked in. ultimately, mr chua did not do so.  instead, he moved his flight back by two weeks to mid-june, citing the lengthy 21-day stay-home notice he would have to serve if he came back home now. mr chua feels that the new requirement is onerous as it is not easy getting a covid-19 pcr test in bangkok . he said a pcr test in the thai capital costs about 2,000 baht (s$85) at a government clinic and 4,000 baht at a government hospital, but it is hard for foreigners to get tested as thais get priority. the wait to get tested at the clinics can take hours, he said, unless one pays more to join a priority queue, which means a wait time of 15 to 30 minutes.

ms cheryl wong, 30, who works in the film industry in new york, said she did not mind the new requirement as getting tested for covid-19 in the us city is easy and there are free services. ""if i lived somewhere else with fewer testing options and undetermined turnaround times, i'd probably be more annoyed,"" added ms wong, who is returning home on may 31 to renew her us work visa and to see her family after being away for 11⁄2 years. she noted, though, that the new test requirement did not appear to take into account singaporeans or prs who had already been vaccinated, or that individuals may still test positive even though they may no longer be infectious. she said: ""i'm pretty sure i'll test negative because i'm fully vaccinated and i am still cautious.  but there is that little bit of a 'what if'. ""mr samuel phua, 23, who is coming home next month after graduating from the sibelius academy in finland, is also somewhat anxious about the pre-departure test. ""it is allergy season here, and pollen allergies and covid-19 have symptoms that are quite similar.  i got myself tested recently and my results were negative, but there's always that sliver of doubt and worry that the next one may be positive. ""but mr phua also said that the new requirement is an important step towards ensuring the safety of singaporeans both abroad and back home. dr ling li min, an infectious disease physician from rophi clinic, said the decision to require citizens and prs to take pre-departure tests before they are allowed entry would have been a difficult one for the authorities to make. limited access to swab testing facilities in some countries means that singaporeans living in places where covid-19 is raging may not be able to return home. but with the recent spate of unlinked community cases, dr ling said, the authorities now have several fires to fight and the new testing requirement will help to minimise the risk of the virus spreading in singapore. this is especially in the light of the fact that the changi airport cluster singapore's largest active cluster with more than 100 cases was traced to staff interactions with a family who flew in from south asia. while dr ling acknowledged that pcr tests may not pick up every single case, she said the mandatory pre-departure tests will at least help to identify those who are infectious and prevent the virus from spreading on board flights into singapore. she added: ""it is evident that a key vulnerability exists from when passengers disembark until they are taken to their stay-home notice facility.  this measure would further reduce the potential exposure to the virus for that part of the journey. ""professor paul tambyah, deputy director of the national university of singapore (nus) yong loo lin school of medicine's infectious diseases translational research programme, also said the new measure would protect changi airport staff. ""if this screening reduces the number of infected people passing through the airport even by a small proportion, it might reduce the risk to staff in particular to those who, for some reason or another, cannot take the vaccines,"" he said. asked if the authorities should also extend the pre-departure test requirement to singaporeans and prs returning from lower-risk places, prof tambyah said it would be logical to mandate the test for everyone. ""taiwan and vietnam were previously considered low-risk places, as was the state of victoria in australia.  these classifications can change rapidly,"" he added.

professor teo yik ying, dean of nus' saw swee hock school of public health, said implementing the new requirement may be more challenging than anticipated. echoing a point made by prof tambyah, prof teo said not every jurisdiction will have commercial pcr testing capacity that is accredited and trustworthy. hence, there is a need to ensure that singaporeans and prs who intend to travel to singapore are able to access proper testing. otherwise, the testing requirement could be additional logistical hurdles for those returning as they would have to transit in cities where these tests are available, prof teo said. he added: ""it will not be useful if returning travellers simply pay for a substandard test or a forged negative pcr test certificate. ""there is also the issue of the government's responsibility towards citizens who test positive and cannot return home on a commercial flight. moh said travellers who test positive on their pre-departure test should seek medical care and ensure that they have fully recovered and are non-infectious before travelling to singapore. singaporeans who test positive for covid-19 while overseas and require urgent medical care can still return home via a medical evacuation flight or any other equivalent form of transport. singapore management university assistant professor of law benjamin joshua ong noted that article 13(1) of the singapore constitution states that no citizen of singapore shall be ""banished or excluded"" from singapore. the courts have not ruled on the precise meaning of the words ""banished"" or ""excluded"", he said. ""it is possible that those words mean that anything preventing a citizen of singapore from travelling to singapore would be unconstitutional.  on the other hand, a court might also hold that it is acceptable for certain requirements to be imposed on citizens before they can return. . . ""i think it is at least arguable that, if the restrictions are too onerous, then those restrictions would in substance amount to banishment or exclusion,"" he added. prof ong said he has written to moh for more information about the precise legal basis for the new pre-departure test requirement. he also suggested that exceptions be allowed, citing a hypothetical case of a singaporean abroad whose overseas visa or work permit may be expiring but cannot get access to a covid-19 test in time to return home, putting him at risk of overstaying. however, smu law don eugene tan said that while at first glance it might appear that the pre-departure test requirement for singaporeans is in breach of article 13(1), this is not the case. ""while article 13(1) is not explicitly subjected to any derogations or restrictions, a citizen who is not in singapore voluntarily cannot be said to be banished or excluded,"" associate professor tan said. instead, the testing requirement only means that a citizen will not be allowed to board a flight or ferry to singapore unless he has a negative covid-19 test result.  if the citizen does somehow make the journey to singapore, he will unlikely be denied entry, prof tan added. ""in other words, the pre-departure test requirement imposes a duty on the flight or ferry operator to ensure that all passengers travelling to singapore have the necessary negative test results based on their travel histories.  the constitutional guarantee provided by article 13(1) is in no way under threat. ""

prof tambyah said there seems to be a reluctance to ban flights and replace them with evacuation flights like what was done with wuhan at the start of the pandemic. hence, the new measure is a logical option despite its limitations. prof teo said he believes that the singapore government will not leave any citizen in the lurch during a medical emergency, but stressed that individuals also need to bear responsibility should they choose to travel out of singapore while the pandemic is still raging globally. he added: ""this is really a reminder to singaporeans and prs that they should avoid unnecessary travel out of singapore during this period, and if they choose to do so, to ensure they have the necessary insurance coverage for covid-19 medical evacuation if infected.

negative for covid-19 before being allowed to return home from high-risk countries kicked in at midnight on sunday (may 30).', ""infectious diseases experts say the move will help to protect front-line staff at the airport and could help to ease the load on singapore's healthcare system, which has had to deal with a spike in community cases in recent weeks."", 'but they also note that the measure has its limitations and implementing it is not as straightforward as it seems.', 'at least one legal expert has raised the issue of the constitutionality of the new requirement with the government.', 'the ministry of health (moh) said last wednesday that, from 11.', '59pm on saturday, all singaporeans and prs returning to the country will have to present a valid negative covid-19 polymerase chain reaction (pcr) test taken within 72 hours before their departure.', 'this is the first time moh has required singaporeans and prs to take a pre-departure test.', 'the ministry had previously said it did not want to make it difficult for them to return home, should they be caught unprepared by rapidly deteriorating pandemic conditions abroad.', ""the immigration and checkpoints authority's (ica) safetravel website says those travelling by plane or by boat will have to present their test result at the air and sea checkpoints upon arrival in singapore."", 'those who have stayed in lower-risk areas, including australia, brunei, china, hong kong, macau and new zealand, for the last 21 days are exempted.', 'children aged six and below are also exempted from the new requirement.', 'at land checkpoints, only prs entering singapore will need to present a valid negative test result.', 'prs who arrive in singapore overland without a valid negative test result may be denied entry.', 'those who fail to comply with the new requirement may have their entry or re-entry permit cancelled.', 'travellers must be tested by an accredited or authorised health centre in the country or region of departure.', ""documentary proof is required and ica recommends that travellers ask for a copy of the pcr test report that is in english or accompanied by an english translation, contains the traveller's name, date of birth and passport number, and shows the date and result of the test."", 'mr fin chua, 30, who has been living in thailand for eight years, planned to fly back to singapore next week to visit his father, who lives alone.', 'after hearing about the pre-departure test requirement, the business owner considered moving his flight earlier so he could return before the measure kicked in.', 'ultimately, mr chua did not do so.', 'instead, he moved his flight back by two weeks to mid-june, citing the lengthy 21-day stay-home notice he would have to serve if he came back home now.', 'mr chua feels that the new requirement is onerous as it is not easy getting a covid-19 pcr test in bangkok .', 'he said a pcr test in the thai capital costs about 2,000 baht (s$85) at a government clinic and 4,000 baht at a government hospital, but it is hard for foreigners to get tested as thais get priority.', 'the wait to get tested at the clinics can take hours, he said, unless one pays more to join a priority queue, which means a wait time of 15 to 30 minutes.', 'a pcr test in bangkok costs about 2,000 baht (s$85) at a government clinic and 4,000 baht at a government hospital, but it is hard for foreigners to get tested as thais get priority.', 'photo: epa-efe\nms cheryl wong, 30, who works in the film industry in new york, said she did not mind the new requirement as getting tested for covid-19 in the us city is easy and there are free services.', '""if i lived somewhere else with fewer testing options and undetermined turnaround times, i\'d probably be more annoyed,"" added ms wong, who is returning home on may 31 to renew her us work visa and to see her family after being away for 11⁄2 years.', 'she noted, though, that the new test requirement did not appear to take into account singaporeans or prs who had already been vaccinated, or that individuals may still test positive even though they may no longer be infectious.', 'she said: ""i\'m pretty sure i\'ll test negative because i\'m fully vaccinated and i am still cautious.', ""but there is that little bit of a 'what if'."", '""mr samuel phua, 23, who is coming home next month after graduating from the sibelius academy in finland, is also somewhat anxious about the pre-departure test.', '""it is allergy season here, and pollen allergies and covid-19 have symptoms that are quite similar.', ""i got myself tested recently and my results were negative, but there's always that sliver of doubt and worry that the next one may be positive."", '""but mr phua also said that the new requirement is an important step towards ensuring the safety of singaporeans both abroad and back home.', 'dr ling li min, an infectious disease physician from rophi clinic, said the decision to require citizens and prs to take pre-departure tests before they are allowed entry would have been a difficult one for the authorities to make.', 'limited access to swab testing facilities in some countries means that singaporeans living in places where covid-19 is raging may not be able to return home.', 'but with the recent spate of unlinked community cases, dr ling said, the authorities now have several fires to fight and the new testing requirement will help to minimise the risk of the virus spreading in singapore.', ""this is especially in the light of the fact that the changi airport cluster singapore's largest active cluster with more than 100 cases was traced to staff interactions with a family who flew in from south asia."", 'while dr ling acknowledged that pcr tests may not pick up every single case, she said the mandatory pre-departure tests will at least help to identify those who are infectious and prevent the virus from spreading on board flights into singapore.', 'she added: ""it is evident that a key vulnerability exists from when passengers disembark until they are taken to their stay-home notice facility.', 'this measure would further reduce the potential exposure to the virus for that part of the journey.', '""professor paul tambyah, deputy director of the national university of singapore (nus) yong loo lin school of medicine\'s infectious diseases translational research programme, also said the new measure would protect changi airport staff.', '""if this screening reduces the number of infected people passing through the airport even by a small proportion, it might reduce the risk to staff in particular to those who, for some reason or another, cannot take the vaccines,"" he said.', 'asked if the authorities should also extend the pre-departure test requirement to singaporeans and prs returning from lower-risk places, prof tambyah said it would be logical to mandate the test for everyone.', '""taiwan and vietnam were previously considered low-risk places, as was the state of victoria in australia.', 'these classifications can change rapidly,"" he added.', 'the new measure would protect changi airport staff, says professor paul tambyah.', ""st photo: mark cheong\nprofessor teo yik ying, dean of nus' saw swee hock school of public health, said implementing the new requirement may be more challenging than anticipated."", 'echoing a point made by prof tambyah, prof teo said not every jurisdiction will have commercial pcr testing capacity that is accredited and trustworthy.', 'hence, there is a need to ensure that singaporeans and prs who intend to travel to singapore are able to access proper testing.', 'otherwise, the testing requirement could be additional logistical hurdles for those returning as they would have to transit in cities where these tests are available, prof teo said.', 'he added: ""it will not be useful if returning travellers simply pay for a substandard test or a forged negative pcr test certificate.', '""there is also the issue of the government\'s responsibility towards citizens who test positive and cannot return home on a commercial flight.', 'moh said travellers who test positive on their pre-departure test should seek medical care and ensure that they have fully recovered and are non-infectious before travelling to singapore.', 'singaporeans who test positive for covid-19 while overseas and require urgent medical care can still return home via a medical evacuation flight or any other equivalent form of transport.', 'singapore management university assistant professor of law benjamin joshua ong noted that article 13(1) of the singapore constitution states that no citizen of singapore shall be ""banished or excluded"" from singapore.', 'the courts have not ruled on the precise meaning of the words ""banished"" or ""excluded"", he said.', '""it is possible that those words mean that anything preventing a citizen of singapore from travelling to singapore would be unconstitutional.', 'on the other hand, a court might also hold that it is acceptable for certain requirements to be imposed on citizens before they can return.', '.', '.', '""i think it is at least arguable that, if the restrictions are too onerous, then those restrictions would in substance amount to banishment or exclusion,"" he added.', 'prof ong said he has written to moh for more information about the precise legal basis for the new pre-departure test requirement.', 'he also suggested that exceptions be allowed, citing a hypothetical case of a singaporean abroad whose overseas visa or work permit may be expiring but cannot get access to a covid-19 test in time to return home, putting him at risk of overstaying.', 'however, smu law don eugene tan said that while at first glance it might appear that the pre-departure test requirement for singaporeans is in breach of article 13(1), this is not the case.', '""while article 13(1) is not explicitly subjected to any derogations or restrictions, a citizen who is not in singapore voluntarily cannot be said to be banished or excluded,"" associate professor tan said.', 'instead, the testing requirement only means that a citizen will not be allowed to board a flight or ferry to singapore unless he has a negative covid-19 test result.', 'if the citizen does somehow make the journey to singapore, he will unlikely be denied entry, prof tan added.', '""in other words, the pre-departure test requirement imposes a duty on the flight or ferry operator to ensure that all passengers travelling to singapore have the necessary negative test results based on their travel histories.', 'the constitutional guarantee provided by article 13(1) is in no way under threat. ""', 'travellers should ensure that they have fully recovered and are non-infectious before travelling to singapore.', 'st photo: mark cheong\nprof tambyah said there seems to be a reluctance to ban flights and replace them with evacuation flights like what was done with wuhan at the start of the pandemic.', 'hence, the new measure is a logical option despite its limitations.', 'prof teo said he believes that the singapore government will not leave any citizen in the lurch during a medical emergency, but stressed that individuals also need to bear responsibility should they choose to travel out of singapore while the pandemic is still raging globally.', 'he added: ""this is really a reminder to singaporeans and prs that they should avoid unnecessary travel out of singapore during this period, and if they choose to do so, to ensure they have the necessary insurance coverage for covid-19 medical evacuation if infected.', '""join st\'s telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.', 'sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.', 'no.', '198402868e.', 'all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.', 'until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.', 'but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.']",data/2021-5-31.csv,"Myanmar junta moves civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, ex-president Win Myint to 'unknown location', SE Asia News & Top Stories."

  vietnam plans to test all nine million people in its largest city for the coronavirus and imposed more restrictions on monday to deal with a growing covid-19 outbreak. people in ho chi minh city are only allowed to leave home for necessary activities and public gatherings of more than 10 people are banned for the next two weeks, the government announced. prior to the order, the city, also vietnam's economic hub, shut down non-essential business last thursday when cases started to increase. state newspaper vietnam news said the city authority is planning to test its entire population with a testing capacity of 1,00,000 samples a day. the newspaper also said police had filed a case on sunday against the couple who head a protestant church mission for ""spreading dangerous infectious diseases,"" citing poor health protocols applied at the premises. at least 145 cases of coronavirus infection have been reported with links to the revival ekklesia mission, a protestant sect, and the city district of go vap, where the church is based, has been locked down.  vietnam has since banned all religious events nationwide. the newspaper said church followers gathered in small space for singing and chanting without proper distancing and mask wearing.  ho chi minh city police said the mission has 48 registered members. the report said the husband and wife accused in the case were responsible for leading and organising activities at the church.  they were not identified and are not under arrest. since the end of april, a surge in covid-19 has spread to 31 municipalities and provinces in vietnam with over 4,000 cases, almost double the total number that the country reported since the beginning of the pandemic. some recent patients in vietnam were infected with a hybrid of the virus variants first found in india and the u. k. , the health minister said on saturday.  nguyen thanh long said the hybrid might spread more easily and could be responsible for vietnam's recent surge. viruses often develop small genetic changes as they reproduce, and new variants of the coronavirus have been seen almost since it was first detected in china in late 2019.  the world health organization categorised the u. k.  and the indian variants, along with two others first found in south africa and brazil, as ""variants of concern"" because they appear to be more contagious. vietnam has vaccinated one million people with astrazeneca shots.  it has a deal with pfizer for 30 million doses to be delivered later this year.  it is also in talks with moderna that would give it enough shots to fully vaccinate 80% of its 96 million people.

2021-05-31,400K students in S'pore can opt for COVID vaccine from 1 Jun.,"singapore — from tuesday (1 june), some 400,000 students from schools and institutes of higher learning (ihls) can register for the covid-19 vaccine as part of the national vaccination exercise. those from the graduating cohorts taking their n, o or a-level exams or the equivalent in the second-half of 2021, numbering about 56,000, will be prioritised.  ""these students will be the first to receive their invitations to be vaccinated so that they can have greater flexibility in scheduling their vaccination appointments in view of their upcoming national examinations,"" said the ministry of educationover the next two weeks, similar invitations will be progressively extended to other groups of full-time students, including the privately-funded schools, madrasahs and special education (sped) schools.  international schools will not be included in this vaccination exercise.  the pfizer-biontech vaccine will be administered to those aged 12 to 15, while older students can choose between the pfizer or moderna vaccine.  the interval between doses will be six to eight weeks.  the first shots for students are expected to be given on 3 june.  once they are vaccinated, the vaccination exercise will be opened to young adults aged 39 and below.  last month, the multi-ministry taskforce (mtf) on covid-19 authorised the use of vaccines in those aged 12-15.  studies and data have shown that the pfizer and moderna vaccines are effective and safe for individuals aged 12 and above, and aged 18 and above respectively. students or parents/guardians of those under 18 will receive smses with a unique link for them to book appointments at any of the vaccination centres.  those below 18 years will only be offered appointment slots at sites with the pfizer vaccine.  parental or guardian consent will be required for these students as part of the booking process via the national appointment system (nas).  consent will be collected once, and apply for both doses.  parent or guardian accompaniment at the vaccination site is only required for children aged 12 and children in sped schools. the main vaccination exercise for most students will be through the nas as this will give maximum flexibility in choice of dates and venues, and for students to get vaccinated early. vaccinations for students will take place at community vaccination centres.  from 7 june, there will also be four dedicated moe vaccination centres, of which three will be at ite college campuses, jointly set up by moe and the health promotion board (hpb), and one at raffles city convention centre. as all three ite campuses will have moe vaccination centres, ite students will take their shots on-campus, to make use of this dedicated capacity. to facilitate access for students in sped schools who may find it challenging to visit a vaccination site, moh will deploy mobile vaccination teams to the schools to carry out vaccinations for all sped students aged 12 and above. ""while the covid-19 vaccination is not mandatory, we would like to encourage all medically eligible students to be vaccinated when the vaccine is made available to them.  this is our way of protecting not just our students and education institutions, but also their families and the wider community,"" said moe.  more information on the vaccination exercise for students can be found here.

2021-05-31,"In Malaysia, tire maker Goodyear accused of unpaid wages, threats.","foreign workers say the us company made wrongful salary deductions, excessive long hours & held onto workers' passports. american tire manufacturer goodyear tire & rubber co is facing accusations of unpaid wages, unlawful overtime and threats to foreign workers at its malaysian factory, according to court documents and complaints filed by workers. in interviews with reuters, six current and former foreign workers, as well as officials in malaysia's labour department, say goodyear made wrongful salary deductions, required excessive hours and denied workers full access to their passports. the department confirmed it had fined goodyear in 2020 for overworking and underpaying foreign employees.  one former worker said the company illegally kept his passport, showing reuters an acknowledgement letter he signed in january 2020 upon getting it back eight years after he started working at goodyear. the allegations, which reuters is the first to report, initially surfaced when 185 foreign workers filed three complaints against goodyear malaysia in the country's industrial court, two in 2019 and one in 2020, over non-compliance with a collective labour agreement.  the workers alleged the company was not giving them shift allowances, annual bonuses and pay increases even though these benefits were available to local staff, who are represented by a labour union. the court ruled in favour of the foreign workers in two of the cases last year, saying they were entitled to the same rights as malaysian employees, according to copies of the judgement published on the court's website.  goodyear was ordered to pay back wages and comply with the collective agreement, according to the judgement and the workers' lawyer. about 150 worker payslips, which the lawyer said were submitted to court as evidence of unpaid wages and reviewed by reuters, showed some migrants working as many as 229 hours a month in overtime, exceeding the malaysian limit of 104 hours. the foreign workers are claiming about 5 million ringgit ($1. 21m) in unpaid wages, said their lawyer, chandra segaran rajandran.  the workers are from nepal, myanmar and india. ""they are put in a situation where they are being denied their full rights as what is provided for (by law),"" he said, adding that it amounted to ""discrimination"". goodyear malaysia has said foreign workers are not entitled to the same benefits as they are not union members [file: tom brenner/reuters]goodyear, one of the world's largest tire makers, has challenged both verdicts at the high court.  the appeal decision is expected on july 26.  the verdict for the third case, over the same issues, is due in the coming weeks. goodyear declined to comment on any of the allegations, citing the court process.  according to the court ruling last year, goodyear malaysia argued that foreign workers are not entitled to the benefits of the collective agreement because they are not union members. according to the ruling, a union representative testified that foreign workers are eligible to join and are entitled to the benefits in the collective agreement even if they are not members.  the court agreed that the foreign workers' job scope entitled them to those benefits. goodyear told reuters it has strong policies and practices relating to and protecting human rights. ""we take seriously any allegations of improper behaviour relating to our associates, operations and supply chain,"" a representative said in an email. the union – the national union of employees in companies manufacturing rubber products – did not respond to reuters' requests for comment on the workers' complaints. goodyear's malaysia operation is jointly owned by the country's largest fund manager, permodalan nasional berhad, which directed queries to goodyear. workers said they faced intimidation from goodyear after they filed the lawsuits.  goodyear declined to comment. ""the company had different rules for different sets of workers,"" said sharan kumar rai, who filed one of the lawsuits and worked at goodyear in malaysia from 2012 until last year. the foreign workers filed the first two lawsuits in july 2019.  soon afterwards, goodyear asked some to sign letters, without their lawyer's knowledge, that they would withdraw from the legal action – according to their lawyer, police complaints filed in october 2019 and a copy of the letter seen by reuters.  reporting a complaint to the police does not always result in criminal charges but can trigger an investigation. industrial court chairman anna ng fui choo said in her ruling that the letter ""was an act of unfair labour practice"". malaysia's labour department told reuters it had investigated and charged goodyear in 2020 over nine violations of labour laws, unrelated to the lawsuits, regarding excessive hours and wrongful salary deductions.  it fined goodyear 41,500 ringgit ($10,050), it said. malaysia has in recent years faced accusations from its own human resources ministry and authorities in the united states of labour abuse at its factories, which rely on millions of migrant workers to manufacture everything from palm oil to medical gloves and iphone components. malaysia is battling a rapidly escalating coronavirus outbreak that has strained the country's healthcare system. company at centre of malaysia's biggest covid-19 outbreak fired worker who raised concerns about overcrowding. economy shrank by a worse-than-expected 5. 6 percent last year, with lockdowns likely to lead to more pain, analysts say. ministers have given approval to giving jab to millions of non-malaysians as it battles surging cases. follow al jazeera

2021-05-31,"Protection from Harassment Court to be established on Jun 1 to make it easier, faster for victims to obtain relief.","singapore: singapore will establish the protection from harassment court on jun 1, which will allow for easier and faster processing of relief for harassment victims, according to a joint release issued by the ministry of law and the state courts on monday (may 31). the new specialised court will hear all criminal and civil matters under the protection from harassment act (poha) and will adopt a simplified process for certain types of applications, including those for protection orders and orders relating to falsehoods. under the simplified track, a claimant can file a claim online and at lower cost through the state courts'community justice and tribunals systemthat is accessible 24/7. this is as opposed to the current process, which requires travelling to filing bureaus to file an originating summons with a supporting affidavit in-person, said the authorities. the system also offers a pre-filing assessment for people to assess the validity of their claims. claims that can be made under the simplified track must involve only one claimant and no more than five respondents, be brought within two years from the date that the course of action is accrued, and not include a claim for damages above s$20,000. hearings will also be conducted more quickly under the new court, which will target to conduct hearings for expedited protection orders within 48 to 72 hours of the application. this target is reduced to within 24 hours where there is a ""risk of violence or actual violence"", said the authorities. the court will aim to hear protection orders within four weeks of the application. respondents can also initiate an ""enegotiation"" process on the system to try and reach an amicable settlement with a claimant, said the authorities. cases in the protection from harassment court may be transferred to other courts, and vice versa. ""this transfer mechanism recognises how harassment may occur against the backdrop of other ongoing proceedings, such as divorce proceedings,"" said the authorities. from jun 1, cases may be transferred between the protection from harassment court and district court or magistrate's court.  transfers with the family court will be operationalised at a later date. enhanced protectionseveral changes to enhance protection for victims of harassment will also come into effect on jun 1. firstly, victims will face fewer hurdles to obtain protection orders.  if a respondent has been convicted of any poha or hurt-related offence against the victim, the requirement to show that a poha provision has been contravened – which is necessary before a protection order can be granted – will be ""deemed satisfied"". ""victims will not have to relive their experience more than necessary, to obtain protection,"" said the authorities. secondly, judges granting expedited protection orders will be required to consider whether a criminal investigation is warranted, and if so, to refer cases to the police for investigation. people who have breached protection orders or expedited protection orders can also be arrested in prescribed scenarios, such as where hurt is caused. these changes are being introduced because in egregious cases of hurt or harassment, it may not be enough to grant the victim a civil remedy, said the authorities. thirdly, protection orders and expedited protection orders will be further extended to protect people related to the victim, as they may also be harassed by the same perpetrator. it will also be made clear that domestic exclusion orders – which restrain the perpetrator from entering the victim's residence or parts of the residence – can be granted as part of a protection order. this will ensure better protection for victims who may stay in the same residence as the harasser, said the authorities. the establishment of the protection from harassment court and the other amendments are provided for under the protection from harassment (amendment) bill 2019 passed by parliament in may 2019. minister for law k shanmugam said at the time the changes to the law were a ""crucial step"". ""the message is clear: it is unacceptable for perpetrators, the penalties are increased, toughened, the legal framework is even stricter, so even if it's a civil order, protection order, if you breach it, the police will come after you.  it's an absolute no-no, not acceptable,"" mr shanmugam had said. ""for the victims, it's both that the law will protect you . . .  but also that we have to increase awareness, we have to make them understand that they don't need to be in such relationships, that they can walk out, that there is a system that will protect them.

""our military aircraft will bring the vaccine home (within this week) to inoculate military-affiliated members, including reservists,"" kim said, presiding over a government disaster management meeting.   ""i'd like to express gratitude to president biden and the u. s.  government for the decision, which demonstrated the staunch korea-u. s.  alliance,"" he added.  the korea disease control and prevention agency (kdca) said later that 1,012,800 doses are to arrive here early next month.  the vaccines will be administered to reservists, members of civil defense and those involved in the country's defense and foreign affairs who are 30 and older.  those under 30 will be excluded amid concerns over blood clotting.  volunteers will get a shot between june 10-20 after making reservations.  those eligible are 538,000 reservists, 3 million members of civil defense and around 137,000 people in the defense and foreign affairs circle.  of those in the defense sector, spouses and children of senior officials and civilian workers will also be eligible if they live together and are 30 or older.  of active-duty south korean troops, more than 116,700 in their 30s and older

to people leaving the country on essential business.  in april, south korea authorized the use of janssen's single-shot regimen as the country's third approved vaccine, though this type of vaccine is yet to be administered.  around 10 million americans, including members of the u. s.  forces korea (usfk), have received j&j's.  with the new delivery, south korea will have secured vaccines for 100 million people in a country of 52 million.  the vaccines are made by astrazeneca, pfizer, j&j, moderna and novavax.  around 10 percent of the population has currently received their first dose.

""there is no curfew, but i hope no one will be outside after 8pm, because there will be no economic activity after that time,"" datuk seri ismail said during the joint briefing with health chief noor hisham abdullah. mr ismail said that the closure of most economic sectors will reduce the number of people leaving their homes for work from 15 million to just 1. 5 million. most factories in the manufacturing sector will be closed, except for factories involved in making essential products such as food and beverages, and healthcare items.  however, these will be limited to operating at only 60 per cent capacity, and from 8am to 8pm.  factories were a key source of workplace clusters, after the government allowed them to remain open under a movement control order (mco) implemented earlier in may, citing economic concerns.  on sunday, mr ismail also announced tighter controls on travel permits granted to those who cross districts and states for work, saying these will expire on may 31.  new letters will be issued by relevant ministries for workers in the essential sectors that are allowed to operate from june 1.  the two-week stringent lockdown is part of a three-phase measure announced by prime minister muhyiddin yassin on friday to battle malaysia's deadliest surge of covid-19 infections since the pandemic began in early 2020. if the two-week lockdown succeeds, malaysia is expected to move to a month-long, more relaxed version of the mco that will allow most economic sectors to reopen while maintaining travel bans and prohibitions on social activities.  malaysia on saturday reported 9,020 new infections and 98 deaths from the coronavirus record highs in both categories.  cases dipped slightly to 6,999 new infections with 79 deaths on sunday, but active cases continued to climb as recoveries remained lagging behind new infections.  malaysia now has 78,017 active coronavirus cases, with 846 people receiving intensive care treatment at its hospitals, which the authorities have warned are strained and could soon be overwhelmed if cases continue to rise.  about half of those in intensive care are on ventilator support.  tan sri noor hisham had previously warned that the country might hit five-digit daily cases and log up to 13,000 daily infections by mid-june if the current infectivity rate of the transmission remains.  tan sri muhyiddin's perikatan nasional coalition partner umno and also former prime minister mahathir mohamad had previously called for a full lockdown to be implemented to stem the surge in infections.  mr muhyiddin has promised to deliver a fiscal relief package following this lockdown, but the government has yet to release any details of the aid package. finance minister tengku zafrul tengku abdul aziz previously warned that a total lockdown could cost the country up to a million jobs. mr muhyiddin last year said that the two-month lockdown in 2020 cost the country rm2. 4 billion (s$767 million) a day. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-05-31,"Some employers in Singapore holding on to maids' passports illegally, Singapore News & Top Stories.","read 3 articles daily and stand to win st rewards, including the st news tablet worth $398. spin the wheel for st read and win now. singapore a new initiative to pay random visits to employers and their foreign domestic workers has uncovered some instances of employers illegally holding on to their workers' passports and work permits. the ministry of manpower (mom) has made 200 such checks since last month. domestic workers and migrant welfare groups told the straits times (st) that the new measures, which include conducting more in-person interviews with maids, would help ensure decent living and working arrangements for them. advocacy groups, however, said that mandating proper conditions would be even better. in response to queries from st, an mom spokesman said: ""thus far, employers have been supportive and allowed our officers to interview their migrant domestic workers (mdws). ""the initiative comes on the heels of a few cases where domestic helpers were badly abused.  in february, housewife gaiyathiri murugayan admitted to starving and torturing myanmar maid piang ngaih don, 24, leading to her death. as at december last year, 247,000 work permits had been issued for foreign domestic workers, the mom spokesman added. mom also said its officers are trained to look out for signs of abuse and pick up cues of stress and anxiety while speaking to domestic helpers.  each house visit typically lasts 20 minutes. in-person interviews with workers are done by the centre for domestic employees (cde), an initiative of the national trades union congress.  since late 2017, the centre has interviewed an average of 2,000 randomly selected domestic workers a month, and it aims to expand the interviews to cover all first-time migrant domestic workers by the year end. due to the covid-19 pandemic, the cde currently conducts interviews by video. cde executive director shamsul kamar said: ""common areas of concern raised by a small number of migrant domestic workers include insufficient rest and food; having their personal documents such as passports, work permits, contract being withheld from them; unsafe work environment, methods; or illegal deployment and salary issues.  these cases are reported to mom for further investigation. ""mr shamsul added that cde reports cases where domestic helpers are physically harmed by their employer to the police immediately. indonesian domestic helper nelvin ganaga said she is happy to hear of mom's new initiative. she said it is important for mom to ensure that domestic workers have sufficient time and space to talk to their families and make friends in singapore. the 39-year-old experienced abuse with a former employer in 2015.  the employer's daughter and mother would step on ms ganaga when she slept at night and even spat in her food once.  the seven-year-old child would also pinch ms ganaga until she was bruised and continued to do so even after being scolded by ms ganaga's employer. although ms ganaga asked to return to her agency, her employer refused and sent her back to jakarta instead.  ms ganaga then spent a month in batam before coming back to singapore, but it meant she had to pay new agency fees all over again to work here. ms ganaga began working in 2016 for her current employer, with whom she has a good relationship.  she treats the family's children like her own, she said. employers who spoke to st said they support the house visits as that is one way to ensure domestic helpers are being treated fairly. ms ganaga's current employer, ms lau joon-nie, 50, said: ""it's a step in the right direction to check on mdws' well-being and mental health, given that it's been a tough year for everyone and those of them who were due for home leave would not have been able to return. ""added ms lau, director of a non-profit organisation that focuses on the media industry: ""helpers are not mind readers, nor did they grow up in the environment we did, so they cannot be assumed to know what we expect from them.  it helps to ask oneself: how would you want your employer to treat you if you were in their shoes?"" local migrant welfare groups said more can be done to support foreign domestic workers here. the former president of transient workers count too (twc2), mr john gee, listed equipping each domestic helper with a mobile phone, easing their terms for transfer and giving them access to an employer's past record on hired help as other steps that can be implemented. he also said the authorities should look into ensuring helpers have a mandatory day off each week which cannot be negotiated away for payment. ""a worker who goes out freely can seek advice from other workers, non-governmental organisations, her agents or mom and could leave her employers if she felt desperate enough.  in such cases, potential abusers might well think twice before acting, and workers could act in their own defence before any abuse escalated,"" he said. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

""i am concerned about how her sister is coping with all this.  her sister visits her regularly and told me she is always worried that there is no food in the house,"" said mrs rose, who runs an online business. it is understood that the sister called the police when she went to visit and found the woman had locked herself in. mr wang zhen ming, 60, who lives in the unit directly above the woman's, said he knew something was wrong only when scdf officers knocked on his door. ""they asked if they could hang something from my kitchen window as it would help in rescuing a woman. ""i can't believe i was in my living room the entire time and didn't hear any noise from downstairs,"" the warehouse clerk added. scdf said it deployed a safety life air pack, and rescuers from the disaster assistance and rescue team were on standby as a precautionary measure. photo: lianhe wanbaoa hawker, 58, who wanted to be known only as ms wong, was on her way to work when she saw scdf truck. ""i live a few of blocks away and my first thought was there was a fire.  but some residents told me a woman was sitting on the window ledge. . . then she went back into her flat when the police arrived,"" she said. the police said they gained entry to the unit at 12. 30pm.

2021-05-31,Woman Violently Slaps 8-Year-Old Child For Stepping On Her Foot In MRT Train.,"in a shocking incident, a woman admitted to slapping an 8-year-old girl in the face on an mrt train.  she apparently wanted the child to apologise for stepping on her foot before stepping off. the woman has pleaded guilty on friday (28 may) to one charge of voluntarily causing hurt to the little girl. image source: istockthe incident took place on 15 july, 2020, when the 8-year-old and her mother were at chua chu kang station.  after boarding the mrt train, the girl accidentally stepped on connnie soh's foot. according to the straits times, the 45-year-old was talking loudly on her phone the did not hear the child apologise to her. soh then confronted the girl's mother and asked her why her daughter did not apologise.  an argument began as the mother insisted her daughter did say 'sorry. 'when the girl and her mother were about to exit the train carriage as they reached yew tee station, soh slapped the child on her left cheek.  this was in an attempt to prevent her from leaving the train without apologising. the 8-year-old began crying so her mother called the police from the station.  afterwards, the girl was taken to national university hospital where a doctor notes that she sustained a left cheek contusion or bruise. the little girl was given a two-day medical certificate with an excuse from physical activity that year. deputy public prosecutor joseph gwee urged the court to sentence soh with a fine of at least $5,000 for her actions.  her response to the incident was said to be an ""objectively disproportionate one committed in a public place. ""soh also faces one other charge of using criminal force to poke the nose of the child's mother which will be taken into account during her sentencing. she is scheduled for sentencing on 18 june. image source: istockfor voluntarily causing hurt, an offender can face jail time for up to three years, fined up to $5,000 or both–in singapore.  but since the little girl was under the age of 14 years, soh faces double this maximum penalty. so is slapping a child actually counted as abusive behaviour? according to the ministry of social and family development (msf), any act that can cause an injury to a child can constitute physical abuse.  such actions that can cause bruises or cuts include:beatingshaking""excessive discipline""while there has been some debate on whether caning should still be used as a form of punishment, experts advise that parents use different ways to discipline their children.  instead of hitting or yelling at them, let your child off on a warning.  better yet, sit them down and check in on them, ask them about the things that may be bothering them and pushing them to behave rebelliously. you can also use the incentive approach and ask them to finish a task in exchange for a reward.  this gives you as well as your child to cool off. in addition, taking some time off is important for both parents and kids.  it will give you the opportunity to cool down and similarly, your kids will get a chance to introspect on where they have gone wrong. at the end of the day, caning or yelling might be a short-term solution.  but in the long run, it can emotionally damage to your child.  don't let your impulse or anger overpower actions, which you might regret later. singapore mum whatsapp groups ablaze with chats on cane shops and assessment books for kidsshocking!

""following an interview with the said staff (member), the madrasah made a police report on the unauthorised transfer of the madrasah's confidential documents to third parties,"" said muis. the police confirmed to the straits times that a report was lodged and that they are looking into the matter. the council said the staff member has resigned from madrasah irsyad with immediate effect and that the school will not be able to provide further details, given that the matter is under police investigation. it added that the stolen documents are linked to an ongoing review of the madrasah's financial transactions. muis reiterated that ""it takes any allegations of financial irregularities very seriously and is undertaking the necessary steps to look into the matter"". the review had been stated in a parliamentary reply on april 5 by minister-in-charge of muslim affairs masagos zulkifli, who was responding to mr faisal manap of the workers' party. mr faisal, an mp for aljunied grc, had then asked, among other things, for details on any links between madrasah irsyad and irsyad trust limited (itl), and if any investigations were conducted in 2019 and 2020 regarding allegations of abuse of power in the madrasah. the allegations were regarding a former senior director of madrasah at muis, who had also been chief executive of itl since 2014. mr faisal had asked if the financial reports for both these bodies had been made public, and if there had been any transfer of funds from the madrasah to itl. mr masagos had answered then that there was no affiliation between itl and madrasah irsyad, and that the two had not been affiliated with each other since january. itl was established as a separate company in 2006 by the madrasah's management committee, under the name irsyad foundation limited. in august 2008, muis brought madrasah irsyad into its joint madrasah system, but the school's management continued to oversee its fund-raising efforts, including international projects in training and education.  funds raised from these projects went towards supporting madrasah irsyad's local operations. in 2014, madrasah irsyad's management moved the international side of its fund-raising efforts to itl. during a 2016 audit of madrasah irsyad's accounts, however, it was discovered that the school's management had endorsed a transfer of $2 million to itl for its international operations. ""muis requested itl to repay the monies to the madrasah.  itl returned the $2 million in full to the madrasah in 2016,"" said mr masagos. he added that after a review last year, madrasah irsyad decided to de-prioritise its international projects.  both the school and itl agreed that they would no longer be affiliated with each other from january this year, which meant that itl could no longer use the school's branding for its international projects. muis then asked for a review of the financial transactions between madrasah irsyad and itl, which is ongoing, and will consider further actions based on the findings of the review. the minister said that while muis had conducted an internal investigation into madrasah irsyad staff after a complaint, it was not linked to itl or the former muis senior director, who resigned in 2016. he added that while it was not muis' practice for religious schools to publish their financial statements, each school is required to submit them to muis for final audit purposes. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-05-31,"Hong Kong Eases Quarantine for Vaccinated Execs, Drawing Ire.","hong kong is allowing vaccinated directors and senior executives of major listed companies to travel globally more easily, a significant relaxation of its onerous border curbs that's drawing backlash from the wider population for being elitist. vaccinated senior executives from about 500 companies included in indexes like the hang seng and hang seng china enterprises can seek permission to travel in and out of the city without needing to follow the current quarantine requirement, hong kong's financial services and the treasury bureau said in a statement monday. the clarification of a wider policy of exemption for vaccinated executives comes in the wake of a friday announcement that some vaccinated senior bankers can skip quarantine.  however, the move is likely to deepen public ire over the special treatment, as hong kong's traveler quarantine requirements are some of the strictest in the world and require people to pay for hotel room stays -- the supply of which is rapidly drying up for the summer months. the current rules stipulate that everyone arriving in hong kong from outside china must isolate in a hotel for up to 21 days.  pressure is building on the government to drastically relax quarantine and other social restrictions for vaccinated people as incentives to re-open borders and to boost hong kong's low vaccination rate. senior bankers can now skip hong kong's three-week quarantine""it's a step in the right direction.  is that enough? we believe it is by far not enough,"" said frederick gollob, chairman of the european chamber of commerce in hong kong.  ""with the combination of vaccination and ongoing testing, the hong kong government should further, on a broader scale, reduce the quarantine requirement on the way to reopening the city. ""the latest quarantine exemption is available to other firms from financial industries like banking, mobile payments, insurance, securities and futures intermediaries.  companies are allowed a limited quota of exemptions and the government will review applications based on criteria like where the executive is traveling from.  the executives must undergo testing and are required to stick to pre-approved itineraries. an earlier version of the quarantine exemption policy has existed since last year for executives coming from mainland china.  singapore, asia's other major financial hub, does not grant exemptions from travel quarantine for business executives. banks lauded the new announcement. ""we welcome the new measure providing more convenience to vaccinated senior executives when traveling to hong kong.  this helps encourage resumption of necessary business travel and brings business activities gradually back to normal, which is particularly important to hong kong as an international financial center,"" said a standard chartered plc spokeswoman in a statement. hsbc holdings plc said in a statement, ""while the pandemic has showed how much could be accomplished virtually, a measured approach to facilitate business travels to and from hong kong could help stimulate more economic activities across a range of sectors. even within the business community however, some think that the exemptions are not being rolled out widely enough.  the american chamber of commerce, for example, said that the exemption should be ""extended across sectors. """"all businesses have suffered, and all are keen to get safely back on the road again,"" said the chamber's president tara joseph in a statement. however, the government has not signaled that it plans to significantly relax social-distancing rules for vaccinated people, such as mandatory outdoor masking, citing the low vaccination uptake.  some medical experts also continue to recommend social restriction remain in place in order to prevent another wave of covid-19, particularly as the vaccination rate is low, though local infection numbers have hovered at or near zero for weeks. some critics argue, however, that it's precisely the lack of privileges for vaccinated people that is keeping the inoculation rate depressed -- just 13. 4% of hong kong's population of 7. 5 million has been fully inoculated, according to bloomberg's covid-19 vaccine tracker, far behind other finance centers like london and singapore. chief executive carrie lam separately announced on the same day a new campaign to boost the city's slow inoculation rate by september, with measures such as paid leave for vaccinated civil servants and possible additional restrictions for unvaccinated citizens.  the government said it aims to announce further relaxations of rules for vaccinated people by june 10. now that the door has been open for quarantine exemption for some vaccinated people, the policy should be expanded to all fully inoculated people, said ben cowling, professor at the school of public health at the university of hong kong. exemption is ""an evidence-based measure given that vaccinated people are substantially less likely to be infected.  such a measure could also encourage greater vaccination uptake,"" he said. the government has instead been leaning on businesses and institutions to encourage injections. hong kong turns to businesses to fix foundering vaccine push still, the special treatment meted out to a small elite of executives is likely to further stoke public anger, already at high levels following more than a year of strict social restrictions and quarantine policies that have seen thousands forced from their homes to isolate in government-run camps.  the continuing quarantine policies for travelers also means that as vaccinated people in the u. s.  and european countries plan their summer travel, almost no one will be able to travel into hong kong without shouldering the prohibitive time and cost of quarantine. ally, a hong kong citizen who currently lives in canada, said she's extremely upset that ""as long as you are rich and powerful"" you can skip the requirements that most people must observe.  ally, who asked that only her english name be used, said she has been unable to return to hong kong after her father died last year.  a single mother, she can't afford the cost of a 21-day quarantine, which would require her to be away from work without pay. ""you can imagine how infuriating it is that someone else is exempt because of money and i have lost my only remaining parent,"" she said. the issue isn't just the time and cost of quarantine. as the length of hotel isolation for those traveling from some countries, including the u. s. , has dropped to two weeks for vaccinated people, demand for rooms has skyrocketed.  numerous accommodations, especially those at lower price points, are fully booked through the end of the current quarantine period, which runs until june 19. the food and health bureau said monday that the supply of rooms would be increased from the current 8,300 to 10,000.  some hotels will open up more rooms for booking, it said. — with assistance by denise wee, kiuyan wong, bruce einhorn, and alfred

2021-05-31,Sri Lanka Launches Probe After Burning Ship Leads To Pollution Crisis.,"mv x-press pearl caught fire on colombo coast on may 20. sri lanka launched a criminal probe on sunday into a massive container ship fire that has swamped the island nation's coast with plastic pollution in an unprecedented marine disaster. tonnes of microplastic granules have inundated the south asian country's famed beaches, forcing a fishing ban and prompting fears of ecological damage. the singapore-registered mv x-press pearl has been smouldering on the horizon for 11 days after a blaze broke out as it was heading to colombo from gujarat, india. the 25-member crew, who have already been evacuated from the ship, will be questioned on monday after a complaint was lodged by sri lanka's marine environment protection authority, police said. last week, authorities said they believed the fire was caused by a nitric acid leak that the crew had been aware of since may 11. ""the captain and the crew were in quarantine, but health authorities have told us that we can question them from tomorrow,"" ajith rohana, a police spokesperson, told afp. ""we have already sent samples of polluted seawater and burnt debris from the vessel for a forensic report.

""these students will be the first to receive their invitations to be vaccinated so that they can have greater flexibility in scheduling their vaccination appointments in view of their upcoming national examinations,"" the press release read. over the next two weeks, the remaining full-time students in schools and institutes of higher learning will receive their invitations to register for the vaccine, said the education ministry. this includes privately-funded schools, madrasahs and special education schools, said moe in the press release.  privately-funded schools comprise anglo-chinese school (international), st.  joseph's institution international high school and hwa chong international school. students below 18 will only be offered the pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccine, while those aged 18 and above can opt for either vaccines from pfizer-biontech or moderna, said the education ministry. for both vaccines, the interval between the first and second dose will be six to eight weeks, said moe in a briefing earlier on monday. eligible students aged 18 and above as well as parents of children below 18 will progressively receive smses with a unique registration link, said the ministry. parents of students in graduating cohorts who do not receive the sms by jun 3 should contact their children's school for assistance. ""schools will also be reaching out to parents of students in mainstream primary and secondary schools separately with additional details on their vaccinations.  in general, students who are in schools and the ihls should receive their smses by the end of the second week of june,"" the factsheet read. sms invites will only be sent to parents or guardians of children who are 12 years old as of jun 1.  those whose 12th birthday falls after jun 1 will be invited for vaccination at a later date, said moe. parental or guardian consent is required for students below 18, as part of the booking process for the vaccination slots through the national appointment system, said the ministry.  consent given via the system will be collected once and will apply for both doses of the vaccine. parents or guardians of students aged 13 and above do not need to accompany the child to the vaccination centre while children who are 12 years old and all students in special education schools must be accompanied by a parent or guardian. eligible students can get vaccinated at community vaccination centres.  there will also be four dedicated moe vaccination centres set up at raffles city convention centre, ite college central, ite college east and ite college west, said moe. ite will arrange for their students to take their vaccinations on campus to make use of the dedicated capacity, the ministry added. each ite centre can take up to 1,600 vaccination slots per day, ""comparable"" to community vaccination centres, while raffles convention centre can take up to 2,000 slots per day, said moe in a briefing earlier on monday. the ministry will also deploy a mobile vaccination team to special education schools to carry out the vaccinations for all eligible special education students, to ""facilitate access"" for students who might find it challenging to visit a vaccination centre, it said. the vaccination exercise for students is expected to be completed by august, said moe at the briefing earlier on monday. ""all medically eligible individuals are encouraged to consider getting vaccinated when the vaccination is offered to them.  and we would like to thank all parents for working closely with our educators and schools to keep our children safe,"" said mr chan. downloadour appor subscribe to our telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:https://cna. asia/telegramit looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-05-31,Why scientists are concerned about leaks at biolabs.,"this general view shows the wuhan institute of virology in wuhan, in china's central hubei province on 3 february 2021, as members of the world health organization (who) team investigating the origins of the covid-19 coronavirus, visit/afp/hector retamal. the theory that covid-19 might be the result of scientific experiments has thrown a spotlight on the work of the world's most secure biolabs. while the evidence linking sars-cov-2 to the wuhan institute of virology in china is strictly circumstantial, a number of experts want tougher controls on such facilities over fears that accidental leaks could touch off the next pandemic. here's what you should know. the wuhan lab belongs to the most secure class, commonly referred to as biosafety level 4, or bsl4. these are built to work safely and securely with the most dangerous bacteria and viruses that can cause serious diseases for which there are no known treatment or vaccines. ""there are hvac filtration systems, so that the virus can't escape through exhaust; any waste water that leaves the facility is treated with either chemicals or high temperatures to make sure that there's nothing alive,"" gregory koblentz, director of the biodefense graduate program at george mason university, told afp. the researchers themselves are highly trained and wear hazmat suits. there are 59 such facilities across the world, according to a report koblentz co-authored that was released this week. ""there are no binding international standards for safe, secure, and responsible work on pathogens,"" the report, called mapping maximum biological containment labs globally, said. accidents can happen, sometimes at the top tier facilities, and much more frequently at lower rung labs of which there are thousands. human h1n1 virus — the same flu that caused the 1918 pandemic — leaked in 1977 in the soviet union and china and spread worldwide. in 2001, a mentally disturbed employee at a us biolab mailed out anthrax spores across the country, killing five people. two chinese researchers exposed to sars in 2004 spread the disease to others, killing one. in 2014, a handful of smallpox vials were uncovered during an food and drug administration office move. lynn klotz, a senior science fellow at the center for arms control and non-proliferation, has been sounding the alarm for many years about the public safety threats posed by such facilities. ""human errors constitute over 70 percent of the errors in laboratories,"" he told afp, adding that us researchers have to rely on data from freedom of information requests to learn of these incidents. there is disagreement between the us government, which funded bat coronavirus research in wuhan, and some independent scientists, about whether this work was controversial ""gain of function"" (gof) research. gof research entails modifying pathogens to make them more transmissible, deadlier, or better able to evade treatment and vaccines — all to learn how to fight them better. this field has long been contentious.  debate reached a fever pitch when two research teams in 2011 showed they could make bird flu transmissible between mammals. harvard epidemiologist marc lipsitch told afp he was concerned ""that it would create a strain of virus that if it infected a laboratory worker could not just kill that laboratory worker. . .  but also cause a pandemic. """"the research is not required and does not contribute to the development of drugs or vaccines,"" added molecular biologist richard ebright of rutgers university, one of the staunchest opponents of this kind of research. in 2014 the us government announced a pause in federal funding for such work, which gave way in 2017 to a framework that would consider each application on a case-by-case basis. but the process has been criticized as lacking transparency and credibility. as late as last year, a nonprofit received funding from the us on research to ""predict spillover potential"" of bat coronavirus to humans in wuhan. questioned by congress this week, francis collins and anthony fauci of the national institutes of health denied this amounted to gain of function research, but ebright said it clearly does. none of this means that covid-19 definitely leaked from a lab — in fact there is no hard scientific evidence in favor of natural origin or lab accident scenario, said ebright. but there are certain lines of circumstantial evidence in favor of the latter.  for instance, wuhan is around 1,000 miles north of bat caves that harbor the ancestor virus, well out of the animals' flight range. scientists from wuhan were however known to be carrying out routine trips to those caves to take samples. alina chan, a molecular biologist from the broad institute, said there were no signs of risky pathogen research dying down in the wake of the pandemic — in fact ""it's possibly expanded. ""last year, chan published research showing that, unlike sars, sars-cov-2 was not evolving fast when it was first detected in humans — another piece of circumstantial evidence that could point to lab origin. chan considers herself a ""fence-sitter"" on the competing hypotheses, but does not favor banning risky research, fearing it would then go underground. one solution ""might just be as simple as moving these research institutes out into extremely remote areas. . . where you have to quarantine for two weeks before we re-enter in human society,"" she said. — afp © 2006 2021 the online

2021-05-31,Israel inches closer to government without Netanyahu.,"jerusalem: israeli nationalist hardliner naftali bennett said on sunday (may 30) that he would join apotential coalition governmentthat could end the rule of the country's longest-serving leader, prime minister benjamin netanyahu. lawmakers opposed to right-wing netanyahu have been in intense talks ahead of a wednesday deadline, as a ceasefire held following the latestdeadly military conflict with hamasin the gaza strip. netanyahu, 71, who faces trial on fraud, bribery and breach of trust charges, which he denies, has clung to power throughout a period of political turmoil that has seen four inconclusive elections in under two years. a march vote saw netanyahu's likud party gain the most seats, but he again failed to form a government. opposition leader and former tv anchor yair lapid now has until wednesday evening to build a rival coalition. lapid, 57, is seeking a diverse alliance which the israeli media has dubbed a bloc for ""change"", which would include bennett as well as arab-israeli lawmakers. in his determination to bring down the hawkish prime minister, lapid has offered to share power and let bennett, 49, serve the first term in a rotating premiership. bennett, after meeting members of his religious-nationalist yamina party, said on sunday: ""i will do everything to form a national unity government with my friend yair lapid. ""lapid and bennett's parties started talks on sunday night to formalise the deal, they said in a statement. religious-nationalist yamina won seven seats in mar 23 elections, but one member has refused to join an anti-netanyahu coalition. netanyahu, who has been in office for 12 consecutive years after an earlier three-year term, in his own televised address minutes later lashed out at the plan, calling it ""a danger for the security of israel"". ""desperate position""he had earlier on sunday tried to cling to power by offering his own, last-ditch power-sharing agreement to several former allies including bennett. he warned that israel would otherwise be ruled by a dangerous ""left-wing"" alliance. lapid has until 11. 59 pm local time on wednesday (4. 59am on thursday, singapore time) to build a coalition of at least 61 deputies, a majority in the 120-seat knesset. a lapid government would also include the centrist blue and white party of netanyahu's rival benny gantz and the hawkish new hope party of his former ally gideon saar. avigdor lieberman's pro-settlement yisrael beitenu party as well as historically powerful labour and the dovish meretz party would also join. the shaky arrangement would need the backing of some arab-israeli lawmakers of palestinian descent in order to pass a confirmation vote in parliament. the intense talks follow weeks of escalating tensions between israel and the palestinians, including a deadly 11-day exchange of rocket fire from gaza and devastating israeli airstrikes. the war with hamas that ended with a may 21 truce, as well as violence in the occupied west bank and in mixed jewish-arab towns in israel, initially appeared to leave netanyahu more likely to hold onto power. but political scientist gayil talshir at hebrew university told afp on sunday that israel was now ""closer than ever"" to a coalition of change, adding: ""netanyahu is in a desperate position. ""netanyahu's likud party won 30 seats in the march elections, but failed to form a governing coalition after his far-right partners refused to sit with arab factions or receive their support. lapid, whose party won 17 seats, was then given four weeks to form a government. netanyahu had previously pushed for yet another election israel's fifth in a little more than two years. more elections?on sunday, netanyahu offered his own proposal of a rotation agreement with bennett and saar.  but saar on twitter said that he remained committed to ""replacing the netanyahu regime"". netanyahu in a video then called on saar and bennett to ""come now, immediately"" to meet him and join a three-way rotation government, warning that they were in a ""crucial moment for the security, character and future of the state of israel"". lapid's ""change"" coalition also still faced several obstacles. some right-wing lawmakers object to a partnership with politicians from israel's arab minority, who make up about a fifth of the population. the recent gaza conflict sparked inter-communal clashes between jewish and arab israelis in mixed cities. arab politicians have also been divided about joining a government headed by bennett, who supports expanding israeli settlements in the occupied west bank, where palestinians hope to create a state. even with support from an arab party, a new coalition in israel is unlikely to reverse years of israeli settlement construction or bring peace any time soon with hamas in gaza. if the anti-netanyahu camp does not manage to form a government on time, a majority of 61 lawmakers could vote to ask the president to name a new premier. another scenario would see the country return, yet again, to the polls. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-05-31,Sri Lanka questions crew of burning cargo ship crew after marine disaster.,"negombo, sri lanka: criminal investigators in sri lanka began questioning the crew of a burning cargo ship on monday (may 31), as the singapore-registered carrier burned for a 12th straight day in one of the island's worst-ever marine ecological disasters. afire broke out aboard the mv x-press pearl, which was carrying 25 tonnes of nitric acid and a huge amount of plastic raw materials, as it was about to enter colombo harbour on may 20. intense flames, still burning at the rear of the 186m vessel, have destroyed much of the cargo, some of which has fallen into the indian ocean. tonnes of microplastic granules from the ship and its nearly 1,500 containers have inundated sri lanka's famed beaches, forcing a fishing ban and sparking fears of ecological devastation. marine environment protection authority (mepa) chief dharshani lahandapura said they were still assessing the ecological damage, but believed it was the ""worst ever in my lifetime"". the police chief has ordered the criminal investigation department to investigate the fire as well as the huge environmental damage caused, an official said. ""the 25-member crew have completed their quarantine and we are able to question them today,"" a police spokesman said. detectives interviewed the vessel's skipper and chief engineer both russian and its chief officer, an indian, at a hotel where they have been quarantined. ""we have questioned three members of the crew so far and the investigations are ongoing,"" a police spokesman added. ""select seafarers have today been helping local police with their enquiries into the fire and are cooperating with investigators,"" the vessel's operators, x-press feeders, added in a statement. ""we will respect this process and not publicly discuss operational details until the investigation has been completed. ""mepa said the captain of the vessel had known about a nitric acid leak on may 11, long before the vessel entered sri lankan waters. authorities are moving to sue the owners of the vessel and its crew and claim damages from insurers. the fire has been under control since sunday, officials said, adding, however, that the vessel continued to smoke on monday and that high monsoon winds were fanning flames at the back of the ship. they said it was still too hot for them to attempt boarding the stricken ship. international salvage firm smit is leading efforts to douse the flames and is being assisted by sri lanka's navy and the indian coast guard. the three-month-old ship was heading to colombo from gujarat, india. it had previously visited qatar and dubai and was due to go to malaysia and singapore after calling at colombo. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-05-31,"US tyre maker Goodyear faces allegations of labour abuse in Malaysia, documents show.","kuala lumpur: american tyre manufacturer goodyear tire & rubber company is facing accusations of unpaid wages, unlawful overtime and threats to foreign workers at its malaysian factory, according to court documents and complaints filed by workers. in interviews with reuters, six current and former foreign workers, and officials with malaysia's labour department, say that goodyear made wrongful salary deductions, required excessive hours and denied workers full access to their passports. the department confirmed that it had fined goodyear in 2020 for overworking and underpaying foreign employees.  one former worker said that the company illegally kept his passport, showing reuters an acknowledgement letter he signed in january 2020 upon getting it back eight years after he started working at goodyear. the allegations initially surfaced when 185 foreign workers filed three complaints against goodyear malaysia in the country's industrial court, two in 2019 and one in 2020, over non-compliance with a collective labour agreement. the workers alleged that the company was not giving them shift allowances, annual bonuses and pay increases even though these benefits were available to the local staff, who are represented by a labour union. the court ruled in favour of the foreign workers in two of the cases last year, saying that they were entitled to the same rights as malaysian employees, according to copies of the judgement published on the court's website.  goodyear was ordered to pay back wages and comply with the collective agreement, according to the judgement and the workers' lawyer. about 150 worker payslips, which the lawyer said were submitted to the court as evidence of unpaid wages and reviewed by reuters, showed some migrants working as many as 229 hours a month in overtime, exceeding the malaysian limit of 104 hours. the foreign workers are claiming about rm5 million (us$1. 21 million) in unpaid wages, said their lawyer, chandra segaran rajandran.  the workers are from nepal, myanmar and india. ""they are put in a situation where they are being denied their full rights as what is provided for (by law),"" he said, adding that it amounted to ""discrimination"". goodyear, one of the world's largest tyre makers, has challenged both verdicts at the high court.  the appeal decision is expected on jul 26. the verdict for the third case, over the same issues, is due in the coming weeks. goodyear declined to comment on any of the allegations, citing the court process. according to the court ruling last year, goodyear malaysia argued that foreign workers are not entitled to the benefits of the collective agreement because they are not union members. according to the ruling, a union representative testified that foreign workers are eligible to join and are entitled to the benefits in the collective agreement even if they are not members.  the court agreed that the foreign workers' job scope entitled them to those benefits. goodyear told reuters that it has strong policies and practices relating to and protecting human rights. ""we take seriously any allegations of improper behaviour relating to our associates, operations and supply chain,"" a representative said in an email. the union the national union of employees in companies manufacturing rubber products did not respond to reuters' requests for comment on the workers' complaints. goodyear's malaysia operation is jointly owned by the country's largest fund manager, permodalan nasional berhad, which directed queries to goodyear. fines and violationsworkers said that they faced intimidation from goodyear after they filed the lawsuits.  goodyear declined to comment. ""the company had different rules for different sets of workers,"" said sharan kumar rai, who filed one of the lawsuits and worked at goodyear in malaysia from 2012 until last year. the foreign workers filed the first two lawsuits in july 2019.  soon afterwards, goodyear asked some to sign letters, without their lawyer's knowledge, that they would withdraw from the legal action, according to their lawyer, police complaints filed in october 2019 and a copy of the letter seen by reuters. reporting a complaint to police does not always result in criminal charges but can trigger an investigation. industrial court chairman anna ng fui choo said in her ruling that the letter ""was an act of unfair labour practice"". malaysia's labour department told reuters that it had investigated and charged goodyear in 2020 over nine violations of labour laws, unrelated to the lawsuits, regarding excessive hours and wrongful salary deductions.  it fined goodyear rm41,500 (us$10,050), it said. malaysia has in recent years faced accusations from its own ministry of human resources and authorities in the united states of labour abuse at its factories, which rely on millions of migrant workers to manufacture everything from palm oil to medical gloves and iphone components. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-05-31,'We've won the f*cking Champions League!'.,"other english editionsshortly after the full-time whistle blew in porto on saturday night, kai havertz was asked about the massive transfer fee which had appeared to hang heavily around his neck all season long. ""i don't give a f*ck now!"" chelsea's £70 million ($99m) signing told bt sport.  ""we've won the f*cking champions league!""indeed, with his very first goal in the tournament, havertz has already secured legendary status at stamford bridge.  it had been a tough first season in england for the former bayer leverkusen attacker, arguably the toughest of his fledgling career to date.  he arrived touted as the most exciting young player to come out of germany for years but the 21-year-old, perhaps unsurprisingly, took time to get going and sparkled only sporadically. contracting coronavirus hadn't helped his period of adaptation to a new team, club and country, while the manager who signed him, frank lampard, was dismissed midway through the campaign. it was thought that the arrival of thomas tuchel would result in an immediate return to form but havertz was never a certain starter under his fellow german. however, tuchel backed him in the biggest game of the season and havertz came up trumps.  in front of a crowd of 14,000 people at the estadio do dragao, which included chelsea owner roman abramovich, he showed exactly why the blues were so determined to acquire him. darting through the middle of the pitch, havertz latched onto mason mount's through ball and rounded manchester city goalkeeper ederson to score what proved the only goal of a tight and tense all-english champions league final. havertz should have ended the game with an assist, too, but after brilliantly teeing up christian pulisic in the second half, the american dragged his dinked finish wide of the goal.     in the end, it mattered not.  havertz's solitary strike proved sufficient to see off city and he was a deserved match-winner.  he didn't just cause problems in attack, as he also helped out his defence by tracking back repeatedly during the second half.  of course, to beat a pep guardiola side, you need a complete team display and that's what chelsea produced in portugal.  tactically, technically and mentally, they were immaculate throughout, combining quality with work-rate. andreas christensen had to come on for an injured thiago silva and helped deliver yet another clean sheet.  as far as the dane is concerned, tuchel deserves a significant slice of the credit for chelsea's transformation into one of the toughest teams to break down in europe. ""you guys can see he is very passionate on the sidelines,"" christiansen told reporters.  ""also, just the things we are trying to do are more german.  it's hard to explain but it's the feeling you get and is good for me personally. ""he's been trying to get his ideas across, and not just from a defensive perspective.  he's been trying to get loads of ideas in our heads but, at the same time, he doesn't do too much because otherwise, it would get complicated. ""he deserves credit but the players do as well for taking on so much information on board so quickly and making it work. ""it's undoubtedly been a team effort, with the manager and his players performing in unison.  how else to explain their dramatic change of fortune since january? or the fact that they managed to overcome a city side that were heavy favourites to win their first champions league title.    instead, it was chelsea who claimed their second, and deservedly so.  whereas the blues rose to the occasion, the premier league champions panicked. perhaps even guardiola was affected by the pressure.  he once again seemed to overthink his team selection and ended up losing to tuchel for the third time in a row. the former paris saint-germain coach had been hired shortly after city ripped chelsea apart at stamford bridge.  however, in his first meeting with guardiola, he masterminded a 2-1 fa cup semi-final win over the catalan, and followed up with a vital premier league victory at the etihad stadium. this win in porto, though, ranks as the biggest triumph of all, a beautiful testament to the strong bond he so quickly formed with his players. ""he's honest,"" right-back reece james told reporters matter-of-factly.  ""he believes in us and that we can win many trophies and titles together. ""they've now claimed the biggest one of all, and against the man considered the best coach in the game today. tuchel's two previous victories over guardiola had been dismissed by some because the city boss hadn't fielded his strongest line-up in either game. however, with both managers having full panels to choose from at the dragao, tuchel once again came out on top. chelsea claimed the european crown city thought they were destined to win.  now, tuchel's team look perfectly poised to take their english title away from them too.    copyright © 2021 goal (singapore) all rights

2021-05-31,New Zealand hosts Australia's prime minister in first meeting since COVID-19 outbreak.,"christchurch: growing friction with china and how to reopen borders after the pandemic will likely be among the topics discussed by the leaders of australia and new zealand in their first face-to-face meeting since the covid-19 outbreak prompted both countries to close their borders. australian prime minister scott morrison arrived in the tourist resort of queenstown for an overnight visit on sunday (may 30). he greeted his new zealand counterpart jacinda ardern with a traditional maori hongi, in which the pair pressed noses together. morrison is the first major world leader to visit new zealand since both countries shut their borders last year to contain the virus.  the neighbours opened a quarantine-free travel bubble last month, although a recent outbreak of the virus in melbourne has prompted new zealand tosuspend the arrangement with victoria state. morrison's visit came as new zealand was dealing with extensive flooding in the canterbury region following heavy rains.  video footage showed one farmer being rescued by helicopter from a raging river, while other swelling rivers threatened to flood thousands of homes. the choice of queenstown for the meeting was deliberate as new zealand tries to revive its battered tourism industry.  queenstown has been particularly hard-hit by the pandemic, although tourism operators say they expect a boost from australian tourists during the upcoming ski season now the travel bubble has begun. the changing dynamics with china have been a big topic in both countries. australia's relationship with china has deteriorated significantly.  china has blocked some australian exports after australia excluded china-based telecommunications company huawei from its 5g phone network and called for an independent investigation into the origins of the coronavirus. new zealand has also been more outspoken against china on some issues in recent months, although has so far maintained better relations with the superpower than australia. ardern said she would talk with morrison about the pandemic recovery as well as key regional challenges and security issues.

""we are working with malaysia to ensure the continued flow of essential supplies between our two countries,"" said mr gan, speaking at a covid-19 multi-ministry task force. the government has been working closely with relevant agencies and companies to build up existing stock, further diversify its sources of food and essential items while also increasing local production, he said. ""i want to assure everyone that we have ample supply of food and essential items.  but please remember to only buy what you need,"" said mr gan, who is also co-chair of the task force. economic agencies in singapore are working with companies, especially those dealing with essential goods and services, to minimise disruptions to their supply lines, he added. mr gan visited supermarket chain fairprice and home-grown supply chain solutions company ych over the weekend to better understand the measures that have been put in place to ensure that there is sufficient food and essential items for all, he said. describing the covid-19 situation as ""extremely fluid"", mr gan said that as the pandemic continues to evolve globally, singapore must remain prepared and vigilant as a nation while staying flexible and adaptable. speaking after prime minister lee hsien loong's address on singapore's strategy against covid-19, mr gan said that the next few months are ""critical"". ""we are in a race with the virus.  the virus will attempt to spread wider and faster, and therefore we need to do more and do faster too, in vaccination, testing and contact tracing,"" he said. impact expected to be ""modest""touching on the potential impact of the tighter covid-19 restrictions during phase 2 (heightened alert) on singapore's economy, mr gan said that he expects the overall impact to be modest. ""the impact of the measures will differ across different sectors.  domestic, consumer-oriented sectors, such as food and beverage services, retail, and land transport, will see a greater impact,"" he added. ""on the other hand, the impact of these measures on outward-oriented sectors of the economy, such as manufacturing and finance and insurance, is likely to be less severe. ""last friday, finance minister lawrence wong announcedmore support measuresfor businesses affected by the tightened measures, extending wage subsidies to more sectors. ""even as we do our best to manage the situation at hand, mti will continue to give businesses, our full support to help them transform and seize new opportunities when they arise,"" said mr gan. downloadour appor subscribe to our telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:https://cna. asia/telegramit looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-05-31,"B1617 Covid-19 variant infiltrates over 50 countries: 4 reasons why it spreads so easily, Singapore News.","singapore the b1617 covid-19 variant has infiltrated over 50 countries, outcompeted other strains and continues to infect.  it will also not be the last time the virus will mutate, experts cautioned. but what makes this strain, first discovered in india, so good at spreading?dr sebastian maurer-stroh, virus expert and executive director of the bioinformatics institute at the agency for science, technology and research, points out four features that the b1617 strain has in common with successful virus strains. he uses one of the three versions of the b1617 strain- the second b16172 version to show what makes this virus different.  b16172 has appeared to overtake b16171 in local cases as well as those reported globally.  the third version, b16173, is rare. first, a little primer on coronavirus biology.  what you see in the diagram below is the spike protein of a coronavirus the little spikes that give the virus its distinctive shape.   the spike protein is a trimer three subunits joined together.  it is the complex shown in grey.  the green and yellow complexes are two different antibodies that bind to the spike protein.  the coloured circles represent the different mutations in b16172. characteristic 1: the virus' mutations help it to bind more easily with the ace2 receptor. ace2 is short for angiotensin converting enzyme 2, which is a receptor protein in the host cell. ace2 receptors are found in various parts of the body, including respiratory airways, and are used as entry points by the sars-cov-2 virus.   the sars-cov-2 virus gets inside a host cell through its surface spike protein.  the spike protein and the receptors have a specific 3d configuration that enables them to bind to each other.  the virus attaches only to cells that have these receptors. the spike protein attaches to an ace2 receptor in the host cell before being activated by another enzyme. now, let's take a closer look at one of the subunits on the spike protein to see how its mutations have helped.   scientists think the l452r mutation and to a lesser extent the t478k mutation makes it easier for the virus to attach itself to the receptor and thus get inside the cell. if binding to the receptor is easier, the virus can get inside the host cell more easily and infect more cells. but being more infectious does not mean it can make people more ill. a more transmissible strain most often does not have more symptoms or lead to a more severe form of the disease. characteristic 2: decreasing binding to antibodiest478k and certain other mutations which are circled near the yellow antibody probably make the virus less likely to stick to antibodies.  in a full immune response, many types of antibodies work together.   though a decrease in antibody binding has yet to be proven for t478k, correlation was drawn based on existing data.  the e484k mutation found in the b1351 and p1 variants is located in the same region as t478k hence it is likely that there will be a similar effect. even though one mutation could slightly reduce the protection derived from vaccines and prior infections, it is insufficient to remove their utility. vaccination and natural immunity from prior infections are still very effective in reducing the chance of getting infected and spreading the disease, as well as protection against a severe form of the disease even in the case of variants. characteristic 3: a more stable spike protein  the d614g mutation has been very successful in improving spike protein stability and is found in practically all strains of the virus.  d614g results in the spike protein adopting a more open conformation, which gives it more surface area to interact with the ace2 receptor, hence increasing its infectivity. a more stable spike protein can also mean more spike protein expressed on the virus surface, increasing its chances of infecting host cells. d614g has been linked to increased transmissibility and a higher viral load but not increased severity. characteristic 4: improving cleavage ratesthe spike protein needs to be cleaved into two units (called s1 and s2 units) to allow structural changes needed to enter into cells.   the diagram shows the spike protein on the sars-cov-2 virus before cleavage and the right shows what it looks like after the s1 unit has dissociated. mutations like p681r could potentially improve cleavage rates and hence increase infectivity.  this has yet to be confirmed experimentally. this article was first published in the straits times.  permission required for reproduction.

2021-05-31,New Zealand backs Australia in trade spat with China ahead of Ardern-Morrison meeting.,"by lidia kelly(reuters) australia's prime minister scott morrison arrived in new zealand on sunday for high-level talks hours after the country's government chose to support canberra in its dispute with china on barley tariffs, signalling good will to work on differences in how to approach beijing. quarantine-free travel between australia and new zealand began last month after both nations controlled the spread of covid-19, allowing morrison and prime minister jacinda ardern to meet face to face for the first time in 15 months. the talks were likely to be challenged by differences over china, the biggest trading partner of both countries, with australia at loggerheads with beijing and new zealand taking a more accommodating approach. china has in recent months moved to restrict imports of australian products such as barley, wine and beef, with the world trade organisation saying on friday it would establish a dispute settlement panel to resolve the barley row. ahead of morrison's visit, new zealand trade minister damien o'connor said his government was backing canberra in the spat. ""new zealand is participating in this dispute as a third party because it raises systemic issues of importance to the effective functioning of the multilateral rules-based trading system,"" local media cited o'connor as saying. ""new zealand was not asked to join as a third party, however we have been a third party in over 60 wto cases since 1995 and it's not unusual for us to join actions disputes when we see challenges to international trade rules. ""australia's ties with china have sunk to their lowest point in decades in the past 18 months after morrison led calls for a global enquiry into the origins of covid-19 and australia barred chinese tech giant huawei technologies co from its 5g network. new zealand's economic ties with china have been strengthening, with the two countries this year upgrading their free trade agreement. new zealand also said last month it was ""uncomfortable"" with expanding the role of the five eyes, a post-war intelligence grouping that also includes the united states, britain, australia and canada.  this raised speculation that wellington did not back the group's recent criticisms of beijing. china has accused the five eyes of ganging up on it with statements on hong kong and the treatment of muslim uyghurs in xinjiang. formal talks between ardern and morrison, expected to be dominated by china and its growing influence in the region, are to take place on monday.

follow us on instagram and subscribe to our telegram channel for the latest updates on news you need to know. petaling jaya, may 31 — a singapore cafe has apologised for claiming to serve nasi padang ""without the nasties"" in a now-deleted instagram post. the ritual, located on bukit timah road, posted a statement on their instagram over the weekend admitting that the choice of words they used to refer to a ""locally-inspired"" dish was ""inappropriate"" and ""insensitive. """"it failed to articulate our original intentions and our respect for the culture and heritage of nasi padang as a dish. ""it did not align with our team's values and we made the decision to remove it early this morning. ""we are extremely sorry for causing any hurt, anger, or offence,"" read the statement.  a post shared by ∞ theritual ∞ (@theritual. sg) the ritual previously made an instagram post inviting customers to enjoy its nasi padang ""without the nasties"" and indulge in a ""guilt-free"" treat. the caption went on to explain that the dish is made without monosodium glutamate (msg) and additives, and that diners could taste ""indonesian flavours bursting forth minus the guilt. ""indonesians then converged on the cafe's social media to call it out for presenting one of the nation's most iconic foods in a negative light. the ritual's apology has not gone down well either and many have continued to criticise the cafe for its handling of the situation. ""yeah, the nasties being msg, colouring, etc. . .  real nasi padang doesn't have any of those, so which nasi padang have you been eating that contains such things?""i hope you understand why this really was an issue, it's the implication (more) than anything else,"" instagram user @jhotan_ commented. another user also slammed the cafe for failing to do proper research on the culture and cuisine it was lifting its recipes from. ""you can stop adopting any other culture you're unsure of and the first step is to take the nasi padang off your menu, 'cause you don't deserve to serve that in your restaurant,"" said @pandazhar. the nasi padang dish is still available on the ritual's e-menu for sgd21 (rm65) at the time of writing. the cafe initially responded to the backlash on their instagram stories and said that there was no intention to put anyone's culture down with the post. the management also claimed that they simply wanted to create a ""healthier"" version of nasi padang so people with dietary restrictions could savour it as well. nasi padang is one of the best-known dishes of minangkabau cuisine and hails from the west sumatra province of indonesia. it consists of rice with a variety of side dishes which are typically put on display in restaurant windows in towering arrangements of stacked up plates and bowls. loading. . . © 2021, malay mail, all rights reserved.

                    monday, 31 may 2021
                petaling jaya: measures will be taken to ensure that the food supply chain will not be disrupted during the 14-day total lockdown, says the agriculture and food industries ministry. minister datuk seri dr ronald kiandee (pic), in a statement monday (may 31), gave an assurance that follow-up measures and arrangements will be implemented to ensure that all networks and chains in the agriculture and food industry sector, including its ecosystem, will not be affected during the implementation of phase one of the total lockdown. industry players and entrepreneurs involved in the agriculture, fisheries, livestock and plantation sectors have also been advised to contact the nearest department or agency under the ministry to obtain a letter of confirmation, besides having to comply with all standard operating procedures (sops) outlined by the government to curb the spread of covid-19. ""the ministry is committed to ensuring that the food supply chain in malaysia remains at a stable, adequate and controlled level as well as ensuring access is always available to the public,"" the statement read. kiandee also said the ministry estimated that a total of 100,000 to 150,000 metric tonnes of rice will be needed throughout the 14 days of the lockdown, which includes assumptions in the event of panic buying. ""this supply can be met based on the current stock of 764,000 metric tons available at manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers,"" he said. to ensure continuous supply and uninterrupted production of rice, kiandee said the ministry will ensure that the process of cultivation and mill operations will be able to operate at the permitted rate in accordance with sops set by the national security council (nsc). ""this includes permission for the distribution of agricultural input such as fertilisers, rice seeds and the use of 'jentuai' (harvesting machines) during the period,"" he said. kiandee noted that padi cultivation and harvesting are currently under way in several states such as penang, perak, pahang, kelantan and terengganu. the distribution of rice by wholesalers and retailers is also allowed in accordance with sops set by the nsc to ensure that supplies are not affected. kiandee also revealed that the current stock of the country's fish supply is at 185,000 metric tonnes per month compared to the current requirement of 155,000 metric tonnes per month. ""a total of 89 fish markets and 33 fish collection and distribution centres will still operate nationwide during phase one of the lockdown. ""based on data on the supply of livestock commodities, it is expected that the supply of meat, poultry, eggs and milk will also be sufficient,"" he said. to ensure the public's access to food supply needs, kiandee said the ministry, through the federal agriculture marketing authority (fama), has opened 43 controlled fresh market locations nationwide, consisting of 24 permanent farmers' markets, three myfarm outlets, 14 fama operation centres and two agrobazaars, compared to 63 locations that were opened during mco 1. 0 last year. ""this reduction is due to the implementation of tightened sops by nsc to address the third wave transmission of covid-19,"" he said. kiandee called on all agro-food entrepreneurs including farmers, ranchers and fishermen to always abide by the sop and maintain personal health at all times by prioritising the use of face masks, physical distancing and hand hygiene. ""the ministry would like to advise the public not to panic-buy and stockpile food excessively, which can result in situations where there is unequal public access to food supply,"" he added. the public can contact the ministry's operations room at 03 88701663/ 1664/ 1491 or email bilikgerakan@mafi. gov. my to obtain any information or clarification related to the agriculture sector and food industry. to obtain information on activities, operations and sop during phase one of the lockdown, the public can visit https://www. mafi. gov. my/

supply chain in malaysia remains at a stable, adequate and controlled level as well as ensuring access is always available to the public,"" the statement read.', 'kiandee also said the ministry estimated that a total of 100,000 to 150,000 metric tonnes of rice will be needed throughout the 14 days of the lockdown, which includes assumptions in the event of panic buying.', '""this supply can

""now, on my days off, i watch korean dramas or video call my family in the philippines. ""as for my friends in singapore, i keep in contact with them through facebook messenger or whatsapp,"" she said. she is anxious about the current pandemic situation, but she has not been adversely affected by the tightened measures as she can still keep in contact with friends and family and remit money through online payment services like singtel dash. ms denise wang, 20, a member of the family who employs ms agustin, said the helper is comfortable staying home on her days off. ""she has worked with us for 15 years. . .  we also have another helper with whom she gets along well,"" she said. meanwhile, ms agustin's employers have booked an appointment for her to get vaccinated. other domestic helpers said they understood the rationale behind the tightened measures. ms maricel sueta serantes, 50, said: ""we need to cooperate and fight the virus by staying home.  i am okay as long as i am being compensated. ""she usually has sundays off but told her employers that she preferred to stay at home because of the pandemic. ""i haven't had to make many changes, and i still keep in contact with my friends and family through facebook messenger and whatsapp. ""i also do daily exercises when i take my employers an elderly couple out for a walk,"" she said. the centre for domestic employees (cde) has temporarily closed its gathering sites at the amphitheatre @ 20 anderson road, and let's gather @ 99 haig road. however, the centre has moved its activities such as the upcoming may day domestic employee celebrations on june 13 online to engage and support the migrant domestic workers (mdws) community. said cde executive director shamsul kamar: ""we have shared the tightened measures with mdws and encouraged them to stay home as much as possible.  mdws and employers who need advice can always reach out to cde on our 24-hour helpline (1800-2255-233) or through our social media channels and e-mail. ""he added: ""we believe that our mdws understand the need for the tightened measures, and they are cautious of the situation given the recent community cases.

2021-05-31,Taiwan has not 'given up hope' of getting BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine: Health minister.,"taipei: taiwan has not given up hope of eventually getting covid-19 vaccines from germany's biontech, health minister chen shih-chung said on sunday (may 30), a deal that taipei's government has blamed china for not being able to complete. after recording just a handful of daily infections for months, taiwan is dealing with relatively large numbers of community transmissions, though infection rates are starting to fall. it has only vaccinated around 1 per cent of its more than 23 million people but has almost 30 million shots on order, from astrazeneca, moderna and two domestic firms. the chinese-claimed island has blamed beijing for nixing a deal earlier this year for biontech vaccines, which china denies. chen told reporters that although talks for that shot had ""somewhat hit the rocks"", taiwan ""has not completely given up hope"" of obtaining them. shanghai fosun pharmaceutical group co has a contract with biontech to sell the vaccines in greater china, including to taiwan, but taiwan's government says it will only deal with germany's biontech directly and does not trust vaccines from china. outside of greater china, biontech has partnered with pfizer. chen said that in late january, the covax vaccine-sharing scheme for lower-income countries had told taiwan it could get shots from pfizer, but on may 3 covax informed the government that would not be possible. taiwan is under its second-highest level of curbs to stop the spread of infections, including limiting personal gatherings and closing entertainment venues. chen said the task was to ensure those measures were being properly enforced, adding, ""at present there are no plans or intentions for a lockdown. ""the government has come under fire from opposition parties for delays in testing and reporting positive cases, but chen said that was now improving. taiwan reported 355 domestic covid-19 cases on sunday, down from 486 on saturday.  total daily cases peaked on may 17 and have been falling since friday. taiwan has reported 8,160 infections since the pandemic began, including 110 deaths. downloadour appor subscribe to our telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:https://cna. asia/telegramit looks like the email address you entered is not valid.
