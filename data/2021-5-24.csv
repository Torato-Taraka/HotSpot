2020-03-19,"The coronavirus pandemic began in China. Today, it reported no new local infections for the first time","china has reported no new locally transmitted coronavirus cases for the first time since the pandemic began, marking a major turning point in the global battle to contain covid-19.  at a news conference on thursday morning, officials from china's national health commission announced there had been just 34 new cases in the past 24 hours -- all imported from overseas -- and eight new deaths, all in hubei, the province where the virus was first identified.  there were there no new reported cases in hubei at all on wednesday.  the milestone will likely be held up as proof of the ongoing success of china's sweeping, top-down efforts to control the virus, despite persistent allegations that local officials mishandled the initial outbreak.  just last month, mainland china was reporting thousands of new cases every day, and was considered the most high-risk infection area in the world.  in the weeks following the early spread of the virus, the government enacted draconian quarantine measures and strict travel restrictions affecting hundreds of millions of citizens.  in some hard-hit cities, residents have been unable to leave their apartments for more than a month, while transport between major population hubs has been limited or halted altogether.  the unprecedented nature of the measures has exacted a steep toll, however, both on the many millions of ordinary chinese forced to endure life under lockdown and the country's economy, which has seen a steep decline in recent weeks.  beyond china as the danger has lessened in china, the global infection rate continues to accelerate, with countries across multiple continents now grappling with fast-expanding outbreaks of their own.    as of thursday afternoon, the virus had infected more than 218,800 people worldwide, according to johns hopkins university, which is tracking cases reported by the world health organization and additional sources.  that's more than double the total two weeks ago.  in response to the outbreak, democratic countries including italy, france and the philippines have enacted policies similar to those seen in china, placing millions under under full or partial lockdowns.  in response to the global crisis and with the outbreak at home increasingly under control, beijing has begun to send assistance and supplies overseas to countries heavily-affected by the pandemic.  on wednesday, the french foreign ministry announced it had received about a million face masks from the chinese government.  medical teams and supplies from china have also been sent to italy, which has already seen nearly 3,000 deaths from the virus.  at the same time, in light of the spreading virus globally, the chinese government is now rapidly escalating quarantine measures on international arrivals to avoid further outbreaks.  the beijing municipal government announced in state media thursday that all passengers arriving from overseas will need to go into ""collective quarantine at designated facilities. "" beijing residents were previously allowed to quarantine themselves in their own homes.  in the semi-autonomous chinese city of hong kong, dozens of new cases have been confirmed in the past few days as returnees from europe and the us create a second wave of infections.  on tuesday, the city's government issued a red notice for all foreign countries, requiring anyone arriving from overseas to undergo a 14-day home quarantine.  the newly-imported cases come at a bad time for the chinese government as it attempts to restart the country's economy.   new economic data released on monday showed the chinese economy was hit severely by the coronavirus outbreak, with retail sales plunging 20. 5% compared to a year earlier, according to the national bureau of statistics.  at the same time, industrial output also fell 13. 5% during the same period, while fixed asset investment plunged 24. 5%.

2020-07-10,Major Philippines broadcaster denied license as watchdogs warn over press freedom,"lawmakers in the philippines have voted against granting a new license to one of the country's largest and most influential broadcasting networks, a move that critics say will undermine press freedom.  a legislative committee voted overwhelmingly on friday to not renew the franchise of media company abs-cbn, which known for its unflinching coverage of president rodrigo duterte.  the vote comes after lawmakers allowed the media conglomerate's previous license to expire in may, forcing it off the air.  abs-cbn has 24 hours to appeal the decision -- but allies of duterte control both houses of the legislature.  founded in 1953, abs-cbn is one of the most-watched television stations in the philippines, providing both news and entertainment programs.  it operates dozens of television and radio stations and employs about 11,000 people.  media watchdogs and human rights groups condemned the decision, describing it as an assault on press freedom and comparing it to a campaign against the media by former philippine dictator ferdinand marcos in the 1970s.  ""this is a black day for media freedom in a country previously regarded as a bastion of press freedom and democracy in the region,"" phil robertson, deputy asia director at human rights watch, said in a statement.  the foreign correspondents association of the philippines (focap) said the decision ""deprives the filipino people of an independent source of information when millions are grappling with the coronavirus pandemic. "" ""focap was founded during the dark days of martial law in 1974 to safeguard press freedom.  the threats have never ceased and we will never flinch and never cower,"" the group added.  senator risa hontiveros, an opposition lawmaker, said in a statement that the decision sets a ""dangerous precedent"" and is essentially the ""death knell on press freedom in the country. "" since becoming president in june 2016, duterte has repeatedly threatened and disparaged the country's media, accusing outlets of creating ""fake news"" and referring to journalists as ""spies"" and ""sons of bitches. "" abs-cbn has come under particular attack, owing to its critical coverage of duterte's brutal ""war on drugs,"" which has resulted in the death of more than 6,600 people since it began in june 2016, according to police records.  duterte has frequently threatened to take abs-cbn off the air, including during a swearing-in ceremony in november 2019 when he said they would be ""out"" in 2020, according to cnn philippines.  ""if you are expecting [a renewal], i'm sorry.  you're out.  i will see to it that you're out,"" duterte said at the time.  in an interview earlier this year with the philippines tv network abs news channel (anc), presidential spokesperson harry roque downplayed the role of the president's office in the media company's problems.  ""he really is neutral and [wants] to let all his allies know that he will not hold it against them.  it will not endear him either way.  they can vote as they wish,"" he said.  abs-cbn president and ceo carlo katigbak said friday that he was ""deeply hurt"" by the decision made by lawmakers.   ""we remain committed to public service, and we hope to find other ways to achieve our mission,"" he said in a statement reported by the company's news division.  abs-cbn is not the first news organization to experience trouble under the duterte administration.  maria ressa, the ceo of upstart media company rappler, was found guilty of ""cyber libel"" last month, in a case she and press freedom groups have described as a politically motivated prosecution by the duterte government.  rappler's extensive reporting on the philippines under duterte has made the site — and its journalists — targets of his supporters.   ""if you're a reporter in the philippines, this is part of daily life.  it's like pollution in the air,"" ressa said in a recent interview with cnn.  — charles riley contributed reporting from london.

2020-05-30,May 30 coronavirus news,"our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic has moved here.  extremely vulnerable people who have been ""shielding"" in great britain — staying at home at all times and avoiding any face-to-face contact — will be allowed outdoors from monday, the uk government said in a statement ahead of the official announcement on sunday.   communities secretary robert jenrick will announce that 2. 2 million clinically extremely vulnerable people will be able to go outside with members of their household, while continuing to follow social distancing guidelines, according to the government statement.  the updated guidance says those who live alone can meet outside with one other person from another household.  this is seen as a boon for the most clinically vulnerable, including many who have not had any face-to-face contact since they were first advised to shield 10 weeks ago.  however, it comes at a time when members of the scientific advisory board to the uk government – sage – are warning that a premature easing of the coronavirus lockdown could lead to a ""significant"" number of new cases and deaths across the country.  london mayor sadiq khan also on saturday urged citizens to ""act with caution"" as the government prepares to relax lockdown measures on monday, expressing his concerns that the country is ""rushing"" to ease restrictions.  however, the government advised those shielding: ""the average chance of catching the virus is now down from 1/40 to 1/1000, delivering greater reassurance that it is safe to cautiously reflect this in the guidance for those who have been advised to shield. "" it added that people who are shielding should remain at a two-meter distance from others when outside, should only leave the house once a day and should not go to work or the shops.  they should also avoid crowded places where they can't social distance.   ""i want to thank everyone who has followed the shielding guidance – it is because of your patience and sacrifice that thousands of lives have been saved,"" prime minister boris johnson said.  ""i do not underestimate just how difficult it has been for you, staying at home for the last 10 weeks, and i want to pay tribute to your resilience. "" johnson thanked those who have helped deliver medicine and shopping or checked in on people who are isolating.  ""we have been looking at how we can make life easier for our most vulnerable, so . . .  i am happy to confirm that those who are shielding will be able to spend time outside with someone else, observing social distance guidelines,"" johnson said.  ""i will do what i can, in line with the scientific advice, to continue making life easier for you over the coming weeks and months. "" ""thanks to the sacrifices made across the country, which have protected the nhs and saved lives, it's now time to begin lifting restrictions, step by step, and while we must all stay alert, we can now start to resume a sense of normality,"" health secretary matt hancock said.  during his speech at the government's daily press conference on sunday, jenrick is expected to set out a plan to review shielding guidance at the same time as the government reviews its social distancing measures.  the next review will take place later this month.    ##the future## the number of confirmed covid-19 cases in peru rose to 155,671 on saturday, a jump of 7,386 from the previous day, according to the country's health ministry.   the country reported 141 new coronavirus-related deaths, taking the national death toll to 4,371, according to the ministry.  peru has the second-highest number of confirmed covid-19 cases in latin america, behind brazil.  ##cases## new york gov.  andrew cuomo has signed a bill that gives death benefits to families of frontline workers who died battling the coronavirus pandemic.  ""it is the least we can do to say thank you, and we honor you, and we remember you.  you gave your lives for us.  we will be there to support your families going forward,"" cuomo said at a news conference on saturday.  ""we grieve for your loss, and we will always be there for you the way you were there for us.  thank you,"" the governor added.  at least five regions in upstate new york have entered phase two as of friday, gov.  andrew cuomo said during his covid-19 news briefing saturday.  next week, the capital region and western new york will end 14 days of being in phase one and will have to make a decision if they will move to phase two of the reopening, the governor said.  ""we made that decision by reviewing the data and the numbers,"" cuomo said.  new york city mayor bill de blasio was asked to what extent he expects a rise in covid-19 cases as a result of the demonstrations and large gatherings around the city.  ""i would still wish that everyone would realize that when people gather it's inherently dangerous in the context of this pandemic and i'm going to keep urging people not to use that approach and if they do they focus on social distancing and wearing face coverings,"" de blasio said in a news briefing today.  de blasio said ""you cannot see overt racism, you cannot see overt racist murder and not feel something profoundly deep, so i understand that. "" ""but the last thing we would want to see is members of our community harmed because the virus spread in one of these settings,"" de blasio said.  ""it's a very very complicated reality. "" ##cases## at least 67 people in new york state have died from coronavirus on friday – the same number as the day before.  ""overall, that has been tremendous, tremendous progress from where we were,"" gov.  andrew cuomo said at a news conference on saturday.  the number of total hospitalizations, new hospitalizations and intubations have all decreased, cuomo said.  ""that is all good news,"" he said.  ##new york## ##cases## the number of coronavirus patients hospitalized in france continues to decline, according to figures released by the french health ministry on saturday.    there are currently 14,380 hospital patients with the virus, a decrease of 315 from friday, the ministry said.  the statement said the number of covid-19 hospital deaths has risen by 57 from friday.  france has reported 28,717 coronavirus-related deaths in total, according to a tally from johns hopkins university.  ##cases## at least 215 people died from coronavirus in the united kingdom in the past 24 hours, bringing the death toll to approximately 38,376, according to uk culture secretary oliver dowden.  dowden, speaking at the daily downing street press conference on saturday, said roughly 127,722 tests were carried out on friday.   ##cases## the centers for disease control and prevention will resume its regular briefings as the administration continues its coronavirus response, cnn has learned.  the cdc held a briefing friday in which director robert redfield said the agency was ""never blind"" to the early spread of the coronavirus in the united states.  that session was the first of the resumption of the regular press briefings, a senior health and human services official told cnn.  some context: the last of the regular briefings was on march 9.  that is a short time after a top cdc official, dr.  nancy messonier, the agency's director of the national center for immunization and respiratory diseases, surprised the trump administration by predicting the coronavirus would be spreading more rapidly at a time when the white house was downplaying the seriousness of it.   her comments sent the stock market tumbling and in turn, angered president trump.  the move comes as the white house has been under fire recently for sidelining the administration's health experts on its own coronavirus task force.  the doctors, including deborah birx and anthony fauci, have appeared less and less as the country begins to reopen, despite fears of a potential resurgence.    the spanish government said saturday that it would further relax coronavirus restrictions in certain areas from monday.  four islands will lead the way by embarking on phase 3 of the government's de-escalation plan, the government said.  they are la gomera, el hierro and la graciosa, in the canaries, and formentera, in the balearic islands -- all well-known tourist destinations in spain.  phase 3 seeks to allow a transition into relatively normal activities, including attending cinemas, theaters, restaurants and circuses, as long as establishments limit capacity.  people may sit by the bar and there won't be time restrictions by age group any more.  however, most of the islands in both archipelagos will remain on phase 2, together with 70% of mainland spain, which is expected to remain on phase 2 until june 8.   some relaxation of measures was announced saturday for those regions under phase 2: indoor sporting venues are allowed to open at very limited capacity with rigorous hygiene protocols.  swimming pools may open at very limited capacity, with a two-meter requirement between swimmers.   the government also offered some respite for a number of regions still under phase 1, including capital city madrid.  residents will be allowed visits to parks and restricted indoor sports activities.  open-air terraces are also allowed to reopen but not at full capacity.  london mayor sadiq khan has urged citizens to ""act with caution"" as the uk government prepares to ease lockdown measures on monday.  ""i am deeply concerned we are now rushing too fast to lift lockdown measures,"" khan tweeted saturday.  ""the joint biosecurity centre has said we're not ready to move from level 4 to 3, and the 5 tests are not met.  i urge londoners to act with caution -- lives depend on it,"" he said.   earlier on saturday, members of the scientific advisory board to the uk government -- sage -- warned that a premature easing of the coronavirus lockdown could lead to a ""significant"" number of new cases and deaths across the country.   speaking to sky news on saturday, sage adviser and epidemiologist professor john edmunds said that the easing of the lockdown would be ""risky"" and warned that a relaxation of containment measures could lead to some 8,000 new cases of coronavirus every day.  ""significant numbers of cases, unfortunately, means we will get deaths,"" he said.   ##lockdowns#   german chancellor angela merkel ""cannot confirm"" that she will attend a possible g7 summit of world leaders in washington amid the coronavirus pandemic, a spokesperson at the chancellery said saturday.  us president donald trump has said the summit could be held in washington in late june.  ""the chancellor thanks president trump for his invitation to the g7 summit in washington at the end of june,"" merkel's spokesperson said in a statement.   ""as of today, given the overall pandemic situation, she cannot confirm her personal participation, that is, a trip to washington,"" the spokesperson added.  meanwhile, germany's health minister, jens spahn, expressed his ""disappointment"" over the united states' withdrawal from the world health organization, saying that the decision taken by the trump administration was a ""setback"" for international health policy.  some context: canadian prime minister justin trudeau said on wednesday he could not yet commit to attending the proposed g7 meeting in person because of concerns over transmission of the virus and canada's quarantine rules.  french president emmanuel macron spoke with trump on thursday.  the two leaders ""agreed on the importance of convening the g7 in person in the near future,"" according to a white house readout of the call.  but the white house did not say whether macron had committed to attending in person.  at least 102,836 people have died in the us from coronavirus, according to johns hopkins university, with at least 1,747,087 cases recorded across the country.  on saturday, johns hopkins reported 1,068 new cases and 27 reported deaths.   the totals include cases from all 50 states, the district of columbia and other us territories, as well as repatriated cases.   the us has the highest number of deaths and cases globally.  cnn is tracking covid-19's spread across the nation here.  ##cases## for months, latin america watched the rest of the world suffer as the coronavirus spread.  it is a spectator no longer.  ""this is the new epicenter,"" said dr.  marcos espinal, director of communicable diseases at the pan american health organization.  months after emerging from a relatively obscure chinese province, the eye of this viral storm has firmly landed in latin america.  there are roughly 920,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and nearly 50,000 deaths across the region's 33 countries, but those numbers are fast on the rise.  as new deaths and cases fall in the united states, europe and asia, latin america now stands as the world's sole region where the outbreak is unequivocally reaching new heights.  ""in many ways this is no surprise,"" said dr.  ana diez roux, dean of drexel university's school of public health.  ""it was predictable that this was going to happen. "" read the full story here.  japan's health ministry announced 75 new coronavirus cases and 12 deaths for friday -- the fourth consecutive day that the country has seen a rise in coronavirus cases since fully lifting its state of emergency.   this brings the number of total covid-19 cases in japan to 17,516 (16,804 on land and 712 from the diamond princess cruise ship), and its death toll stands at 899 (886 on land and 13 on the ship).  the southern city of kitakyushu reported 26 new infections on friday, where clusters of infection were traced to elderly care homes and hospitals.  the city has reported 69 new cases in the past week.   in tokyo, 22 new infections and three deaths were reported on friday, marking a clear upward trend.   prime minister shinzo abe lifted the state of emergency for all of japan on monday.  much of the country had already eased restrictions except for tokyo and four other prefectures.   two newly assigned us forces korea (usfk) service members tested positive for covid-19 upon their arrival in south korea from the united states on a us government-chartered flight, usfk said in a statement.   the pair arrived at osan air base on may 27, and were in mandatory quarantine at camp humphreys' dedicated barracks while awaiting the results of their covid-19 tests.  the soldiers are being treated in the isolation barracks at camp humphreys, which is designated for confirmed covid-19 cases.  a troop of monkeys snatched the blood samples of suspected coronavirus patients at a government hospital in the meerut district of the north indian state of uttar pradesh.  the incident happened on thursday when a lab assistant working with the hospital's covid-19 facility was carrying samples due for testing, dr dheeraj baliyan, medical superintendent of lala lajpat rai memorial medical college and hospital, told cnn.  the monkeys attacked the lab assistant and stole a box containing three samples, baliyan added.  s. k.  garg, head of the hospital, told a local newswire that the samples were blood samples, and not the swabs usually taken to test for covid-19.  garg said the samples belonged to people who had tested positive for covid-19, but were taken as part of routine blood tests for the patients.  the monkeys climbed the trees with the samples and threw them after chewing the packets, baliyan added.  read more here:  a person who partied in the lake of the ozarks, missouri, area on memorial day weekend has tested positive for coronavirus -- and was possibly infectious over the holiday.  the boone county resident visited multiple bars on may 24 and 25, according to the camden county health department.  they ""developed (the) illness"" on sunday, may 24, and was possibly infectious before then.  video from that weekend shows people crowded in a pool at backwater jacks bar and grill in osage beach on saturday, according to scott pasmore, an anchor for cnn affiliate ktvk, who shot the footage.  the partier went to backwater jacks between about 1 p. m.  and 5 p. m.  local time and again shortly before 10 p. m. , according to health officials.  the person -- who was not identified -- also went to shady gators and lazy gators and buffalo wild wings, officials added.  a 5-4 supreme court ruling has rejected a request from a california church to block limitations on the number of people who could attend religious services during the coronavirus pandemic.   chief justice john roberts sided with the liberals on the bench, and wrote separately to explain his vote.   ""although california's guidelines place restrictions on places of worship, those restrictions appear consistent with the free exercise clause of the first amendment,"" roberts wrote.  
""similar or more severe restrictions apply to comparable secular gatherings, including lectures, concerts, movie showings, spectator sports, and theatrical performances, where large groups of people gather in close proximity for extended periods of time. "" the thrust to reopen churches has become one of the latest debates in the coronavirus culture wars.  as states across the country have been gradually reopening their cities, some churches have argued that they are being treated differently than other businesses or groups.   justices clarence thomas, samuel alito, neil gorsuch and brett kavanaugh would have granted the church's request.   kavanaugh, writing for thomas and gorsuch, said the church would suffer ""irreparable harm from not being able to hold services on pentecost sunday in a way that comparable secular businesses and persons can conduct their activities. "" wuhan was the original epicenter.  then the coronavirus migrated to europe.  new york was the next hotspot, and now world health authorities are worried about south america.  the region as a whole is reporting more daily cases than the united states.  and politics, rather than policy, seems to have informed the very different approaches that various south american countries have taken -- with ideology appearing to have trumped best medical practices in some cases.  in mexico, president andrés manuel lópez obrador says he will resume travel around the country to kick off important public works projects, including a new railway in the southeast.  in brazil, president jair bolsonaro defied his country's own medical authorities by participating in multiple rallies supporting his government.  the right-wing former military officer was even shaking hands with supporters and holding children in his arms.   and in nicaragua, president daniel ortega has turned the coronavirus pandemic into a political issue, saying his opponents are the ones who want people to stay home to create a financial crisis, undermining the country and his government.  read more here: there are now at least 1,746,019 cases of coronavirus in the us, according to johns hopkins university's tally, with 102,809 total deaths.  on friday, johns hopkins university reported 24,266 new cases and 1,193 deaths.   the totals include cases from all 50 states, the district of columbia and other us territories, as well as repatriated cases.   when the world looked to asia for successful examples in handling the novel coronavirus outbreak, most eyes were on south korea, taiwan and hong kong.  but there's one overlooked success story -- vietnam.   the country of 97 million people is yet to report a single coronavirus-related death, and on saturday had just 328 confirmed cases, despite its long border with china and the millions of chinese visitors it receives each year.  this is all the more remarkable considering vietnam is a low-middle income country with a much less advanced health care system than others in the region.  it only has eight doctors for every 10,000 people, a third of the ratio in south korea, according to the world bank.  after a three-week nationwide lockdown, vietnam lifted social distancing rules in late april.  it hasn't reported any local infections for more than 40 days.  businesses and schools have reopened, and life is gradually returning to normal.  to skeptics, vietnam's official numbers may seem too good to be true.  but guy thwaites, an infectious disease doctor who works in one of the main hospitals designated by the vietnamese government to treat covid-19 patients, said the numbers matched the reality on the ground.  ""i go to the wards every day, i know the cases, i know there has been no death,"" said thwaites, who also heads the oxford university clinical research unit in ho chi minh city.  read more here: us withdraws from the who: president donald trump announced that the us would pull out of the world health organization after criticizing its response to the coronavirus pandemic and relationship with china.  medical groups including the american academy of pediatrics warned the decision could endanger global health. 
south america cases rise: brazil recorded its highest daily increase yet, with 26,928 new infections in 24 hours, while peru announced at least 6,500 new cases.  brazil's 27,878 coronavirus deaths are the fifth highest of any country, leapfrogging spain. 
mexico's death toll nears 10,000: 371 more coronavirus deaths on friday has pushed mexico's total fatalities to 9,415.  there were 3,227 new confirmed infections over the same period, coming as the mexican government announced it would begin to reopen parts of its economy next week. 
did pangolins incubate the coronavirus?: a new study into the genetics of the novel coronavirus has shown the disease spent some time jumping between bats and pangolins before it first spread to humans.  but researchers said it still isn't clear which species was responsible for the first human infections, adding it could be third species.  mexico recorded 3,227 new coronavirus cases and 371 additional virus deaths on friday.   the country's death toll, now at 9,415, has roughly doubled in the last two weeks and remains the second-highest in latin america, behind brazil.   mexico is likely to surpass 10,000 coronavirus deaths this weekend.  its total confirmed case count is now 84,627.    the government will start reopening limited sections of the economy in select parts of the country on monday.  a deep dive into the genetics of the novel coronavirus shows it seems to have spent some time infecting both bats and pangolins before it jumped into humans, researchers said friday.  pangolins, also known as scaly anteaters, are sold as food in china and have been a prime suspect as a possible source of the pandemic.   yet the researchers said it's too soon to blame pangolins for the pandemic and a third animal species may have played host to the virus before it spilled over to people.  what is clear is that the coronavirus has swapped genes repeatedly with similar strains infecting bats, pangolins and a possible third species, a team at duke university, los alamos national laboratory and elsewhere reported in the journal science advances.  what's also clear is that people need to reduce contact with wild animals that can transmit new infections, they concluded.  the team analyzed 43 complete genomes from three strains of coronaviruses that infect bats and pangolins and that resemble the new covid-19 virus.  ""in our study, we demonstrated that indeed sars-cov-2 has a rich evolutionary history that included a reshuffling of genetic material between bat and pangolin coronavirus before it acquired its ability to jump to humans,"" said elena giorgi, a staff scientist at los alamos national laboratory who worked on the study.  but their findings may let pangolins off the hook.   ""the currently sampled pangolin coronaviruses are too divergent from sars-cov-2 to be its recent progenitors,"" the researchers wrote.  combinations of antivirals, anti-inflammatories and other drugs will likely be needed to treat people with coronavirus, a team of us food and drug administration scientists said friday.  it might even be necessary to customize treatment patient by patient, the fda team said in a review of the treatments being tested against covid-19.  ""as the results of clinical trials become available, it may become increasingly clear that there is likely no single magic bullet to resolve the disease but a combination of several interventions that target different key factors of covid-19 may well be required,"" fda drug researcher montserrat puig and colleagues wrote in a report published in frontiers of immunology.   ""until vaccines and targeted drugs for covid-19 are available, there may be a need to intervene with personalized therapeutic approaches.  we are learning day after day, that patients may be affected by sars-cov-2 differently and that many factors influence the outcome of the disease. "" they reviewed 30 different drugs, including those designed to stop the virus from getting into cells, such as already-approved blood pressure drugs; drugs aimed at stopping the virus from replicating, such as the immune suppressors sirolimus and the antiparasitic drug ivermectin; drugs that control the immune system response, such as type 1 interferon; and drugs meant to block the overwrought inflammatory response to the virus, which include some rheumatoid arthritis drugs.  different drugs could help people at different stages of the disease.  early on, it could be enough to stop the virus from getting into cells and replicating itself, puig said.  in patients with more severe disease, it will be more important to intervene in the body's immune response to infection, which can include an overreaction known as the cytokine storm.  no drug is approved to specifically treat coronavirus infections, although the fda has given emergency use authorization to the antiviral drug remdesivir.   being sick with covid-19 around the time you undergo surgery has been linked with an increased risk of complications and death in a new study.  the study, published in the medical journal the lancet on friday, found that among patients who had surgery for various reasons this year and were also diagnosed with covid-19 around the same time, about a quarter died and half experienced complications relating to their lungs.  the study, conduced by an international team of researchers, included data on 969 patients who had surgery between january and march 31 at 235 different hospitals across 24 countries, and who also were diagnosed with covid-19 either before or after their surgery.   almost 24% of those patients died within a month after their surgery.  more than half experienced complications relating to their lungs.  the researchers noted that men 70 and older who had emergency or major elective surgery were found to be at a particularly high risk of death.  it's not clear why there seems to be an association between covid-19 and a risk of lung-related complications after surgery, the researchers said.  it might be important to be careful about who has surgery during the pandemic, they added.  ""although the risks associated with covid-19 need to be carefully balanced against the risks of delaying surgery for every individual patient, our study suggests that the thresholds for surgery should be raised, compared to normal practice,"" aneel bhangu of the university of birmingham in the uk, who worked on the study, said in statement.  ""medical teams should consider postponing non-critical procedures and promoting other treatment options, which may delay the need for surgery or sometimes avoid it altogether. "" brazil recorded 1,124 new coronavirus-related deaths in 24 hours, according to the country's health ministry, raising its overall death toll to 27,878.  the new fatalities pushed brazil's nationwide death toll past that of spain, which has reported 27,121 covid-19 deaths, according to johns hopkins university.  brazil also reported 26,928 fresh cases of the novel coronavirus, another record high for the country, bringing the nationwide total to 465,166.  friday is the fourth day in a row that brazil has recorded more than 1,000 deaths in a day.  washington gov.  jay inslee said the state's stay-at-home order will be allowed to expire on sunday.  ""under this approach, counties will have more flexibility to demonstrate that they have the capability to stay on top of the virus,"" inslee said at a news conference friday.  the earliest coronavirus hotspots in the united states were in washington, but inslee said enough progress has been made to allow more activities.  ""this does not mean, obviously, that we're returning to normal,"" inslee said.  ""it means that, three months to the day after we declared a state of emergency, we're successfully moving forward. "" inslee said counties with few cases may be able to move into phase three soon, but the earliest date would be june 3.  nba commissioner adam silver and the league's board of governors are considering four possible scenarios to restart the suspended season.  espn's adrian wojnarowski and the athletic's shams charania are reporting that silver presented the options on friday that owners will need to decide on before approaching the players union.  both wojnarowski and charania, quoting unnamed sources, outlined four similar options: 16 teams head straight to the playoffs
20 teams play a world cup-like playoff tournament
22 total teams, with some having to play into a post-season tournament
all 30 teams return to finish a shortened 72-game regular season followed by playoffs espn's wojnarowski says the board of governors will vote on the proposals thursday.  charania said silver is targeting a july 31 restart date.  asked about the reports, the nba did not have a comment.  us president donald trump again claimed without evidence that the coronavirus is ""going away"" – and there may even be a cure on the horizon.   in response to geoff ballotti of wyndham hotels speaking about consumers feeling comfortable traveling again, the president repeated one of his favorite refrains throughout the coronavirus pandemic, saying that the virus is ""going away. ""  on the possibility of a cure, trump said ""it won't be in the long distance. "" some background: many scientists around the world are frantically working on therapeutics, vaccines and potential treatments.   no one knows when, or even if, any of them will pan out – or when the virus will no longer be a threat, let alone ""disappear. "" experts have also said that at the very least, the coronavirus will enter the mix of viruses that make people sick every year.   sea world will reopen on june 10, and walt disney world will begin the reopening process on july 11, according to correspondence from florida's department of business and professional regulation.  orange county mayor jerry demings submitted an endorsement to the state after both parks presented reopening plans to the orange county economic recovery task force wednesday.

2021-02-02,"Asian-Americans' disposable income was up 314% before Covid-19, study finds","the collective buying power of asian americans far outpaced other demographic groups over the past 20 years and was on track to reach $1. 3 trillion in 2022 before the covid-19 pandemic hit us shores, according to a newly-unveiled nielsen study.  higher rates of immigration and higher-than-average incomes were key factors in the rise of asian americans' economic strength, according to findings recently highlighted in a series of nielsen 2020 consumer reports on levels of disposable income among black, latinx and asian americans.  the analytics company estimates that prior to the pandemic, the total buying power of black americans was on track to reach $1. 8 trillion by 2024.  latinx buying power was projected to reach $2. 3 trillion by the same year.   nielsen defines buying power as the collective disposable income a group has after taxes.   the company's researchers used us census criteria to define asian americans as individuals with ethnic origins stemming from countries including cambodia, china, india, japan, korea, malaysia, pakistan, the philippines, thailand, and vietnam.  the study's authors found asian-american buying power rose a whopping 314% between 2000 and 2019, greatly exceeding the buying power increase of all other racial and ethnic categories over the same period even though they only represented about 6% of the us population at the end of the study period.  asian americans' closest rival was non-hispanic whites, whose buying power increased by 119% during the same span.  surging populations the rapid rise in immigrants from asian countries has played a major role in their buying-power surge, according to nielsen.  there were 23. 1 million asian-americans and pacific islanders (aapi's) living in the united states in 2019, a population increase of 46% over the previous decade.  the total us population grew by only 8% over the same span, according to nielsen.  the population of non-hispanic whites declined by 1% during that time.  the asian-american population is expected to increase an additional 21% by 2025, according to us census data cited by nielsen.  asian migrants first surpassed hispanics as the largest us immigration group in 2012, according to pew research.  nielsen said asian immigration has increased 91% since 2000 with china and india being the top two sources for asian immigrants to america.  ""asian americans represent the fastest growing ethnic group in america,"" nielseniq global marketing vice president mariko carpenter told cnn business during a pair of recent interviews.  ""population-wise, we almost doubled. ""  higher incomes nielsen's research also shows asian americans are overrepresented in high-earning science, technology, engineering and mathematics related fields.  ""we have 23% of the working population of asian-american professionals that work in stem,"" carpenter said.  ""you have 12% in some of the medical fields.  we tend to also be in professions that are high income, which contributes to the buying power. "" but asian americans are also the demographic group that has the biggest disparity in wealth, according to carpenter and the us pan asian american chamber of education foundation.  the group's president, susan allen, said it remains unclear how much damage the covid-19 pandemic has done to asian americans' collective buying power.  last summer, coronavirus-related hospitality industry shutdowns caused the asian-american unemployment rate to rise from 2. 5% in february to 13. 8% in june, a surge of more than 450%, according to the us department of labor.  ""many asian businesses have really gone down badly,"" allen told cnn business.  ""those who are owning the restaurants, retail stores, nail salons and the very basic community-based businesses, they are the ones who have suffered greatly. "" outsized influence nielsen's report said the rise in asian-american buying power and their outsize influence on us consumer behavior through online gaming communities and social media make the demographic group an ideal target for marketers looking to maximize results for their advertising and publicity campaigns.  carpenter highlighted the influence of south korean k-pop fans on twitter to emphasize her point.  twitter data shows that k-pop lovers posted 6. 1 billion tweets in 2019.  in 2020, fans of korean boy bands such as bts became infamous for co-opting anti-black lives matter hashtags including #whitelivesmatter, #whiteoutwednesday and #bluelivesmatter by flooding them with memes and videos of their favorite k-pop groups.  ""asian americans are 21% more likely to use social media to support companies and brands,"" carpenter told cnn business.  ""we are pace setters when it comes to technology, adoption and really shaping brands.

2021-02-26,Alibaba is back in Beijing's good books for helping to fix poverty,"jack ma's tech empire may still be facing tough new regulations in china, but alibaba seems to have won at least a little bit of favor this week from president xi jinping.  alibaba was one of hundreds of companies that xi commended on thursday during a ceremony intended to bolster his years-long campaign to wipe out extreme poverty in the country.   alibaba is a ""model"" of ""national poverty alleviation,"" according to the certificate it received from the government.  the company posted the certification on its weibo account.  the company also received kudos for its efforts from chinese state media, which this week called attention to alibaba's efforts to help farmers sell some $155 billion worth of agricultural products through its e-commerce websites in support of xi's campaign.  state-run china youth daily published a report on wednesday praising the company for its innovations, such as using ai algorithms to help farmers raise chicken, helping people sell agricultural products through live-streaming, providing education and training to poor women in the countryside, and extending loans to rural regions through its online banking services.  the government-backed praise is welcome news for alibaba and ma, which for months have been caught up in an intensifying crackdown by beijing on the country's tech sector, including an anti-trust investigation.   the e-commerce giant's financial tech affiliate, ant group, is also expected to undergo major restructuring to satisfy regulators who are concerned about its vast reach in digital payments and finance.  ant's highly anticipated ipo was called off late last year after ma criticized chinese regulators.  the criticism of ma in particular — who had not been seen in public for months before he briefly reemerged in january — even appeared to make its way into state media.  last month, he was left off a list of major chinese business leaders compiled by the shanghai securities journal.   and late last year, the people's daily — the mouthpiece of the chinese communist party — published an opinion piece urging tech firms to take more responsibility and focus less on short-term results.  ""internet giants with massive amounts of data and advanced algorithms should have more responsibility, more aspirations, and more accomplishments in technological innovation,"" the piece read.  alibaba ""is privileged to have participated in [the anti-poverty campaign],"" alibaba wrote in a weibo post thursday.  toeing the party line has a lot of benefits for alibaba.  xi made clear last september that he expected private companies to support the work of the communist party.  tech firms contributing to xi's anti-poverty campaign are fulfilling their obligation of ""serving the state,"" according to alex capri, a research fellow at hinrich foundation and a visiting senior fellow at national university of singapore.  ""this reflects well upon the party and wins support,"" he added.  ""as long as big tech is seen to be in proper alignment with the [party's] nationalist message, they will be spared further public chastisement. "" even so, capri cautioned that the praise for alibaba this week ""is not a contradiction of the chinese communist party's hard line against big tech. "" he still expects that the government will continue its crackdown, which is fueled by concerns that tech firms have too much influence over china's financial system.  several media outlets have reported that ant, for example, has agreed with authorities to become a financial holding company — a move that could force it to scale down its aspirations to be a dominant force in the tech world.  — jill disis contributed to this report.

2017-08-07,US calls for legally binding code of conduct in South China Sea,"the us, australia and japan have promised to continue ""freedom of navigation"" operations in the south china sea and called on beijing to endorse a legally binding code of conduct over the disputed region.   in a joint statement following a meeting monday of us secretary of state rex tillerson and his australian and japanese counterparts, the three officials ""expressed serious concerns over maritime disputes in the south china sea. "" china claims almost all of the south china sea, and has heavily militarized some islands in the region and expanded other territories with major land reclamation work, turning sandbars into islands and equipping them with airfields, ports and weapons systems.  all or parts of the sea are also claimed by brunei, malaysia, the philippines, taiwan and vietnam, which has led to intense territorial disputes and naval standoffs.  the us and other nations have tested beijing's claims by conducting ""freedom of navigation"" operations around islands controlled by china.  last month, the guided-missile destroyer uss stethem came within 12 miles of triton island in the paracel archipelago, which is claimed by china, vietnam and taiwan.   territorial disputes in their statement monday, the three foreign ministers said they would ""continue to fly, sail, and operate wherever international law allows. ""  they urged all claimants in the region to ""refrain from land reclamation, construction of outposts, militarization of disputed features, and undertaking unilateral actions that cause permanent physical change to the marine environment in areas pending delimitation. ""  while china is the most active in terms of building up the territories it controls, both the philippines and vietnam have begun to follow beijing's lead.   the philippines scored a major legal victory last year, when an international tribunal in the hague threw out most of china's territorial claims, but since the election of president rodrigo duterte, manila has become less confrontational with beijing.   monday's joint statement described the ruling as ""legally binding on both parties"" and urged the philippines and china to abide by it.   code of conduct the ministers also called for a proposed code of conduct in the south china sea, to be negotiated by china and the association of southeast asian nations (asean), to be ""legally binding, meaningful, effective, and consistent with international law. ""  attempts to hammer out such guidelines have been ongoing for years, and asean members and beijing announced sunday that they had agreed a framework for a future code of conduct, but formal negotiations are not expected to start until november, according to cnn philippines.  chinese foreign minister wang yi would not comment on whether beijing supported the code being legally binding.   the framework is largely based on a 2002 declaration by asean members and china, and analyst greg poling of the asia maritime transparency institute told cnn last week that some asean nations remain suspicious of china's motives, seeing the slow pace of progress as ""another delaying tactic by beijing. ""  ""asean set aside the tribunal ruling, didn't complain about continued chinese militarization of the south china sea, watered down its joint statements, and basically wasted a year, all so they could reiterate the same principles they already agreed to in the declaration on conduct 15 years ago,"" poling said prior to sunday's announcement.

2020-11-22,The much-hyped Hong Kong-Singapore 'travel bubble' is postponed amid Covid-19 spike,"the highly-anticipated hong kong and singapore ""air travel bubble"" was postponed saturday -- less than 24 hours before it was due to launch.  the bubble would have allowed quarantine-free, air travel between the two asian hubs.  but a spike in coronavirus infections in hong kong means the arrangement will be postponed for two weeks, said edward yau, hong kong's secretary for commerce and economic development, at a press conference saturday.   hong kong reported 43 new coronavirus cases on saturday, the highest daily spike in over three months.  among them, 36 were locally transmitted -- including 13 that are untraceable.  the quarantine-free corridor was meant to boost tourism and business travel between the two asian hubs, which have largely contained their coronavirus outbreak.  hong kong has recorded 5,561 covid-19 cases, including 108 deaths, since the outbreak began, while singapore has reported 58,000 infections and 28 deaths.  quarantine-free travel would have been a big deal for both destinations, where strict arrival regulations have been in place for months.  when the coronavirus pandemic hit, both governments shut borders and denied entry to most non-residents and short-term visitors.  in hong kong, returning residents are required to undergo a 14-day quarantine and wear an electronic bracelet to track their location.  how the bubble was meant to work the bubble was set to begin sunday with one flight a day into each city, with a quota of 200 travelers per flight -- and later set increased to two flights a day.    travelers would have to meet certain parameters before embarking, such as having made no trips in the previous 14 days, and undergo compulsory covid-19 testing.  but they wouldn't be subject to any quarantine or stay-home notice requirements, or a controlled itinerary, upon arrival.  however, the arrangement always included the caveat that should the covid-19 situation deteriorate in either city, the plan would be suspended.  singapore's civil aviation authority initially announced on saturday morning that the travel bubble with hong kong would be launched as scheduled.  but later that day, the city-state's transport minister ong ye kung announced there had been a change of plan.  ""given the evolving situation in hong kong, secretary edward yau and i discussed further this afternoon, and decided that it would be better to defer the launch of the atb, by two weeks.  we will review within two weeks on the new launch date and update again,"" ong said.  hong kong has seen a sharp rise in coronavirus infections in the past few days, after weeks of steadily low number of cases.  the city's centre for health protection ""strongly urged"" the public to avoid all non-essential travel outside hong kong, and called on residents to avoid going out, dining out and having social contact.  ""the scale of the increase is very alarming,"" chuang shuk-kwan, head of the communicable disease branch at hong kong's centre for health protection said on saturday.   she warned that this new increase in cases will be ""very difficult to control.

""i had treated a patient with severe condition, and the result has been very satisfactory.  the patient's condition has improved very quickly within 48 hours.  and the test result has also changed from being positive into negative within 48 hours as well,"" atipornwanich said.   officials at the press conference said the latest lab test has showed there's no trace of the virus in the patient's respiratory system.  dr.  anthony fauci, director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases at the us national institutes of health, told cnn last week there are currently no proven effective drugs to treat the virus.   hospitals in beijing have reported using the same drugs given to hiv and aids patients are part of treatment for the wuhan coronavirus, though it is unclear if they have been successful.  correction: this post has been updated to accurately reflect the number of patients successfully treated the hubei health authority reported that 56 people died of the coronavirus on sunday, raising the death toll since the beginning of the outbreak to 361.   authorities confirmed an additional 2,103 cases of the virus in hubei, according to the health authority, which brings the total number of cases to over 16,600.  the health authority said 9,618 patients have been hospitalized, including 478 who are in critical condition.   russia is suspending all international rail services between russia and china, including those operated by chinese rail companies, russian railways said sunday.  unused tickets for cancelled trains booked and issued at russian points of sale can be returned without incurring any charges or fees, the company's statement said.  there are now nine cases of the novel coronavirus in the united states.  there are four confirmed cases in california; one case each in massachusetts, washington state and arizona and two in illinois.  the second case in illinois is the only instance so far of person-to-person transmission in the united states, state health officials said.   confirmed cases by state: nine confirmed cases as of sunday, february 2.   arizona – 1 california – 4 illinois – 2 massachusetts – 1 washington state – 1 the us department of homeland security added four airports – dallas, detroit, newark and dulles – to the list of airports where us citizens who have traveled to china in the last 14 days can enter the us, according to a statement from the agency.  the four new airports add to the seven gateway airports that were initially listed: jfk, lax, seattle, san francisco, chicago, atlanta and honolulu.  the restrictions began at 5 p. m.  et sunday night.  dhs says those airports have an increased ability to conduct enhanced screening procedures.  citizens who have been in hubei province in the last 14 days of their return will face 14 days of mandatory quarantine.  those who have been to other parts of china will have 14 days of self-quarantine.   foreign nationals will be largely denied entry to the us unless they are the immediate family members of us citizens, permanent residents or flight crew.  santa clara county, california, confirmed the second case of the novel coronavirus, the santa clara county public health department said sunday.  this second case of the virus is in an adult female, the public health department said in a statement.  the newest case is unrelated to the first case but both individuals recently traveled to wuhan, china, the department said.  the newest patient arrived january 23 to visit family in santa clara county, public health officials said.  ""she has stayed home since she arrived, except for two times to seek outpatient medical care.  she has been regularly monitored and was never sick enough to be hospitalized,"" the statement said.  there have been four cases of the coronavirus in california.  the department of homeland security (dhs) announced it will begin enforcing restrictions for all passenger flights carrying individuals who have recently traveled from china in response to the coronavirus, according to a dhs press release that shed light on some of the procedures us air travelers can expect in the coming days the screening parameters reiterate much of what the health and human services secretary previously announced go into effect at 5 p. m.  et today – including that flights will be routed to seven designated us airports where the centers for disease control and prevention will seek to identify all potentially ill persons.   dhs adds that americans flying to the us from china will be re-routed to the designated airports at no cost to the traveler, the dhs said.  according to acting dhs secretary chad f.  wolf, to minimize disruptions, customs and border protection and air carriers are working to identify qualifying passengers before their scheduled flights.  dhs advises if a traveler who spent time in china, outside the hubei province, is re-routed through one of the seven airports and shows no symptoms following a health screening, they will be re-booked to their destination and asked to ""self-quarantine"" at their homes.  the department adds that any individual traveling from china who has either been in hubei province or other areas of the mainland, and is showing virus symptoms, will be screened and subject to mandatory quarantine by medical professionals at a nearby facility.  while the ""overall risk to the american public remains low,"" acting secretary chad f.  wolf says ""funneling all flights with passengers who have recently been in china is the most important and prudent step we can take at this time to decrease the strain on public health officials screening incoming travelers. "" national security adviser robert o'brien said that right ""now there is no reason for americans to panic"" with regards to the coronavirus, adding that ""this is something that is a low risk we think in the us,"" according to an interview he did today with cbs' ""face the nation. "" o'brien says that the us is working with chinese authorities, its health authorities and the world health organization to determine where the virus came from.  the us continues to offer the chinese assistance but have not heard back on that.  o'brien claims the chinese have been more transparent than in past crises.   ""this is a worldwide concern we want to help our chinese colleague if we can,"" o'brien said.  ""look i think we can be helpful if we're on the ground, right now the chinese are providing information to us and we're taking that for what it's worth but at the same time we're monitoring ourselves and what we're especially doing is monitoring the situation here in the states to make sure americans are continuing to be safe from this virus. "" pakistani students studying at wuhan university are appealing to the pakistan government to be evacuated from the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak.   ""we have been getting reports that the spread of this virus is going to double up in the coming 10 days and that the current weather is going to be favorable for a further spread of the virus.  there is a panicked situation and we are appealing to the pakistani government, please take us to a safe location.  anywhere in china, we have very little children with us.  they are compromised, they are more susceptible to the disease.  we are only getting verbal help from the embassy, no physical help.  i'd just like to add that we are willing to pay for our own expenses to get out of here but please for god's sake get us out of here.  please,"" mohammad adnan shireen told cnn.  last week the pakistani government stated they would not be evacuating any students in wuhan.   the second evacuation flight that will carry us citizens out of the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak is on its way to the city of wuhan, a us official with knowledge of the matter told cnn.   the flight should be ready for departure on monday, as indicated in us embassy beijing's email to american citizens who are still in the central chinese city, according to this official.  there may be additional evacuation flights due to continued high-demand from us citizens in wuhan, the official added.   ""i can't confirm the numbers yet, but this upcoming evacuation might not be the last,"" he said.  some context: last wednesday a chartered plane carrying some 200 us citizens -- including about three dozen diplomats and their families -- arrived at march air reserve base in southern california.  the official with knowledge to the matter told cnn all us diplomats and their families in wuhan were able to leave on this first flight.  israel has temporarily banned land, sea and airport arrivals from china to prevent the spread of coronavirus, according to the prime minister's office on twitter.   prime minister benjamin netanyahu on sunday warned that the arrival of the virus in israel could only be delayed, not prevented entirely.   ""our objective first of all is to delay the virus from entering the country.  i say to 'delay' because it is impossible to prevent it from getting here afterwards to treat it, to find the people who have been exposed, to isolate them, and then to treat them,"" netanyahu told a meeting, including government ministers and leading health experts.  although there have been a number of people checked with coronavirus symptoms in israel, all of those tested for the virus so far have come back negative.  ""because we expect that the virus will arrive here, we will deal with the processes that should be put in place to isolate the exposed and to treat them.  this treatment includes two weeks of isolation at home, we will explain to the citizens of israel exactly what is demanded of them,"" netanyahu said.  he also said that israel had updated the palestinian authority about the measures it should take to treat the virus.  netanyahu instructed israel's institute for biological research to begin working ""at the greatest possible speed"" to produce a vaccine and set up a vaccine center in israel.  he added that israel would began an information campaign to let israeli citizens know what to look for and what to do in case symptoms of the coronavirus are observed.  china's xiangyang city announced the shutdown of its railway stations and suspension of public transportation at the end of january.  with xiangyang's lockdown, all major cities in hubei province are now under lockdown, affecting more than 62 million people.   as of feb 1, there are 441 confirmed cases of coronavirus in xiangyang city, according to hubei provincial health commission.  hong kong has confirmed another coronavirus case, bringing the total cases in the city to 15.  the 15th case is reported to be a 72-year-old woman who is the mother of another person confirmed to have the infection in hong kong, according to a statement sunday from hong kong's health department.  the woman is under quarantine and in stable condition, the health department said.   ""according to the patient's information, she had no travel history and mainly stayed at home during the incubation period,"" according to the health department's statement.   german health minister jens spahn announced two more people have tested positive for coronavirus in germany, taking the total in the country to 10.  the pair are both in frankfurt, in the german state of hesse, and are doing well, spahn said, noting they will be kept in a clinic for two weeks until they are free of infection.  the two confirmed cases arrived in frankfurt on a german air force flight flight from wuhan, china, on saturday.  germany's foreign ministry said friday that around 100 german citizens would be repatriated and be put under quarantine for two weeks in order to prevent the spread of the disease.   the minister said that they are monitoring if there were any other infections during the incubation period but he hopes that is not the case.   the previous eight confirmed cases are all in bavaria state.   the minister noted that the government aims to be as transparent as possible and he is very thankful for his colleagues in bavaria and hesse.  when it comes to questions about the infection, they [the government] will answer as transparently as possible.  the formula e championship has called off next month's sanya e-prix race in china due to the coronavirus outbreak, formula e said in a statement on sunday.   the race was scheduled for march 21.  the statement said: ""given the current growing health concerns and with the world health organisation declaring the coronavirus an international emergency, formula e has taken the necessary measures to ensure the health and safety of its travelling staff, championship participants and spectators, which remains of paramount importance,"" the statement said.  as news of the virus has spread, many people of asian descent living abroad say they have been treated like walking pathogens.  a malaysian-chinese social worker experienced the same thing on a london bus this week.  ""a couple of people at an east london school i work in have asked me why chinese people eat weird food when they know it causes viruses,"" she told cnn.  in canada, there have been reports of chinese children being bullied or singled out at school.  in new zealand -- where there are no confirmed coronavirus cases -- a singaporean woman says she was confronted and faced racist harassment in a mall.  read the full story here.  a second french plane carrying european citizens from wuhan will land in istres, france, on sunday, the belgian foreign ministry said in a statement.  some passengers will disembark at istres and be placed in quarantine before the plane continues on to melsbroek air base, in belgium.   belgian passengers will be taken care of in belgium, and dutch, danish, czech and slovak citizens will be repatriated to their own countries, the ministry said, calling it a ""prime example of european cooperation. "" the plane was chartered by france, and is part of the european crisis management mechanism.  five czechs and two slovaks are on board the plane, according to the czech ministry of foreign affairs.  they will be flown from belgium to the czech capital of prague on a government plane.   british citizens are also thought to be on this flight.  uk foreign secretary dominic raab said sunday that 11 britons who failed to leave wuhan last week are now on a french flight returning to the uk sunday.  all eight people diagnosed with coronavirus in bavaria, germany, are in a stable condition, the bavarian health ministry said in a statement sunday.  germany has confirmed its eighth case of coronavirus on saturday.  the patient, a 33 year-old man from munich, works at the same company as six of the previously known coronavirus cases in germany.  the eight person with the virus in germany is a child of one of the people diagnosed earlier, the ministry said.   the detection was possibly due to a test campaign for all employees at the the firm, the statement said.   the great firewall of china has always been annoying, but it's not usually this deadly.  as the wuhan coronavirus continues to spread around china and the world, many are questioning how much the country's colossal censorship apparatus played a role in withholding vital information about the epidemic until it was too late.  in the weeks after the virus was first detected in wuhan, local and national authorities followed the usual playbook for any potential controversy: knee-jerk censorship and tight control of the narrative.  as the crisis has worsened, however -- with thousands of confirmed cases and hundreds of deaths nationwide -- it has become clear that the failure to take quick action likely undermined any chance of containing the virus.  heads will likely roll in wuhan, where the city's mayor zhou xianwang has already publicly offered to resign, admitting that his administration's warnings were ""not sufficient. "" a number of uk citizens who failed to leave the coronavirus-struck chinese city of wuhan last week are now on a second flight to europe, uk foreign secretary dominic raab said sunday.  speaking to sky news, raab said he could not confirm the ""precise number"" of those arriving into the uk on sunday.  a number of uk citizens had trouble reaching the muster point in time for the first flight out because of road blocks and other restrictions in place in wuhan.  britons being brought from wuhan to the uk are being placed in quarantine at arrowe park hospital in the wirral, northwest england, raab said.   the first flight on friday returned 83 uk nationals.   a new case of coronavirus has been reported in the united arab emirates, the country's fifth, the ministry of health and prevention announced on saturday.  the patient, who arrived from wuhan, is ""stable and under medical care,"" the ministry said in a statement, adding there is ""no cause for concern"" for the public.  the national airlines of egypt, qatar and saudi arabia have halted flights to and from china.  the wuhan coronavirus has brought back memories of the 2003 outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome, known as sars, which infected more than 8,000 people and killed 774.  like sars, this latest outbreak is caused by a coronavirus, a family of viruses common to animals that range from the common cold, to more serious diseases, like middle east respiratory syndrome (mers).  here is how the two compare: the south korean government is banning entry to all foreign nationals who visited china's hubei province in the past 14 days.  the measure starts on february 4, according to south korean prime minister chung sye-kyun.  chung also said south korean citizens who had visited the province in the past 14 days should voluntarily quarantine themselves at home for two weeks after they arrive back into the country.  a system that allows chinese citizens to enter south korea's jeju island without a visa is to be temporarily suspended.  singapore, australia, new zealand, and the united states have banned all foreign nationals traveling from china from entering the country.     the first case of coronavirus was detected in central china in early december.  now, nearly two months later, it's a full-blown global emergency, with more than 14,300 confirmed cases across the world.  here's a look back at how we got here: december 8: first patient develops symptoms of wuhan coronavirus
december 31: earliest cases of virus reported to world health organization (who)
january 1: seafood and wildlife market in wuhan, where the outbreak is believed to have originated, is closed for disinfection

january 28: death toll tops 100.  the number of confirmed cases in mainland china overtakes the deadly 2003 sars outbreak
january 30: who declares a public health emergency of international concern
january 31: death toll tops 200
february 2: first wuhan coronavirus death reported outside of mainland china  correction: a previous version of this post contained a map that misattributed the source of provincial coronavirus case totals.  the data comes from each province's health authority, not china's national health commission.   france is helping evacuate 10 mexican citizens from wuhan, the capital of hubei province and the city where the coronavirus outbreak started.   the 10 mexican nationals are first flying to france after being examined to confirm they don't have symptoms, mexico's foreign ministry and health ministry said in a joint statement saturday.  in france ""they will follow the health protocols established by the authorities of that country. "" after that, the group will return to mexico, the ministries said.   a number of countries have evacuated their citizens from wuhan, including australia, germany and france.   wuhan authorities have finished building a new 1,000-bed hospital to treat coronavirus patients, state media cctv reported sunday.  wuhan mayor zhou xianwang handed the new huoshenshan hospital over to the military on sunday morning.  according to cctv, 1,400 military medical personnel will start in the hospital from monday.   state media first reported on january 23 that authorities planned to build a new pneumonia hospital.  according to the beijing news, a state-backed newspaper, it is a prefabricated, box-type model that can be built in six days.   another medical facility -- the leishenshen hospital -- is under construction and is set to open on february 5.  together, the two hospitals will give an additional 2,600 beds for patient care during the outbreak.  it's not the first time china has built a hospital in a short period of time.  during the 2003 sars outbreak, the 1,000-bed xiaotangshan hospital was constructed in six days and seven nights in beijing.  if you've traveled in or transited through mainland china, you won't be allowed into new zealand unless you're a new zealand national.  the new restrictions on foreign nationals begin on february 3, prime minister jacinda ardern announced in a press release sunday.  the ban will be in place for up to 14 days, and is aimed at helping contain the spread of the wuhan coronavirus.  so far, there have been no confirmed coronavirus cases in new zealand or any south pacific island.   new zealand citizens and permanent residents and their immediate family members will still be able to enter -- but must self-isolate for 14 days after arriving back into the country.  what does the new zealand government say about traveling to china? the ministry of foreign affairs and trade has raised its travel advice for mainland china to ""do not travel,"" the highest level.  ""(cabinet) have been advised by health officials that while there are still a range of unknowns in the way the virus is being transmitted, we should take a precautionary approach and temporarily stop travel into new zealand from mainland china, and of people who have recently been in china,"" ardern said.  other countries have also banned people traveling from china  on saturday, australia said it was denying entry to all travelers coming from, or who had transited through, mainland china.  australian citizens, permanent residents and their immediate families, and air crews who used appropriate protective equipment, are exempt. 
on friday, the united states said it will deny entry to foreign nationals who have traveled in china in the last 14 days.  chinese premier li keqiang has called on manufacturers to ramp up production of medical equipment needed to control the coronavirus outbreak.  li -- who is the second-most powerful man in china -- said it was important to ""make every minute count,"" according to a government press release sunday.  ""manufacturers are like military contractors producing the 'arsenal' in this battle against the epidemic,"" li said.  li warned that getting daily necessities could become more challenging, and stressed the need to keep supply chains open to ensure groceries are available for the public.  previously, li asked the european union to help china procure medical supplies, according to a chinese government statement.  what's the background? china is facing a public health care crisis.  patients, medical staff and experts have told of delays in testing for the virus, in informing the public the true nature of the virus' spread, and of an already overburdened health system creaking under the enormous weight of a rapidly expanding outbreak.  people in wuhan have told cnn that some hospitals have run out of the test kits needed to diagnose patients with coronavirus.   wuhan health authorities have acknowledged that hospitals are overwhelmed, and the city is building two more hospitals within days.  airlines operating in the united states will be required to ask all passengers booked on flights from outside the us if they've been to mainland china in last 14 days.   the transport security administration (tsa) will issue a new security directive to airlines from sunday, according to a person briefed on the restrictions.  chinese nationals coming from china and connecting through another foreign airport will be denied travel.  those with pre-clearance are exempted.   there are also new directives that relate to us citizens.  us citizens who have been to china in the last 14 days need to re-book to one of seven gateway airports: john f.  kennedy international airport in new york, los angeles international airport, seattle, san francisco international airport, chicago, atlanta and honolulu.  tsa notified airlines saturday about the restrictions.  cnn is reaching out to tsa for comment.  the wuhan coronavirus has spread throughout the world since the first cases were detected in central china in december.   the vast majority of the cases are  in mainland china, where more than 14,000 people have been infected and 305 people have died.  but there are also more than 160 confirmed cases abroad.   one person has died outside of mainland china -- a 44-year-old chinese man in the philippines.  here's the full list of places outside mainland china with confirmed cases: hong kong -- at least 13 cases
macau -- at least 7 cases

sweden -- at least 1 case
spain -- at least 1 case british airways, qantas and lufthansa -- among others -- have announced they will stop flying to mainland china.  other airlines are reducing the number of flights.  there's a few factors that play into this.  travel alerts: as the wuhan coronavirus spreads around china, infecting more people, a number of countries have raised their travel advisory warnings.  the united kingdom, for instance, is now warning against all but essential travel to mainland china, and is advising against all travel to hubei province, where the outbreak was first reported.  looking after their staff: airlines are under pressure from their staff, who obviously want to protect themselves.  on friday, the us association of flight attendants -- which represents 50,000 flight attendants across 20 airlines -- called on the government to work with airlines to discontinue all travel to china until the spread of coronavirus is contained.  slow business: due to fear -- and travel warnings -- fewer people want to travel to china.  that impacts airlines' business, making it less financially attractive for them to fly those routes to china.  as united airlines said when suspended flights to beijing, shanghai and chengdu, the decision was made ""due to the continued drop in demand for travel to china and the us department of state's decision to raise its china travel advisory to a level 4. ""  read more about what's going on here.   the philippines reported its first wuhan coronavirus fatality on sunday.  the victim -- who died saturday -- was a 44-year-chinese man who flew in from wuhan in january.  it's the first confirmed wuhan coronavirus death from outside of mainland china, and brings the total toll to 305.   he was the partner of a 38-year-old chinese woman who was travelling with him.  she was the first confirmed case reported in the philippines.  both patients were being treated in isolation units at a manila hospital.  secretary of health francisco duque said authorities are working with the chinese embassy to respectfully handle the remains of the man while following international protocol to contain the disease.  defense secretary mark esper has approved a request to provide military housing for up to 1,000 people who may need to be quarantined after arriving in the us from overseas travel, the pentagon said in a statement.  the department of health and human services asked the defense department to provide several facilities capable of housing at least 250 people in individual rooms through to february 29, the pentagon said.  what's the background? on friday, the trump administration announced it will deny entry to foreign nationals who have traveled in china in the last 14 days, starting sunday.  any us citizen who has been in china's hubei province -- epicenter of the outbreak -- in the last 14 days will be allowed back into the country.  but they'll be subject to up to 14 days of mandatory quarantine once they're back in the us.  us citizens who've been in other parts of mainland china in the last 14 days will undergo screening at us ports of entry and up to 14 days of self-monitoring.  american airlines and delta air lines announced more flight cancellations to china on saturday as coronavirus cases continued to rise.  delta said it will suspend flights between the united states and china starting on sunday until at least april 30, according to a press release.   that's four days earlier than it had initially planned.  delta's last china-bound flight left on saturday, february 1, and its final returning flight from china to the united states leaves on sunday.   delta moved the date up after the us state department warned that people should not travel to china due to concerns about the spread of coronavirus, which was first discovered in wuhan, hubei province, in december.   united airlines -- which announced that it will suspend flights to beijing, chengdu and shanghai from february 6 -- is also reducing flights from the us to hong kong.   yet it's not only us carriers that are cancelling flights.  here's a list of other airlines that have reduced -- or completely cut -- flights to china: british airways

cathay pacific
air india

lufthansa
finnair 
qantas
qatar airways three more patients have been confirmed infected with coronavirus in south korea, bringing the country's total to 15, the south korean centers for disease control and prevention (kcdc) announced in a press release.  the kcdc said a 28-year-old man had tested positive.  he was among the 368 repatriated south koreans who arrived from wuhan on a charter flight on january 31.  the rest of the evacuees have tested negative for the coronavirus.  a 40-year-old chinese woman also tested positive.  she was already in quarantine as she is related to another patient who contracted the virus.  in china, wuhan used to be known as a city of cherry blossoms, an economic engine of the central heartland, and the birthplace of a century-old revolution that brought down the country's last imperial dynasty.  but now, the metropolis of 11 million in hubei province has become the face of a deadly coronavirus outbreak -- a stigma the people of wuhan increasingly find themselves unable to shake off.  with the death toll surging past 300 and 14,300 cases confirmed, authorities across the country have activated the highest public health emergency response, stepping up screening of arrivals from wuhan.  fears over the continuing spread of coronavirus have also fueled resentment and discrimination.  some have become outcasts in their own country, shunned by hotels, neighbors and -- in some areas -- placed under controversial quarantine measures.  wuhan officials estimate about 5 million people had left the city for the annual lunar new year holiday before authorities canceled all outbound flights, trains and buses in an unprecedented lockdown on january 23.  april pin, a wuhan resident, wrote a widely circulated open letter pleading her countrymen to forgive those who left without knowing: ""many of my friends who left wuhan did not realize (how severe) the situation was,"" she wrote read more about pin -- and the plight of people from wuhan -- here.   australia has started denying entry to all travelers who have come from or transited through mainland china.  the new rules started saturday -- however if you're an australian citizen, permanent resident or their immediate family, or an aircrew member who has been using appropriate protective equipment, you're exempt.  prime minister scott morrison said saturday that all travelers from mainland china allowed into australia had to be quarantined for 14 days.  he added that the government raised the travel advice warning to level four, the highest, meaning they're now advising people not to travel to mainland china.  the warning aims to address ""the issue of the human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus. "" australia's ban followed an earlier move by the us friday to deny entry to foreign nationals who have traveled in china in the last 14 days.  any us citizen who has been in the hubei province in the last 14 days will be subject to up to 14 days of mandatory quarantine upon return to the united states.   villages and cities in china have resorted to flying drones with speakers to patrol streets and scold people not wearing masks in public amid the coronavirus outbreak, according to chinese state media.   both xinhua and the global times have published videos of drones warning various people in rural areas that masks need to be worn in ""these times. "" the drones were seen scolding an elderly lady and chasing a child down the road.   the videos have gone viral on chinese social media and have been praised as a novel way to raise awareness of the disease.   global times reported that local officials had been putting up slogans in an effort to get communities to stay at home during the epidemic and to avoid people gathering together to slow and prevent the spread of the coronavirus.  a total of 304 people had died from coronavirus in mainland china by the end of saturday, according to the country's national health commission.  so far, there have been no deaths outside the mainland.  the vast majority of the deaths have occurred in the province of hubei, of which wuhan is the capital.  wuhan -- home to 11 million people -- is the epicenter of the outbreak.  the total number of confirmed cases in mainland china is now 14,380 -- an increase of 2,590 from friday's total.  apple is temporarily closing all of its stores in china because of the coronavirus outbreak.   according to apple's website, all 42 stores will be closed until february 9.  the website still works for customers in china.  here's what apple told cnn business in a statement: ""out of an abundance of caution and based on the latest advice from leading health experts, we're closing all our corporate offices, stores and contact centers in mainland china through february 9. "" 
 ""we will continue to closely monitor the situation and we look forward to reopening our stores as soon as possible. "" read more here.   over the past few days, there's been a question dominating chinese social media: could a traditional chinese medicine help fight the wuhan coronavirus? the questions came after state-run xinhua news agency reported friday that the shanghai institute of materia medica and the wuhan institute of virology had discovered that the shuanghuanglian oral liquid -- a popular combined herbal remedy commonly used to relieve some symptoms such as fever, cough, and sore throat -- could be used to ""inhibit"" the deadly virus.  but others aren't convinced -- they think one of the country's most influential state media outlets could be promoting pseudoscience and false hope.  social media users -- including numerous medical experts -- questioned whether the findings were supported by clinical evidence from treating coronavirus patients.  others -- somewhat more cynically -- wondered if this was a concerted effort to promote certain herbal products to boost their makers' share prices ahead of the chinese stock market's re-opening monday.  nevertheless, many other didn't appear to need confirmation.  posts on weibo, china's twitter-like platform, purportedly showed people lining up at night outside pharmacies across china to buy shuanghuanglian.  such was the apparent demand sparked by the notice that the compound formula sold out on some stores on china's e-commerce platform taobao.  read more here.  there's still a lot we don't know about the coronavirus, and scientists internationally are racing to gather data and develop a treatment.  here's what we can tell you so far: is there a cure? not at the moment.  researchers have successfully grown the virus in a lab, an important step towards developing a vaccine -- but it could be a year or more until it's available. 
what are the symptoms? coronavirus symptoms can look like the flu -- fever, cough, trouble breathing.  if you show these symptoms and recently went to china, or have been in contact with someone who visited, experts advise going to the doctor. 
how does the virus spread? the virus is thought to spread from person to person through respiratory droplets emitted by coughing or sneezing -- but it's not clear exactly when a person becomes contagious.  there's currently no evidence that the virus is airborne -- meaning, for instance, it doesn't travel across a large room. 
who is at risk of infection? people of all ages can be infected with the virus, but older people and those with pre-existing medical conditions are especially vulnerable to severe complications. 
how can i protect myself? take the same precautionary measures you would during flu season.  wash your hands often with soap and water, cover your nose and mouth when you sneeze or cough, avoid close contact with people or large gatherings, and wear a face mask. 
is it safe to travel? airlines have suspended flights, and thousands of foreign citizens in the chinese city of wuhan have been evacuated back to their home countries.  many countries including the us have advised against travel to china.
