2020-12-29,Trump administration appeals court order blocking TikTok restrictions,"the trump administration isn't giving up on its campaign against tiktok just yet.   the us government on monday appealed a decision handed down by a federal judge earlier this month that prevented authorities from fully implementing its restrictions against the popular short-form video app.   the appeal challenges a dec.  7 preliminary injunction from us district court judge carl nichols, which prevented the us department of commerce from enforcing rules that would have made it illegal for infrastructure companies to carry tiktok's network traffic.   that ruling followed an earlier injunction that prevented the commerce department from banning downloads of tiktok from us app stores.   tiktok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  the company has been in the trump administration's cross hairs for months.  us president donald trump has accused tiktok of posing a national security risk because its chinese owner, bytedance, could be forced to hand over tiktok's user data to the chinese government.  tiktok has denied the claim and said tiktok stores us user data in virginia and singapore — out of the reach of chinese law.  tiktok has been hammering out a deal with the us government meant to satisfy its concerns that would bring in us investors, such as oracle and walmart.  but that deal has not been finalized.   earlier this month, the us government declined to extend a deadline it had set for bytedance to sell off the app.  but it also decided not to enforce an executive order requiring the sale.  that allowed negotiations between tiktok and us officials to continue.  but it's not clear whether concerns about the app will be resolved before president-elect joe biden takes office next month.

2019-06-08,Taiwan used to be home to a huge number of bears. No one really knows how many are left,"in the foothills leading to dasyueshan national park in eastern taiwan, mei-hsiu hwang points to the pear, tea and betel nut plantations patchworking the slopes.  ""all this used to be bear habitat,"" she says.  in particular, the formosan black bear, a large omnivore native to the high, clouded mountains that run down the spine of taiwan.  hwang, associate professor and director of the institute of wildlife conservation at taiwan's national pingtung university of science and technology, is likely the world's foremost expert on this species.   but when she first started to study the huge mammals as part of her phd in 1996, she says her friends and acquaintances reacted with shock.  ""they'd say, 'do we have bears in taiwan? we never had bears.  do we still have bears?'"" she recalls.  more than two decades later, the black bear is rapidly becoming a symbol for taiwan.  the mascot of taipei city is a black bear named ""bravo,"" who was present at celebrations on may 24, when taiwan held asia's first same-sex weddings.   meanwhile, the island's now-defunct v air airline took its name from the distinctive white v shape on the black bear's chest.   but despite an increased profile, these animals are still in deep trouble, says hwang.  classified as ""endangered"" by the taiwan government, the species is being pushed to the brink of extinction by illegal hunting and land clearing.  worse still, the relative rarity of these bears, combined with their dislike of humans, makes it almost impossible to know how many are left.  hwang estimates there are between just 200 and 600 black bears over the entire island.  ""if we cannot protect them, i don't believe we can protect anything else,"" says hwang.   ""bears are a flagship species, they're big, like a star, like pandas, elephants and tigers.  if a country cannot protect them, will you be able to protect other, smaller wildlife? i don't think so. "" forced into the mountains hwang has to travel hours up into the hills, far from taiwan's towns and cities, to access the areas still inhabited by bears.  there are no official statistics from 100 years ago, before taiwan's human population rapidly expanded, but hwang says there are a large number of indigenous taiwanese traditions relating to the bears that go back centuries.  even during japanese occupation of the island in the early 20th century there were reports of bears being found as low as 100 meters above sea level.  now, hwang says, they almost entirely live above 1,000 meters.   ""at lower elevations, theoretically it would be good habitat, but (they're driven higher) because of all the human disturbances -- mining, recreation, a lot of people activity,"" she says.   the bears are primarily omnivorous, with their diet consisting mainly of fruits, nuts and berries.  they scrounge over a massive habitat measuring hundreds of square kilometers.  unlike other large bears, they don't hibernate.  the formosan black bear is a subspecies of the asian black bear, which can be found across east and southeast asia, including in japan, thailand and south korea.  the entire species is marked as ""vulnerable"" by the international union for conservation of nature, but hwang says it hasn't attracted as much attention as other more eye-catching animals, such as pandas or asian elephants.  in fact, the lack of interest to protect the bears that she faced when she started working with them made her furious.  ""it is a shame for taiwanese people,"" says hwang.  ""i feel ashamed, how come they're endangered and they're still treated this way. "" hunted for meat and medicine while habitat loss has been hard on the bears, the biggest threat to taiwan's largest mammal is illegal hunting.  over recent decades, there's been a growing, lucrative trade in bear parts -- bear meat for the black market and bones, gallbladders and paws for traditional chinese medicine.  in the past there were strict taboos among indigenous taiwanese about hunting bears.  if you killed one, hwang says, some tribes even isolated you out of fear you would bring bad luck back to the village.  but now, a black bear corpse can be worth as much as $5,000 to a hunter.  studies around yushan national park prior to the 1980s found 22% of the area's bears were killed for their meat and body parts.  by the 1990s, this had soared to 59%.  hwang says the solution lies in education.  if the market for bear parts and meat can be ended by raising consumer awareness, the animals can be saved.  ""if there is no market demand, i believe this will lead to less bear killing.  this surely will help,"" she says.  another problem is that, due to bears' large feeding grounds, they regularly stray outside of the protected forests and into the wilds where they are vulnerable.  displaying the gps data of one adult male on her laptop, hwang shows us his path over the course of months.    ""that's the protected forest,"" she says, pointing to a small square covering just a fraction of his path.  still, hwang says there doesn't need to be more protected areas across the island, just better enforcement against illegal hunting.  ""if all the suitable habitat allowed bears to survive, the current capacity for the whole island is able to have 5,000 to 10,000 individuals,"" she says.  instead, there are just hundreds.  'more precious than pandas' the only place anyone is likely to see a black bear these days is behind wire and glass at the taipei zoo.  on a sunny saturday, tourists from the island and mainland china cluster around the window of the formosan black bear enclosure.   ""he's coming.  he's so cute,"" one tourist says in mandarin as the huge shaggy bear ambles through its cage.  tsai chien-chuan, 40-year-old father of two, brought his daughters to the enclosure.  he says people need to be educated about how important the bears are to taiwan.  ""they are more precious than pandas,"" says tsai.  ""they are very important with a smaller population.  if we don't protect them, they may go extinct. "" hwang is hopeful for the future of the bears and says she's been encouraged by the growing island-wide awareness of the animal's plight.  she now has about 25 volunteers working with her group, setting up camera traps high in the mountains to help track the bears' movements.  up in the mountains near dasyueshan, there is first-hand evidence of hope for the bears.   using a gps tracker, linked to a collar, hwang and her team track down a female bear who has been only showing small signs of movement for months.  this is likely because she has just given birth to cubs and has slowed her movements to a minimum to look after the young bears in safety.  ""i do believe we can make a difference,"" says hwang.  ""to be honest i do see a lot of change.

2020-06-08,Pressures increasing on Indonesia and Malaysia in the South China Sea,"chinese and malaysian vessels were locked in a high-stakes standoff for more than one month earlier this year, near the island of borneo in the south china sea.   the malaysian-authorized drill ship, the west capella, was looking for resources in waters also claimed by beijing, when a chinese survey vessel, accompanied by coast guard ships, sailed into the area and began conducting scans, according to satellite images analyzed by the asia maritime transparency institute (amti).  malaysia deployed naval vessels to the area, which were later backed by us warships that had been on joint exercises in the south china sea.  beijing claimed it was conducting ""normal activities in waters under chinese jurisdiction,"" but for years chinese vessels have been accused of hounding countries who try to explore for resources in waters that china claims as its own.  now, experts say the chinese ships are adopting increasingly forceful tactics, which risks sparking new conflicts with major regional powers such as malaysia and indonesia.  greg poling, director of the amti, said the countries are more important than ever as chinese ships expand their reach in the region, mostly due to the advanced construction of beijing's artificial islands in the south china sea.   ""(the islands) provide forward basing for chinese ships, effectively turning malaysia and indonesia into front line states,"" poling said.  ""on any given day, there about dozen coast guard ships buzzing around the spratly islands, and about a hundred fishing boats, ready to go. "" nine-dash line the south china sea is one of the most hotly contested regions in the world, with competing claims from china, vietnam, philippines, malaysia, brunei and taiwan and indonesia.  beijing's territorial claims, known as the nine-dash line -- owing to the markings printed on chinese maps of the region -- are by far the largest and encompass almost the entirety of the sea, from hainan island down to the top of indonesia.  china's claims have no basis under international law and were found to be invalid in a 2016 international court ruling.  despite this, from about 2015 the chinese government began to bolster its territorial ambitions by building artificial islands on reefs and shoals in the south china sea, and then militarizing them with aircraft strips, harbors and radar facilities.  ""these (islands) are bristling with radar and surveillance capabilities, they see everything that goes on in the south china sea,"" poling said.  ""in the past, china didn't know where you were drilling.  now they certainly do. "" experts say beijing has created an armada of coast guard and chinese fishing vessels that can be deployed in the south china sea to harass other claimant's ships or sail in politically sensitive areas.  growing aggression the confrontation over the malaysian drill ship wasn't the first act of aggression by the chinese government in the region in 2020.  the year began with a standoff in the natuna islands on the far southern end of the south china sea, territory claimed by china and indonesia.  vessels from both countries were involved in the standoff, which began when chinese fishing vessels started to operate inside indonesia's exclusive economic zone.  eventually, indonesia deployed f-16 fighters and naval ships to the islands and president joko widodo personally flew to the area, in an unusual show of strength from the country.  in april, a chinese maritime surveillance vessel rammed and sank a vietnamese fishing boat near the disputed paracel islands in the south china sea.  the act prompted vietnam to send a diplomatic note to the united nations restating its sovereignty over its exclusive economic zone in the south china sea.  foreign ministry spokesman geng shuang responded by saying china would take ""all measures necessary"" to safeguard beijing's interests in the region.  ""i want to stress this: attempts by any country to negate in any means china's sovereignty, rights and interests in the south china sea and to reinforce its own illegal claim are bound to be fruitless,"" geng said.  insecurity beijing has a long history of harassing other countries' vessels in the south china sea, mostly from vietnam and the philippines and also occasionally from malaysia and indonesia.  in the past, chinese diplomats have helped soothed aggrieved parties, but experts say the fallout from the coronavirus and the rise of so-called ""wolf warrior"" diplomacy in beijing have removed any circuit breaker in the relationship between china and its regional rivals.  ""what has changed is that they've really taken the glove off of the fist diplomatically.  the statements are brash and unhelpful,"" said poling.  experts said beijing's growing forcefulness in the region is partly driven by the global coronavirus pandemic, which has dealt a heavy blow to china's rapid economic growth and damaged the country's international reputation.  at the meeting of its parliament in may, the chinese government didn't set a target for annual gdp growth for the first time in years, a sign that it is concerned about falling economic performance.   at the same time, tensions are rising with the united states and europe over beijing's role in containing the initial outbreak and whether it gave the world enough time to respond to the pandemic, which has killed more than 380,000 people.  concerned about appearing like its grip on power is slipping, the ruling communist party is doubling down on its rhetoric and on its nationalistic agenda, which includes control of the south china sea, experts said.  beijing is keen to foster a narrative that the us is retreating as a global power to solidify its hold on the region, said ian storey, senior fellow at iseas-yusof ishak institute in singapore.  ""it will want to show southeast asian claimants that american military power is on the decline and its commitment to the region is waning,"" storey said.  ""(it will want to show that) the economic problems that china is facing will not impact its policy on the south china sea. "" so far, malaysia and indonesia have tried to avoid letting south china sea dominate their relationship with china, but with beijing marking its territory in the region, the days of quiet diplomacy might not last forever.   ""at what level of aggression does it become impossible to ignore? . . .  at what point do they add their voice to the criticism that you've been getting for years and years from hanoi and manila?"" amti's poling said.   free-for-all facing an entrenched chinese presence on their doorstep, now might seem like the time for southeast asian nations to band together and face down beijing's presence in the region.  but storey said with regional powers preoccupied with coronavirus as well as their own economic and political crises, any hope of unity in the association of southeast asian nations (asean) was unlikely.  ""no matter how hard china pushes i don't think we're going to see the asean members coalesce and present that strong united front against china,"" he said.  ""i think going forward in the next six months, towards the end of 2020, we can expect china to double down on its assertive behavior in the south china sea. "" malaysia has long worked to balance the benefits of a close relationship with china with running its own independent foreign policy, amti's poling said, which is why previous clashes with chinese vessels in malaysian waters were kept out of the media as much as possible.  indonesia has in the past opened fire on chinese fishing vessels that failed to leave its waters, and president widodo's tough behavior in january showed he will not sit by while beijing moves into the natuna islands.  but experts say china won't be easily deterred.  ""beijing believes it can wear down indonesian opposition; and eventually indonesia, much like malaysia, will realize that it has little choice but to accommodate china's presence,"" foreign policy research institute senior fellow felix chang wrote in january.  still, there is risk too for the chinese government.  the united states is already increasing its freedom of navigation operations in the south china sea, holding half as many in the first five months of 2020 as it did in the whole of last year.  washington is also working to directly support southeast asian nations in the south china sea.  the malaysian navy received its first batch of surveillance drones from the us in may.   and, during the west capella's operations, us navy warships performed what the us navy called ""presence operations"" near the drill ship while it was being monitored by the chinese vessels.  ""the us supports the efforts of our allies and partners in the lawful pursuit of their economic interests,"" vice adm.  bill merz, commander of the us 7th fleet, said in a statement at the time.  speaking in a public lecture in may, james holmes, a professor at the us naval war college and former navy officer, said that as beijing pushes harder in the south china sea, the us may look like the better bet for a steady friend.  ""i think china has actually seriously overplayed its hand by being so bullying and by being so aggressive,"" holmes said.  ""that starts driving together allies that are worried about chinese aggression . . .  the more china pushes the more coalition partners are likely to unite and push back. "" any push back could cost beijing economically.  china has close trade ties with many of its regional neighbors, such as the philippines, malaysia and indonesia, and needs them for parts of its international agenda such as its much trumpeted belt and road initiative -- the country's interlinking web of regional trade deals and infrastructure projects.  ""i think there's already been a lot of unease in the region about how china has used covid-19 to push its claims in the south china sea,"" said storey, from iseas-yusof ishak institute.  ""china won't want to completely destroy its relations with southeast asia by pushing too hard.

2021-03-25,Prelate orders temporary closure of 2 pilgrimage sites in Albay,"to prevent the possible spread of the coronavirus disease (covid-19), legazpi bishop joel baylon has ordered the temporary closure of two pilgrimage sites in albay province. these are the shrine of the divine mercy and the stations of the cross at kawa-kawa hill in the city of ligao's tuburan village. ""i am declaring this temporary closure of these pilgrimage sites in order to prevent the possible spread of the virus,"" cbcp news quoted baylon's circular dated march 19. ""this means that not even the private praying of the station of the cross nor a simple visit to the shrine shall be allowed.  kindly know that we are after the safety of everyone,"" he added. the shrine features life-size sculptures of the 14 stations of the cross and is one of the popular lenten destinations in the province. during holy week, thousands of pilgrims from different provinces visit the site to pray. the bishop asked the faithful to instead pray the station of the cross with their respected families at home or privately. people, he said, may also join the parishes and communities that offer online via crucis. ""we can still observe the lenten discipline of prayer by participating in the actual masses in our parishes, faithful recitation of the holy rosary and offering personal prayers,"" baylon said.

2020-09-19,"As Asia's 'travel bubbles' fail to materialize, travelers face prospect of long winter at home","with the end of the year approaching, travelers holding onto hope they may still get to enjoy a quick winter escape in asia are facing some hard truths right now.       christmas on the beach in phuket? highly unlikely -- unless you're willing to quarantine in a hotel for two weeks first.    lunar new year in bali next february? don't book those flights just yet.         the list of countries in the region that are off limits to most leisure travel remains long and, according to the experts, is likely to remain that way for some time yet.     in early may, optimism was high that once governments were able to contain their covid-19 outbreaks they would begin opening up to other nations that too had a handle on their case numbers.     dubbed ""travel bubbles,"" the concept was first raised by australia and new zealand, then quickly picked up by other nations as a possible way to get international travelers flying again.  this would give tourism-dependent economies a chance to recoup the millions of dollars in losses racked up this year.   for a number of reasons, those bubbles -- also called air corridors -- have yet to materialize in asia.   in what's been referred to as a twisted game of ""whack-a-mole,"" the virus continues to rear its invisible head in fresh waves, leading most governments to shy away from actually moving beyond the discussion phase.       ""travel bubbles are extremely complex to implement, much greater than what people may have thought originally,"" says mario hardy, ceo of the pacific asia travel association (pata).  ""each respective destination needs to have well tested and tried protocols and the understanding that visitors from each country will respect them.  they also need to ensure that they have a robust health care system to handle any potential resurgences of cases as well as good contact tracing capabilities. ""  thailand announces long-stay tourist visa   that's not to say baby steps aren't being taken.  almost daily, new headlines announce the lifting of travel restrictions in the region, as well as the resumption of international flights.   but if you look at the fine print, few of these changes mean much for leisure travelers, but rather apply to business travelers and foreign residents.   ""i think the idea that we're going to go back to borders being thrown open any time soon is just not going to happen,"" says gary bowerman, founder of check-in asia, a tourism-focused research and marketing company.    the pressure to stem the economic loss while balancing the risk of a virus resurgence remains heavy.  in addition to nations being afraid they will import further cases of covid-19 by opening the doors to tourists, bowerman points out that ""it's very difficult to get other countries to agree to let travelers come because they know at some point they're going to be coming back and could reimport the virus. ""  australia, for instance, has some of the strictest rules in the world, banning its citizens from traveling abroad for leisure tourism.  thousands of australians are now stranded overseas due to a cap on international arrivals, with only 4,000 allowed in per week.   bowerman says singapore is leading the way in southeast asia when it comes to the gradual opening of borders.  the city-state has set up fast tracks for short-term business travelers, allowing visitors from specific countries to avoid quarantine.    but even then, ""they're saying general travel is unlikely until even the second quarter of next year,"" he notes.   in terms of which countries face the most pressure to reopen, eunice aw, singapore director of global hospitality consulting firm horwath htl, singles out thailand.  ""thailand's travel business is probably one of the hardest hit among the southeast asian countries given that it welcomed the highest number of international visitors, at close to 40 million, in 2019,"" she tells cnn travel.  ""well-known for its cuisine, culture and beaches, it has been a perennial favorite with tourists from all over the globe. ""  according to the world bank, tourism normally makes up nearly 15% of thailand's gdp.   the country has fared well in the battle against coronavirus, going 101 days without reporting a locally transmitted case, until early september.   it remains closed to international tourists, but that could soon change.  the government announced last week it's creating a special 90-day long-stay visa for international tourists, a plan it hopes to implement by october.   deputy government spokesperson traisuree taisaranakul says the special tourism visa will be available for foreigners intending to stay in thailand for a long period and will cost 2,000 baht ($64).  requirements include quarantining in a hotel room or hospital for 14 days.   tourism authority of thailand governor suttasak supasorn tells cnn travel any hotel can receive these special tourists, ""as long as they are certified by the ministry of public health. "" ""we hope to start this as soon as october but this also depends on the demand side as well,"" he says.  once travelers complete their 14 days of quarantine and their covid-19 test is negative, they can travel all around thailand.   ""after the end of quarantine, they will be treated just like thai nationals who return from abroad,"" says suttasak.  ""we have received some positive interest, especially from the european market.  our representatives around the world have received enquiries. ""    elsewhere in the region: a mixed response to reopening prior to the pandemic, vietnam was one of the region's fastest growing tourism destinations.  according to a 2019 report from the world bank, it capitalized on surging global and regional demand over the previous three years, allowing it to achieve record growth in terms of both international and domestic visitors.   ""more than 15 million foreigners now visit vietnam each year, compared to only 4 million a decade ago, alongside roughly 80 million domestic traveler-trips, which have similarly quadrupled in number over the past 10 years,"" said the report.   in recent days, vietnam's government has expressed an interest in opening air corridors with its neighbors, but nothing concrete has been announced as of yet.    international commercial flights into vietnam from several asian destinations resumed this month, however, the flights are not yet open to leisure tourists.  meanwhile, hong kong officials confirmed to cnn travel that they're exploring possible travel corridors with 11 countries that have close economic/tourism ties and where the epidemic has stabilized.   these are: japan, thailand, south korea, australia, new zealand, germany, france, switzerland, vietnam, malaysia and singapore.   an inter-departmental team has reportedly been set up to discuss the proposal with the countries on its list.   but proving just how challenging it is to actually solidify such proposals, officials from south korea's tourism ministry told cnn travel that they have no plans to reopen to international tourism yet and there are no plans or discussions about a possible travel bubble, either.   as for japan -- another travel favorite that was gearing up for a huge tourism windfall following years of preparations to host the now postponed summer olympics -- no leisure tourism reopening plans have been announced.  the country has only just started allowing reentry to some foreign residents.   the indonesian island of bali, meanwhile, had planned to reopen to international tourism on september 11, which would have allowed them to capitalize on the chinese golden week holiday in early october.   but that plan was shelved as covid-19 cases continued to rise in the country.   ""you can set a hard deadline to try to reopen tourism, but you've still got to negotiate the agreement in the current context for people to come,"" says bowerman.   ""the problem was that bali doesn't really set the reopening rules -- that's the indonesian government.  they'd have to negotiate with the chinese government and the chinese government clearly was not going to allow its tourists to go to indonesia when the case rates are so high. ""  chinese tourists staying home china recovered from the virus relatively quickly due to its strict lockdown measures, though blips have occurred, such as a fresh outbreak in beijing in june.  prior to covid-19 grounding all tourists, china was the world's largest market for outbound travel, leaping from 4. 5 million travelers in 2000 to 150 million in 2018.  the country accounted for $277 billion or 16% of the world's total $1. 7 trillion international tourism spending, according to the unwto.  now, with the virus under control, they're traveling within their own borders as those who do head overseas have to quarantine for 14 days upon their return.   travel analytics company forward keys released a report in august predicting that domestic air travel in china would reach a full recovery by the start of september.  ""in the second week of august, domestic arrivals at chinese airports reached 86% of 2019 levels and bookings (issued air tickets) hit 98%, with most being for travel in mid to late august,"" said the report.   however, those hoping chinese tourists will be ready to head abroad for the 2021 february spring festival/lunar new year period are likely out of luck.    ""in my personal opinion, i believe mainland chinese travelers will likely spend their new year traveling domestically and that international destinations won't benefit from the vast amount of overseas trips from china until 2022,"" says pata's hardy.   maldives defies the norm not everyone is keeping their doors shut to international tourists.  the maldives is a rare outlier in that it's now welcoming all visitors, from all countries, with no quarantine restrictions.    the island nation reopened on july 15.  visitors are only allowed on the resort islands, and they need to book their entire stay in one registered establishment.   initially, medical certificates showing a negative covid-19 pcr test were not required, but the government changed that rule from september 11, due to a rise in case numbers.    the country is in a far better position than most to isolate visitors.  the maldives is made up of 26 atolls filled with over 1,000 islands occupied by dozens of resorts, all spread out over 90,000 square kilometers.  most of the islands developed for tourism feature just a single resort.  this means if guests or staff come into contact with someone who tests positive for covid-19, in theory they will be easily traceable, while the potential for spread is kept to a minimum.   europe's summer experiment asia's cautious approach to reopening contrasts starkly with that of europe, where many countries opened their borders in june to ensure tourism businesses would have some income over the popular summer months.    a recent report by the unwto states that 115 destinations (53% of all destinations worldwide) have eased covid-19

2020-05-05,"Billions of people could live in areas too hot for humans by 2070, study says","if the planet continues to warm at current levels over the next 50 years, up to 3 billion people could be living in areas that are too hot for humans, a new study has found.   for thousands of years, humans have lived within a narrow ""climate niche"" where average temperatures are ideal for society to flourish, and conditions favorable to grow food and keep livestock.  in findings published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences on monday, an international team of archaeologists, climate scientists and ecologists said that if heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions continue at the current pace, by 2070 billions of people will be living in conditions hotter than those that have allowed life to thrive for the past 6,000 years.  for every 1°c (1. 8°f) of warming, 1 billion people will either have to migrate to cooler regions or adapt to extreme heat conditions, the study found.   tim kohler, an archaeologist at the university of washington and co-author of the study said that these findings can be viewed as a worst case or ""business-as-usual"" scenario of ""what could happen if we don't change our ways. "" temperatures changing more than in past 6,000 years using data on historical global temperatures and the distribution of human populations, the researchers found that just like other species of animals, humans thrive best within a narrow ""climatic envelope"" around the world.   most of the world's population live in areas with a mean annual temperature of between 11 and 15 degrees celsius (51. 8 to 59 degrees fahrenheit).  a smaller band of between 20 to 25 °c (68 to 77°f) encompasses areas in south asia that are affected by the indian monsoon -- the annual rains that irrigates large swathes of cropland vital for food production.   surprisingly, the scientists said, humans have favored living in these conditions for the past 6,000 years -- that's despite recent technological advances such as air conditioning that have allowed us to push this boundary.  ""as an archaeologist i always tell my students that our technology, our minds, and our cumulative culture have enabled us to live anywhere,"" kohler said.  ""that's true of course.  but it turns out that there is a distinct climate zone in which our numbers are greatest, and within which we have also been most economically productive. "" but change could soon be forced upon us.  the earth is currently on track for 3°c of warming by 2100.  the study suggests that because land areas are warming faster than the oceans, temperatures experienced by humans are likely to rise by about 7. 5°c by 2070.  as our planet rapidly heats up due to rising emissions, the temperature experienced by an average person is projected to change more in the coming decades than it has over the past 6,000 years, the study found.   and it could have severe consequences for food production, access to water sources, conflict and disruption caused by migration.   ""it's reasonable to conclude that if something has been reasonably stable for 6000 years, we're not going to change it painlessly or quickly,"" kohler said.   extreme heat areas will expand among the hottest places on earth is the sahara region of africa, which experiences annual mean temperatures above 29°c (84. 2°f).  these extreme conditions cover 0. 8% of the earth's land area.  however, researchers said that those extreme heat areas are expected to spread to 19% of the earth's surface, affecting 3. 5 billion people by 2070.   regions that stand to be affected include parts of sub-saharan africa, south america, india, southeast asia, arabian peninsula and australia -- regions with fast-growing populations, said chi xu, from nanjing university's school of life sciences, and another co-author of the report.   ""those countries are mostly in global south, with the fastest population growing rate, such as india and nigeria.  these two countries are projected to accommodate the largest populations under extreme temperature conditions,"" chi said.   the study's projection of 3. 5 billion possible climate migrants goes far beyond the world bank estimates, which suggested 143 million people across south asia, sub-saharan africa and latin america were at risk of being displaced.  it's a dire warning of what could happen if the climate crisis is left unchecked.   but there is hope.  the scientists said that by rapidly and substantially reducing global carbon emissions, the number of people exposed to brutally hot conditions could be halved.   the authors explain that there are a number of uncertainties with how the climate crisis will fuel displacement and to what extent, and said the study can't be used as a prediction of migration.  the figures are also based on worst case projections and there are questions over how actions to mitigate against climate change, including ""political developments, institutional changes, and socioeconomic conditions"" may affect these outcomes.  ""the worst case scenario can be largely avoided if effective cut of greenhouse gas emissions is achieved,"" chi said.  ""many effective measures of climate mitigation and local adaptation would help to alleviate the negative influence of climate change on human societies.

2020-04-29,"China's model of control has been blamed for the coronavirus crisis, but for some it's looking increasingly attractive","on sunday, andrew adonis, a member of britain's house of lords and onetime cabinet minister, took aim at the idea that the coronavirus pandemic was causing a crisis of capitalism.   ""lots of instant commentary on 'how covid-19 will change the world' calls it a 'crisis of capitalism'.  wrong,"" he wrote on twitter.  ""it's a 'crisis of communism'.  it became a global pandemic through xi's communist regime china. ""  while it's debatable how communist modern china actually is, adonis is not alone in his complaint.  numerous western politicians, particularly on the right, have blamed china's government and political system for causing the current global crisis.  many have continued to hammer phrases such as ""china flu"" or ""wuhan virus,"" despite warnings that such terms could lead to increased hostility against asians.  even those critics who try to avoid ethnically-tinged labels often speak of a ""cpc virus"" or ""xi flu,"" named after country's ruling party, the communist party of china and its leader, president xi jinping, respectively.   it's safe to say that china's brand has taken a hit due to the virus.  according to pew research, americans' opinion of china is at its lowest point in 15 years, and 62% of those surveyed said they viewed china's power and influence as a ""major threat. ""  but for some, the beijing model is not necessarily looking so bad.  china, despite being where the virus first emerged, has coped with the ensuing pandemic far better than many other countries, even though those countries had a longer warning time and greater chance to prepare.   the crisis has also highlighted the benefits of a strong government and centralized planning, while -- despite adonis's claims to the contrary -- exposing the limitations of private industry to respond quickly, particularly in the healthcare sector.   in the united states, which is often held up -- for better or worse -- as the example par excellence of a western democracy, the alternative to the chinese model appears to be somewhat chaotic.  far from a strong government, washington has found itself fighting with state officials, facing accusations of pilfering medical supplies and growing calls for greater state power.  meanwhile, us president donald trump has been accused of spreading disinformation and encouraging protests.   speaking to der spiegel earlier this month, german foreign minister heiko maas said the virus had exposed the problems at the heart of both the chinese and us models.  asked which was being proven superior, maas said ""neither. ""  ""china has taken some very authoritarian measures, while in the us, the virus was played down for a long time,"" he told the magazine.  ""there are two extremes, neither of which can be a model for europe. ""  new diplomacy while germany may be able to afford to strike out its own path -- and has seen success in dealing with the coronavirus -- other countries, forever pulled between the competing poles of beijing and washington, may be swayed by how the current crisis is playing out.   certainly, china's leaders, and their vast propaganda apparatus, have not been blind to the opportunity this presents.  for weeks state media has been playing up the disorder around the world as it praises beijing's own handling of the crisis, shoring up power and support at home -- but it has also taken aim at those already sympathetic to china who could be pulled further into the fold.   as the us has increasingly looked inward -- both due to the requirements of the crisis and trump's own ""america first"" instincts -- china has been playing up the importance of ""multilateralism,"" calling for the shoring up of global institutions and offering assistance to anyone that needs it.  in particular, china has emerged as the strongest defendant of the world health organization (who) as it faces pressure from washington.   ""the united nations will be 75 this year, covid-19 is reminding countries of the continuous, and increasing value of multilateralism in a closely connected world.  we will only halt covid-19 through solidarity.  no country can do it alone,"" the communist party-controlled state owned mouthpiece china daily said in an editorial this month.   this advocacy of international cooperation might once have been put forward by the us.  but just as china stepped into the role of free-trade defender as trump pulled back, so too is it attempting to occupy washington's traditional space at the un and other multinational bodies.   since march, xi has had at least two dozen phone calls with other world leaders.  speaking to trump last month, he said that ""the international community must respond together if it is to win this battle,"" according to a readout from beijing.   writing last month, the european union's minister for foreign affairs, josep borrell, said there is an ongoing ""global battle of narratives,"" in which ""china is aggressively pushing the message that, unlike the us, it is a responsible and reliable partner. "" in part, borrell said, this was through highlighting its assistance to other countries, such as by sending medical supplies and experts to aid with the coronavirus response.   this coronavirus diplomacy is paying off.  in a tweet (written in chinese) this month, iran's foreign minister javad zarif praised beijing for coming to his country's aid, saying the coronavirus was ""deepening the comprehensive strategic partnership between the two countries. "" serbian president aleksander vucic was shown on chinese state broadcaster cgtn kissing the country's flag as he greeted a support team sent from beijing.  ""serbian people will never forget this kindness, china is an old friend and will continue to be for generations to come,"" he said later.   nor is it only beijing's traditional allies expressing their gratitude.  speaking to italian media late last month, the country's ministry of foreign affairs, luigi di maio, said the coronavirus response proved his government's wisdom in signing up to xi's belt and road trade and infrastructure scheme.  ""those that mocked us for (that) must now admit that investing in this friendship has allowed us to save lives in italy,"" di maio said, according to la stampa.   china has been gradually increasing its influence among eu member states, particularly those from eastern europe.  now, as the bloc faces the fallout of what appears to be a bungled coronavirus response, beijing will not want to miss another opportunity to win friends and favors.   china model  discussion of china's influence usually focuses on the country's vast economy, and certainly trade ties have been useful in the past for gaining new allies.  but this isn't the only selling point for beijing's new fans.   just as crises around fake news and online disinformation have made it easier for china to push its model of internet sovereignty -- one that has been happily embraced by those governments already keen to censor online dissent -- so too has the current pandemic provided an opportunity and an excuse to pursue the type of authoritarian power exercised by beijing.   last month, the council of europe warned that hungary -- long the eu's least democratically inclined member -- risked jeopardizing ""democracy, rule of law and human rights"" in its coronavirus response.  states across the middle east have used the virus as an opportunity to ramp up surveillance and controls on their populations, while in the philippines, a group of lawyers has warned that emergency powers granted to president rodrigo duterte are ""tantamount to autocracy. "" but for those pushing these changes, china could be perceived to be a strong argument that an empowered state is what is needed to respond to the pandemic.  regardless of the many valid criticisms of how beijing initially handled the crisis, it appears to have been able to get its domestic epidemic under control and the economy back on track better than many other countries.   the us government, meanwhile, presents something of an uneasy contrast: with a president musing about whether ingesting disinfectants could be used to treat the virus and encouraging protesters to demand an end to quarantine measures.   of course, the us is not the only model of a democracy, and the american system is actually something of an outlier compared to much of the developed world.  nor have other democracies struggled to cope with the virus in the same way: many of the governments praised for their handling of the virus -- taiwan, new zealand, australia, south korea and germany -- are democracies.  it is how a government uses power, not how it has it in the first place, which appears to be the overriding factor in an effective epidemic response.   but just as ""communist"" china has always been a convenient specter for those railing against left-wing policies or a strong government in the west, so too is ""democratic"" us a handy foil for opponents of liberalism in china and elsewhere.   brand china may be suffering as a result of the pandemic, but it is not the only one.  beijing also appears to have a greater appreciation than most of its rivals of the potential opportunities presented by the current crisis to emerge stronger and more influential than ever before.
