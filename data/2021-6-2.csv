2021-06-02,China's Xi calls for greater global media reach.,"shanghai: china president xi jinping said that the country must improve the way it tells its ""stories"" to a global audience as it seeks to develop an international voice that reflects its status on the world stage, official news agency xinhua reported. speaking at a communist party study meeting, xi said it was crucial for china to improve its ability to spread its messages globally in order to present a ""true, three-dimensional and comprehensive china"", xinhua said on tuesday (jun 1). china needed to develop an ""international voice"" to match its national strength and global status, xinhua said, citing xi. it also needed to strengthen propaganda efforts to help foreigners understand the chinese communist party and the way it ""strives for the happiness of the chinese people"". the country needed to create a team of professionals and adopt ""precise communication methods"" for different regions, he said. china's relationship with foreign media has become increasingly tense in recent years, with local news outlets such as the global times often singling out foreign reporters for what it says is biased and unfair coverage. several journalists working for united states news organisations were expelled last year as relations between the two sides deteriorated. china has also banned bbc world news from mainland chinese television networks following criticism of the british broadcaster's coverage of human rights in the north-western region of xinjiang as well as the origins of the covid-19 pandemic. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

                                    TSMC's Japan project attracts over 20 participant companies.","japan semiconductor industry pitches in cutting-edge materials and equipmenttokyo -- the japanese government on monday was set to finalize a plan in which it has enlisted taiwan semiconductor manufacturing co.  to develop cutting-edge chipmaking technologies in japan. the ministry of economy, trade and industry has been concerned about the japanese semiconductor industry's declining position in the global market, which led it to seek tsmc's cooperation. tsmc, the world's biggest contract chipmaker, intends to bear around half the project's cost of about 37 billion yen ($337 million).  over 20 japanese companies -- including ibiden, which is strong in chip packaging -- will participate. the japanese government -- which intends to establish a joint public-private sector concern to cooperate with tsmc -- expects the effort to pay off with improved international competitiveness for japanese industry. construction of a trial facility will begin this summer at the earliest at the national institute of advanced industrial science and technology, in tsukuba, ibaraki prefecture.  full-blown research and development work will begin as early as 2022. the chip industry is nearing limits in some crucial areas, including in the thinning of wires so semiconductors can have ever greater processing power. now the taiwanese company, which has led the global industry in miniaturization, is embarking on another strategy to make the more powerful and sophisticated chips of tomorrow -- cooperate with japanese companies and harness their strengths in materials and manufacturing equipment. part of tsmc's plan is to come up with so-called 3d packaging technology -- which vertically layers semiconductors -- and to do so in japan. ibiden is a global leader in packaging technology. other companies participating in the project include asahi kasei, a materials maker known for its ultrathin wiring; shin-etsu chemical, which makes a new heat-dissipating material; nagase & co. , a molding materials specialist; and shibaura mechatronics, a manufacturing equipment producer. there is a significant advantage for japan's atrophying semiconductor industry to collaborate with tsmc, and the japanese government intends to partially finance the project by using a fund established to promote the development of next-generation semiconductors. it is likely that japan is cooperating with tsmc on the condition that the taiwanese company set up a manufacturing operation in japan. sign up to our newsletters to get our best stories delivered straight to your inbox. discover the all new nikkei asia appdiscover the all new nikkei asia appstay ahead with our exclusives on asia; the most dynamic market in the world. stay ahead with our exclusives on asiaget trusted insights from experts within asia itself. get trusted insights from experts within asia itself.

2021-06-02,Malaysia says 16 Chinese jets threatened its sovereignty.,"keep up to speed at a glance with the top 10 daily storieskuala lumpur, malaysia (ap) — malaysia's air force said tuesday that 16 chinese military jets flew in a tactical formation over the south china sea and nearly infringed on the country's airspace, calling it a threat to malaysia's sovereignty. the air force said its radar picked up the jets flying in an ""in-trail"" formation near malaysian airspace in eastern sarawak state on borneo on monday. it said the jets then headed near malaysian-administered luconia shoals, a rich fishing ground in the disputed south china sea before moving nearly 60 nautical miles (110 kilometers) off the coast of sarawak.  after attempts to engage the jets failed, the air force said it sent planes to identify them. it found the planes were ilyushin il-76 and xian y-20 strategic transporters flying at altitudes between 23,000 and 27,000 feet. the air force said it reported the flights to the foreign ministry. ""this incident is a serious threat to national sovereignty and flight safety due to the air traffic density over the airways,"" it said in a statement. foreign ministry and chinese embassy officials couldn't be reached immediately for comment. china claims almost the entire south china sea.  brunei, malaysia, the philippines, taiwan and vietnam also have overlapping claims.  tensions have ramped up since china began a massive land reclamation program in 2013. the strategically important area has some of the world's busiest sea lanes and is also rich in fisheries and may hold underground oil and natural gas reserves. malaysia says chinese coast guard and navy ships intruded into its waters in the south china sea 89 times between 2016 and 2019.  malaysia has sent six diplomatic protests to china, including one in 2017 in response to a chinese note asserting its claim to the south luconia shoals. we look at both industrial reits to suss out which makes a better buy.  the post better buy: keppel dc reit vs mapletree industrial trust appeared first on the smart investor. all 26 hua zai eating house outlets will be closed from 1 june for two weeks and re-open on 15 june following the detection of covid-19 cases linked to an outlet at anchorvale, the ministry of health (moh) said on tuesday (1 june). !malaysia scrambled jets to intercept 16 chinese military aircraft off the country's coast in the south china sea, a rare incident that the foreign minister angrily denounced tuesday as an ""intrusion"". china has jailed a popular blogger for ""defaming martyrs"" after he suggested the death toll of the china-india border clash last year was higher than the official count of four. missed out on the recent hdb bto may sales launch?

2021-06-02,"Court case of 47 HK activists to resume on July 8, East Asia News & Top Stories.","read 3 articles daily and stand to win st rewards, including the st news tablet worth $398. spin the wheel for st read and win now. hong kong • the widely monitored national security case of 47 hong kong opposition figures charged with conspiracy to commit subversion, most of whom have been in custody for the past three months, will resume on july 8, a judge ruled yesterday. defendants will receive evidence against them before june 28 and they can make a plea at their next appearance in the west kowloon court.  the case may then be moved to the high court, which has the power to give longer sentences. some lawyers argued defendants could not be expected to make a plea so soon, given the national security law was new and it would take longer than usual to analyse the evidence.  judge victor so dismissed the request. ""seven days is the law,"" he said, referring to the deadline given to the prosecution to present the evidence. the 47 were arrested on charges of participating in an unofficial, non-binding and independently organised primary vote last year to select candidates for a since-postponed city election, which the authorities say was a ""vicious plot"" to subvert the government. around a hundred supporters gathered outside the court, waving smartphone flashlights and chanting ""hong kongers, hang in there"". ""i want to tell my friends among the 47 that they don't need to worry, as many are determined to fight on,"" activist jerry yuen said outside the court. the charges against the activists, many of whom have announced their retirement from politics, are punishable with up to life in prison. diplomats and rights groups are closely watching the case amid mounting concerns over the independence of the former british colony's judicial system, which is seen as the foundation on which its financial prowess was built. marathon bail hearings in march lasted four days and dragged late into the night, causing several defendants to fall ill and seek hospital treatment.  most of the subsequent appeals for bail have been denied. on friday, high court judge esther toh denied former lawmaker claudia mo's bail application, citing among other reasons her whatsapp messages with foreign journalists commenting on news. in denying bail in mid-march to jeremy tam, another former lawmaker, ms toh cited an e-mail he received from the us consulate where he was invited to ""catch up"".  his lawyers said he never replied. ten of the defendants are expected to apply for bail again today and tomorrow. the security law sets a high threshold for defendants seeking bail to demonstrate they would not break the law, a departure from common law practice, which puts the onus on prosecutors to make their case for detention as an exception. the protracted hearings and the reasons for rejecting bail have stunned diplomats and rights groups, who see it as a dramatic display of the chinese-ruled city's authoritarian turn. beijing's office that oversees matters in hong kong has also warned of threats made to a judge who sentenced media tycoon jimmy lai and other democracy activists for their roles in an unauthorised assembly on oct 1, 2019. a representative for the hong kong and macau affairs office (hkmao) said the presiding judge had received threatening phone calls, which the office said would not be tolerated. ""this is a serious threat to the personal safety of judges, a flagrant challenge to the judicial system in hong kong and a gross violation of the rule of law and order in hong kong,"" xinhua quoted a statement by hkmao as saying late on sunday. reutersjoin st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-06-02,Malaysian air force scrambles hawk jets after Chinese military planes detected near its national airspace.,"kuala lumpur: the malaysian air force said on tuesday (jun 1) that it scrambled its jets to conduct a visual confirmation, after chinese military transport planes were detected heading towards its national airspace and threatened the country's sovereignty. in a statement, the royal malaysian air force (rmaf) said it identified 16 people's liberation army air force (plaaf) planes making suspicious flights in malaysia's maritime zone air space, the kota kinabalu flight information region (fir) and approaching the malaysian national airspace on may 31. the planes were identified by the rmaf's defence radar in sarawak at 11. 53am, said the statement. it also said that the planes flew in an in-trail tactical formation 60 nautical miles from one another. ""the planes flew in that formation using the same point of entry and exit.  the planes then changed (direction), heading to the beting patinggi ali air space which is important to the country. ""the plaaf planes then flew via singapore fir before entering the malaysia maritime zone air space and the kota kinabalu fir, the rmaf statement said, adding that the chinese planes approached within 60 nautical miles of  sarawak beach, ""threatening malaysia's sovereignty"". the rmaf then put its hawk 208 jets from no.  6 squadron on high alert, said the statement. ""the plaaf planes were put under continued radar surveillance and were instructed to contact controllers in the kota kinabalu fir.  when these instructions were not heeded and the plaaf planes crossed kota kinabalu fir and headed towards the national airspace, the malaysia air force scrambled intercepting jets at 1. 33pm to perform a visual identification. """"as a result of the air interception carried out, the rmaf has identified the aircraft as ilyushin il-76 and xian y-20 aircraft.  these types of aircraft are strategic transport aircraft and capable of performing various missions.  this incident is a serious matter that threatens national sovereignty and aviation safety, based on the density of air traffic in the airline routes in kota kinabalu fir"". ""this incident was handled by the malaysian air force based on protocols by the icao and our national air defence strategy.  the foreign ministry has taken note of this through the defence ministry,"" the statement added. ""routine flight training""the chinese embassy in malaysia said on tuesday the planes were conducting routine flight training. ""as far as i know, the reported activities are routine flight training of the chinese air force and do not target any country,"" said a spokesperson. ""chinese military aircraft enjoy the freedom of overflight in the relevant airspace. ""during this training, the chinese military aircraft strictly abided by the relevant international law and did not enter the territorial airspace of any other country. ""the spokesperson said that china and malaysia are friendly neighbours, and that china is willing to continue bilateral friendly consultations with malaysia to jointly maintain regional peace and stability. malaysian foreign minister hishammuddin hussein said the ministry will issue a ""note of diplomatic protest"" and will ask china's ambassador to malaysia to explain the ""breach of the malaysian airspace and sovereignty"".

2021-06-02,Iran fails to explain uranium traces found at several sites: IAEA report.,"vienna: iran has failed to explain traces of uranium found at several undeclared sites, a report by the un nuclear watchdog showed on monday (may 31), possibly setting up a fresh diplomatic clash between tehran and the west that could derail wider nuclear talks. three months ago britain, france and germany scrapped a us-backed plan for the international atomic energy agency's 35-nation board of governors to criticise iran for failing to fully explain the origin of the particles; the three backed off as iaea chief rafael grossi announced fresh talks with iran. ""after many months, iran has not provided the necessary explanation for the presence of the nuclear material particles at any of the three locations where the agency has conducted complementary accesses (inspections),"" a report by grossi to member states seen by reuters said. it will now be up to the three european powers to decide whether to revive their push for a resolution criticising iran, which could undermine wider negotiations to revive the 2015 iran nuclear deal at talks currently underway in vienna.  grossi had hoped to report progress before the board meets again next week. ""the director general is concerned that the technical discussions between the agency and iran have not yielded the expected results,"" the report said. ""the lack of progress in clarifying the agency's questions concerning the correctness and completeness of iran's safeguards declarations seriously affects the ability of the agency to provide assurance of the peaceful nature of iran's nuclear programme,"" it added. in a separate quarterly report also sent to member states on monday and seen by reuters, the agency gave an indication of the damage done to iran's production of enriched uranium by an explosion and power cut at its natanz site last month that tehran has blamed on israel. iran's quarterly increase in its stock of enriched uranium was the lowest since august 2019 at just 273kg, bringing the total to 3,241kg, according to an iaea estimate.  it was not able to fully verify the stock because iran has downgraded cooperation. that total is many times the 202. 8kg limit set by the nuclear deal, but still well below the more than six tonnes iran possessed before the deal. damage to natanzat iran's main enrichment plant, which is underground at natanz, the agency verified on may 24 that 20 cascades, or clusters, of different types of centrifuges were being fed with uranium hexafluoride feedstock for enrichment.  a senior diplomat said that before the explosion that figure was 35-37. after washington pulled out of the nuclear deal in 2018 under president donald trump and re-imposed crippling economic sanctions against tehran, iran began breaching the deal's restrictions on its nuclear activities as of 2019. one of its more recent breaches, enriching uranium to 60 per cent, a big step towards weapons-grade from the 20 per cent it had previously reached and the deal's 3. 67 per cent limit, continued.  the iaea estimated that iran had produced 2. 4kg of uranium enriched to that level and 62. 8kg of uranium enriched to up to 20 per cent. iran's production of experimental quantities of uranium metal, which is prohibited under the deal and has prompted protests by western powers because of its potential use in the core of nuclear weapons, also continued.  iran produced 2. 42kg, the iaea reported, up from 3. 6 grams three months ago. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

""our seniors have always been the priority of the government in our effort to protect our people against covid-19, as they are more vulnerable, and we would like to see all of them vaccinated,"" she said in a facebook post on tuesday (june 1). the president acknowledged that some may have concerns about side effects. ""the vaccine is safe, and the strongest testimony to that is the 760,000 who are already vaccinated,"" she said, adding that she and her husband both in their 60s have also received their shots. madam halimah also urged neighbours or friends to help seniors who may not have family to assist them with the vaccination process. ""grassroots organisations or social service agencies can also assist,"" she said. ""in this way, hopefully we can see all our seniors quickly vaccinated. ""the straits times visited three vaccination centres located at community clubs (ccs) on tuesday, all of which saw seniors walking in to get their shots. at radin mas cc, around 10 seniors arrived at 7. 30am without appointments, while at marsiling cc, around eight such seniors had trickled in by noon.  tanjong pagar cc saw 21 such walk-ins by 1pm. one senior, 64-year-old chua ah poh, said she missed her vaccination appointment in april because she had been unwell. the cleaner said she decided to go to the centre this afternoon to receive her jab after hearing pm lee's pitch on monday and also with encouragement from her family. she said in mandarin: ""all my family members have received the vaccination, so i think it's better for me to get it as soon as possible to be safe and prevent anything from happening.

2021-06-02,"Audio House customer data possibly stolen by hackers, Tech News News & Top Stories.","read 3 articles daily and stand to win st rewards, including the st news tablet worth $398. spin the wheel for st read and win now. singapore customers of consumer electronics retailer audio house may have had their personal details, such as names and contact numbers, stolen by a hacking group that had allegedly hacked furniture retailer vhive. audio house told customers in an e-mail that it was alerted on monday (may 31) that hacking group altdos might have gained unauthorised entry into its servers. the group claimed to have accessed the retailer's membership database, stolen information from it and used the data to blackmail audio house, the retailer added. the company is now working with the police and other authorities, as well as a team of web experts, to ascertain if its servers had been breached and to what extent. the police confirmed a report was lodged and they are investigating the matter. audio house told the straits times that its database contains information of about 180,000 customers, adding that altdos had threatened the company through e-mails, which it has not responded to. it said altdos had used fear tactics to pressure the company to pay it, as well as use audio house as a case study to blackmail other firms in future. in previous hacking incidents, altdos, operating mainly in south-east asia, had stolen customer data from companies, blackmailed the compromised firm, leaked the data online when their demands were not met, and publicised the breaches. in the audio house breach, the data that could have been stolen included members' names, e-mail addresses, home delivery addresses, contact numbers, credits with the company, and members' past sales transaction records. audio house said all customer payment details and credit card information are handled by a third party payment gateway, so no credit card information was stored or possibly breached. ""all our members' ecashback and credits are safely stored with us, and you will still be able to use them in your purchases with us,"" the firm said. the retailer added it had strengthened its firewall and the system's security after the incident, and had suspended its website temporarily to conduct more tests and the firewall upgrade. apologising for the potential breach, audio house advised customers who receive any spam e-mails from altdos not to respond to it. the company also urged customers not to spread unverified information about the incident that could bolster the hacking group's efforts. those who need help can contact audio house.  altdos had previously claimed responsibility for hacking vhive. the furniture retailer had said its server was hacked on march 23. compromised information included customers' names, physical and e-mail addresses and mobile numbers, but did not include identification numbers or financial information, said the furniture retailer. in an e-mail to affected customers in early april, altdos said it managed to hack into vhive three times in nine days and claimed to have stolen information related to more than 300,000 customers and nearly 600,000 transaction records. the group said it would leak 20,000 customer records daily, until its demands to vhive's management were met. cyber-security experts had previously said personal details stolen by hackers could be used by cyber criminals to, among other things, send victims personalised phishing e-mails that would allow them to steal passwords or drop ransomware to lock up digital files until the crooks are paid. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-06-02,Can I have the Covid-19 vaccine if I'm pregnant? A look at the latest guidance.,"pregnant women are being offered the pfizer and moderna vaccines but anyone who has had a first dose of oxford/astrazeneca should also have a second dose of thisget the latest email updates for surrey with our free daily newsletterthe vaccination programme is well under way and has been a huge success so far, but many people may still have questions about what they can or cannot do.  one of those key questions is whether women can have the covid-19 vaccine if they're pregnant, with advice having changed over time.   in short, the answer is 'yes', but there is some important information to be aware of.  surreylive has looked at the government guidance and has provided the key information below.  the vaccines do not contain live coronavirus and cannot infect a pregnant woman or her unborn baby in the womb. the guidance reads: ""covid-19 vaccines offer pregnant women the best protection against covid-19 disease which can be serious in later pregnancy for some women. ""the first dose of covid-19 vaccine will give you good protection.  you need the second dose to get longer lasting protection.  you do not need to delay this second dose. ""pregnant women should have the same vaccine for their first and second doses, unless they have a serious side effect after the first dose. the government guidance says: ""it's recommended you have the same vaccine for both doses. ""if you had the oxford/astrazeneca vaccine for your first dose and did not have any serious side effects you should have it for your second dose. "" if your first dose was the astrazeneca (az) vaccine, you should consider the information in the covid-19 vaccination and blood clotting leaflet. signing up to the surreylive newsletter means you'll receive our daily news email. it couldn't be simpler and it takes seconds simply press here, enter your email address and follow the instructions. you can also enter your address at the top of this page in the box below the picture on most desktop and mobile platforms. changed your mind? there's an 'unsubscribe' button at the bottom of every newsletter we send out. however, the pfizer and moderna vaccines are now the preferred vaccines for pregnant women. this is because they have been more widely used during pregnancy in other countries and have not caused any safety issues. the guidance says: ""in the usa, around 90,000 pregnant women have been vaccinated mainly with pfizer and moderna vaccines and no safety concerns have been identified. ""the joint committee on vaccination and immunisation (jcvi) has advised that pregnant women should be offered the vaccines at the same time as people of the same age or risk group.  the guidance says: ""you can book your covid-19 vaccination online.  ""if you're under 40, you'll only be shown appointments for the pfizer/biontech or moderna vaccine.  if you're 40 or over, you'll be asked if you're pregnant to make sure you're only shown appointments for these vaccines. ""at your appointment, you'll be able to discuss the benefits and potential risks of having the vaccine in pregnancy.  this is so you can make an informed decision about having it.  you can also speak to a gp or your maternity team for advice. ""most of the side effects from the vaccines are mild and short-term, and not everyone gets them. very common side effects in the first day or two include: flu-like symptoms are also possible, with episodes of shivering and shaking for a day or two.  you can rest and take the normal dose of paracetamol (follow the advice in the packaging) to help you feel better.  although feeling feverish is not uncommon for two to three days, a high temperature is unusual and may indicate you have covid-19 or another infection.  in this instance you should take a coronavirus test. symptoms following a vaccination normally last less than a week, but if your symptoms seem to get worse or if you are concerned, call nhs 111.  for more information on what to expect after a vaccine, see here.

2021-06-02,Opinion.,"the united states could take a lesson from what's happening this week in israel, where two radically diverging wings of israeli politics have united in opposing the polarizing government of prime minister benjamin netanyahu. naftali bennett and yair lapid couldn't disagree more about big issues.  bennett is an orthodox jewish former settler leader who wants to annex the west bank; lapid is a secular jew who favors a two-state solution to the palestinian problem.  yet the two joined forces last weekend for what supporters call a ""change government. "" the mission is to oust netanyahu and end the impasse in israeli politics he helped create. netanyahu is the ultimate political survivor.  he has remained prime minister for the past 12 years in part because of his genius at exploiting the divisions in israeli society for his own benefit.  he exploited ""wedge politics"" much like his political ally, former president donald trump.  he has kept his post despite a 2019 indictment on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust, and a trial that resumed in april, in which he has pleaded not guilty. but this week, netanyahu's threats and bluster finally seemed to have lost their bite.  lapid and bennett asked israeli president reuven rivlin for a mandate to form a government, and they appear to have the knesset votes to remove netanyahu.  we'll know by wednesday night whether they have succeeded. what has happened in israel to produce this extraordinary (if precarious) movement for national unity? partly it's frustration with the political impasse netanyahu produced as he held office through four inconclusive elections over the past two years.  partly, it's a feeling of disgust about netanyahu continuing to hold power even as he stands trial on charges that he abused it. most of all, i suspect, bennett and lapid have come together because of a shared passion for the well-being of their country.  and that's the point that i wish americans could learn from watching this episode.  this seems to be a moment where israel's version of ""red"" and ""blue"" states — people who disagree about fundamental issues — have decided to put those divisions aside because of something that's more important: national survival. bennett, the religious conservative, put it this way: ""two thousand years ago, there was a jewish state which fell here because of internal quarrels.  this will not happen again.  not on my watch. "" lapid, the secular centrist, also stressed the search for unity, ""to see if we can find in the coming days wise compromises for the sake of the big aim. ""one unsettling similarity between israeli and u. s.  politics is that netanyahu's die-hard supporters have been threatening violence in recent days, just as trump's supporters did in the jan.  6 insurrection.  gideon saar, a former netanyahu ally who supports the change coalition, warned: ""there is an incitement machine that is running .  .  .  an incitement machine that has nothing to do with ideology, but only with anxiety about the loss of power. ""avigdor liberman, another former netanyahu ally now backing change, specifically likened the threats and intimidation by netanyahu's supporters against those they view as traitors to the jan 6.  insurrection.  ""when i look at the legal attempt to torpedo the [coalition] government .  .  .  i see what happened on the capitol hill happening here.  i hope it's just a nightmare scenario,"" liberman said. i've watched lapid and bennett speak many times in tel aviv at conferences held by the institute for national security studies.  it's hard to imagine two more different people — in style, temperament and ideology.  they have competing visions of the future of the state.  but what they share is a belief that the nation and its institutions come first. ""the country is paralyzed because [netanyahu] only cares for himself,"" argues amos yadlin, a retired israeli air force general who headed military intelligence and recently retired as head of the institute for national security studies.  he argued that the tipping point wasn't a disagreement about national security, where israelis are united except for the palestinian issue — it was exasperation with netanyahu, known in israel as ""bibi. """"bibi took our political norms to an unacceptable level .  .  .  by inciting and dividing the people,"" yadlin told me in a phone interview tuesday.  the diverse coalition for change emerged, he said, because ""bibi put himself before the country,"" and it was time ""to normalize again our political system. ""the change coalition won't solve all israel's problems.  but it will reinforce the fundamentals of israeli democracy — and the need for people to unite, even when they disagree bitterly over policy.  let's hope americans experience the same revelation before it's too late. read more:max boot: republicans are far more radical than democrats on israelraphael mimoun: zionism cannot produce a just

2021-06-02,"Employer's family of 12 put under quarantine after maid tests positive for Covid-19 despite early SHN release, Singapore News & Top Stories.","read 3 articles daily and stand to win st rewards, including the st news tablet worth $398. spin the wheel for st read and win now. singapore when a hotel worker hired a new maid to care for her elderly parents, she did not think it would lead to a covid-19 scare and quarantine for her family of 12. the indonesian maid, who arrived here on april 15, was discharged from stay-home notice (shn) only five days later, despite testing positive for her polymerase chain reaction (pcr) test. the employer, who wanted to be known only as ms lee, 32, was worried if the maid's early discharge was safe, so she checked with the isolation facility where the helper was quarantined. she was told not to worry because the helper's serology test came back positive, indicating that it was a past infection. her worst fears came true when the maid was retested and the results were positive an issue that came to light last week when former dj jade rasif said in a social media post that she had a similar experience. in ms lee's case, the helper arrived on april 21 at her home, where ms lee lives with her two elderly parents and her brother. two weeks later, on may 4, the helper tested positive in a mandatory swab test.  an ambulance took her to the national centre for infectious diseases (ncid). she was among several maids who had been released early from shn, only to test positive again a few weeks later.  since feb 5, maids and confinement nannies coming into singapore have had to do compulsory serology tests in addition to pcr tests. those who test positive for antibodies in their serology test are classified as recovered patients and can be released from shn. however, some of these maids were called back for swab tests over the past month, according to several maid agencies the straits times spoke to.  some then tested positive and were put in isolation. on may 16, ms rasif said in facebook and instagram posts that her helper tested positive for covid-19 after being released early from shn.  the manpower ministry (mom) has since clarified that the helper was not infectious and was shedding dead viral fragments. mr steve siva, director of maid agency unistarr employment, said the issue has raised concerns among employers and maids.  he said: ""we didn't expect domestic workers could still be potential covid-19 cases, as our understanding was that they were cleared. employers also have suffered.  ms lee's troubles began when her helper was first taken to ncid on may 4.  ""it was a shock, and it sent us all into confusion and panic because we didn't know what would happen, whether we needed to be quarantined.  nobody told us anything,"" she said. her two sisters and their families of four had also come into contact with the helper when they visited for a family dinner.  all of them decided to self-quarantine. the next day, ms lee received an e-mail that informed her that the helper was a suspected positive covid-19 case, but she and her family could continue their daily activities.  the helper then tested negative twice in a row. on may 8, after the maid was swabbed again, moh called ms lee to inform her that all 12 of them had to be under quarantine. ms lee said: ""we were speechless at this point.  we thought it was safe to go about our daily lives, and had met so many people at work and school. . .  we were also worried for the safety of our parents, who have chronic illnesses. ""ms lee and her family have finished their quarantine and cleared all their swab tests, but the maid's status remains unclear. she was discharged last tuesday after completing 21 days of isolation, with a memo that said she was no longer infectious.  however, ms lee said when she spoke to an moh doctor on may 21, she was told it was still unclear if the maid had been reinfected. she said: ""it's making us very jittery. . .  she went through multiple swab and blood tests, and we just find it unbelievable that there isn't anything on her infection status. ""another employer, rachel (not her real name), 55, said the maid she employs was taken away on may 2 after testing positive for covid-19 not knowing whether her family was safe and when the maid could return. she earlier got a call from the authorities and was told the maid had tested positive but that rachel and her family were not under quarantine. rachel, who did not want to be named to avoid causing alarm at the daycare facility her father visits, said: ""i was so frightened and sceptical because it was just over the phone. ""over the next three days, she worked from home and stopped sending her father to daycare.  she also called the moh hotline, but the officer could not provide any more details about the helper's status. rachel then received an e-mail from mom on may 5 that informed her that the maid was a ""positive suspect"", and that rachel could go about her daily activities.  she was allowed home on may 9 after it was confirmed she was not infected. rachel said the whole experience was frustrating because of the lack of information.  ""they took her away, and i was in the dark until they e-mailed me three days later, but in between, i couldn't do anything. ""mom said on may 22 that it was conducting an internal review of its communications and service delivery processes to ""better serve citizens and provide greater clarity on their concerns"". join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

the japanese government will contribute around 19 billion yen ($173 million) to a project led by taiwan semiconductor manufacturing co to develop chip-making technology in japan, the industry ministry said monday. the move comes as the government is struggling to improve the global competitiveness of japanese firms in research and development of advanced semiconductors indispensable for next-generation telecommunication networks and autonomous driving. over 20 japanese firms including electronics maker ibiden co and chemical company asahi kasei corp will join tsmc, the world's leading chipmaker, under the project, which will be based in tsukuba, ibaraki prefecture, near tokyo. races are intensifying around the world to strengthen the supply chains of chips, with many countries making huge investments to establish their own production bases to ensure progress in the digitalization of the economy. tsmc said in february it will establish a new development base in japan. the presence of japan's semiconductor industry has weakened in the face of competition from rivals in south korea and taiwan.  the ministry of economy, trade and industry is expected to unveil a strategy soon to enhance the competitiveness of the sector. 100% online and fully accredited, level 7 qualification for board directors.  over six months, develop the skills to become a confident and truly effective board membergood to see taiwan and japan working together. tsmc should watch out.  only reason for this is to steal superior technology from taiwan, just like japan stole camera technology from germany, and electronic technology from the us.  i will bet that this would also end up as a failure just like japan display did, since japanese leaders are hopeless with  decision making. @tom doleyyou might wanna take that statement back if you read about how tsmc rose dude. @shidhoorit's 2021.  not 2011.  get over it. taiwan is also helping to build a new semiconductor plant in the us, but it will be awhile before it comes online. @1glenntaiwan is also helping to build a new semiconductor plant in the us, but it will be awhile before it comes online. what tsmc is building in japan is a 20 nm fab, nothing cutting edge but good enough for japan's embedded chip makers.  there is no use for cutting edge 5 nm and 3 nm processes in japan because japanese chip makers have no use. what tsmc is building in the us is the cutting edge stuff, because of demands from us customers like apple and amd.  ditto for samsung, which is building the latest $20 billion 2nm fab in the us to serve customers like ibm, nvidia, qualcomm, and tesla. use your facebook account to login or register with japantoday.  by doing so, you will also receive an email inviting you to receive our news alerts. 100% online and fully accredited, level 7 qualification for board directors.  over six months, develop the skills to become a confident and truly effective board membera mix of what's trending on our other sites

2021-06-02,"US concerned at Chinese military presence in Cambodia, urges 'balanced' foreign policy.","phnom penh: the most senior us official to visit cambodia in years expressed concern on tuesday (jun 1) about china's military presence there and sought clarification on the demolition of us-funded buildings, the state department said. deputy secretary of state wendy sherman urged cambodia's leadership to ""maintain an independent and balanced foreign policy, in the best interests of the cambodian people"". she met prime minister hun sen, who has ruled for over 35 years and has become increasingly close to china while washington has condemned human rights abuses and his demolition of the political opposition. the pentagon said last year it was worried about reports that the cambodian navy tactical headquarters at ream naval base had been demolished and had asked cambodia for an explanation. the building, roughly 30 metres long, had housed several small patrol boats. in october, cambodia said it had razed the building to allow for further expansion and would relocate the demolished facility, denying reports of chinese involvement. a us state department spokesman said there was ""substantial"" publicly available evidence that china was working on a major renovation project at ream and said ""credible reports"" suggested this would include an area under its exclusive control. ""deputy secretary sherman expressed serious concerns about the prc's (china's) military presence and construction of facilities at ream naval base,"" the state department said in a statement. ""she sought clarification on the demolition of two us-funded buildings at ream without notification or explanation and observed that a prc military base in cambodia would undermine its sovereignty, threaten regional security, and negatively impact us-cambodia relations. ""china has become an increasingly important economic and political ally for cambodia. ties between china and the united states have deteriorated sharply in recent years over issues including human rights, trade and beijing's military expansion in the south china sea. cambodia is strategically situated with a gulf of thailand coastline and also belongs to the 10-member association of southeast asian nations.  washington sees close cooperation with asean as crucial to its efforts to counter beijing's growing regional influence. cambodian government spokesman phay siphan urged dialogue. ""there are some issues that the united states doesn't understand clearly about cambodia and that cambodia does not understand the intentions of the united states,"" he said. sherman, who also met opposition leader kem sokha, civil society groups and journalists. her trip is the first by such a senior us official since well before kem sokha's opposition party was banned in 2017.  a wider crackdown has targeted activists campaigning about issues such as illegal logging. sherman emphasised the importance of human rights and urged cambodia to abide by international commitments, the state department said. ""we hope this trip is a reminder to the cambodian regime that the us continues to be vigilant about rights and the destruction of democracy in cambodia as well as cambodia's role in being a responsible actor in the region,"" said opposition official monovithya kem, kem sokha's daughter. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

""they will not replace existing scientific names, but are aimed to help in public discussion,"" said dr maria van kerkhove, the who's covid-19 technical lead. under the new system, the variants of concern take on the following names: the hitherto so-called british variant b117 becomes alpha; the b1351 first detected in south africa becomes beta, while the brazilian p. 1 becomes gamma. the so-called indian variant b1617 is split into sub-lineages, of which the b16172 variant of concern becomes delta. the b16171 variant of interest is called kappa. besides these names, there are two other scientific names in use for each mutation, while different geographic names have been used to describe the same variant. for example, within britain, what other countries have been referring to as the british variant is often called the kent variant the county in south-east england where it was first detected. the lineage names such as b1172 will still continue to be used in scientific circles, for the mutation information that their name conveys. ""while they have their advantages, these scientific names can be difficult to say and recall, and are prone to misreporting,"" the who said in a statement. ""as a result, people often resort to calling variants by the places where they are detected, which is stigmatising and discriminatory.

""this transfer mechanism recognises how harassment may occur against the backdrop of other ongoing proceedings, such as divorce (ones),"" it stated. various changes to the protection from harassment act (poha) in order to enhance protection for victims of harassment will also kick in on tuesday. a victim applying for a po against his or her harasser need not prove that a provision in poha has been contravened, if the offender has already been convicted of any poha or hurt-related offence against him or her. judges granting epos in egregious cases of hurt or harassment will now be required to consider whether a criminal investigation is warranted and, if so, refer such cases to the police for investigation. pos and epos will be extended to protect people related to the victim, as these individuals may also be harassed by the same perpetrator. the new changes to poha will also make it clear that domestic exclusion orders, which restrain the respondent from entering the applicant's residence or parts of the residence, can also be granted as part of a po.

""while jaywalking by elderly pedestrians contributed to some of these accidents, many accidents also arise from irresponsible driving behaviour on the motorist's part, such as failing to slow down when approaching a pedestrian crossing. ""the situation may be improved with greater care on the part of motorists,"" said mha. for example, for failing to slow down or give way when approaching pedestrian crossings, offenders will incur eight demerit points, up from six, outside silver zones and school zones. driving or riding against the flow of traffic in these zones will likewise incur eight demerit points instead of six.  composition fines for light vehicles will be $300, up from $200, and $350 for heavy vehicles, up from $250. a motorist who runs a red light, which is a 12-demerit point offence when committed outside a silver zone and school zone, will incur 14 demerit points when committed in the zones. the motorist can be fined $500 instead of $400 for all vehicles.  this is the maximum composition fine for all 12-demerit-point offences, which is capped at half of the maximum court fine of $1,000. a composition fine allows an offence to be settled with a fine, without having to be convicted in court. mha said it will monitor accident rates for heavy vehicles in silver zones and school zones, and review the cap on composition fines if necessary. the stiffened measures for motorists in these zones come after other ongoing efforts by the traffic police to enhance road safety for elderly pedestrians.  these include public education for the elderly and enforcement measures for pedestrians at jaywalking hot spots. the land transport authority has also included additional crossing points and lanes with reduced width to slow down traffic at silver zones. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

'this is the maximum composition fine for all 12-demerit-point offences, which is capped at half of the maximum court fine of $1,000.', 'a composition fine allows an offence to be settled with a fine, without having to be convicted in court.', 'mha said it will monitor accident rates for heavy vehicles in silver zones and school zones, and review the cap on composition fines if necessary.', 'the

2021-06-02,China reports world's first H10N3 human infection case; 'no evidence of human-to-human transmission'.,"global times reporter on society, cybersecurity, diplomatic relations and topics related to xinjiang. photo:xinhuaeast china's jiangsu province has reported the world's first case of a human infected with h10n3 avian influenza.  china's health authorities said on tuesday that it was an occasional poultry-to-human transmission, and the risk of a large-scale spread is extremely low.  the patient is a 41-year-old man from zhenjiang, a city in jiangsu province.  the man had a fever and other symptoms on april 23 and was admitted to a local medical institute for treatment on april 28, according to a notice released by china's national health commission on tuesday. the entire genetic analysis of the virus obtained from the patient showed that he tested positive for the h10n3 virus, making him the first human case of h10n3.  the entire genetic analysis of the virus showed that the h10n3 virus was of avian origin and did not have the ability to effectively infect humans, experts summoned by nhc believed.  ""no human cases of h10n3 have been reported in the world, and the h10n3 virus among poultry is low pathogenic.  this case is an occasional poultry-to-human cross-species transmission, and the risk of a large-scale spread is extremely low,"" nhc said.  h10n3 is a subtype of the influenza a virus, also known as the bird flu virus.  h10n3 is normally lethal to wild birds and poultry, as it can spread through respiratory droplets among the animals, just like the flu and covid-19, said yang zhanqiu, a deputy director of the pathogen biology department at wuhan university. it is unknown how this person became infected, but he likely got infected from respiratory droplets of poultry or direct contact with sick live poultry, yang said. it presents a low risk to humans and there is no evidence to indicate that h10n3 virus can cause human-to-human transmission, yang said, adding that we should not overreact to the case, and more monitoring should be carried out to see how it spreads.  cases of humans infected with other types of avian influenza are common.  russia confirmed the first case of human infection with the avian influenza a(h5n8) virus in the world in february, xinhua news agency reported.  central china's hunan province confirmed a human infection case of the h5n6 bird flu virus in december 2020. among the various types of avian influenza, yang said the h5n1 type is highly pathogenic, with a fatality rate of between 40 and 50 percent.  the nhc has instructed jiangsu to carry out relevant epidemic prevention and control measures.  all close contacts of the patient have been put under medical observation.  local authorities have conducted emergency monitoring, with no abnormalities found so far.  the patient's condition is currently stable and is ready to be discharged from hospital, nhc announcement said.  nhc warned the public to avoid contact with sick or dead poultry and to try to avoid direct contact with live poultry.  the h5n8 strain of bird flu has been detected in seven workers at a poultry farm in russia, . . .

2021-06-02,Trudeau pledges 'concrete action' after mass indigenous student grave found.,"prime minister justin trudeau on monday expressed canada's grief while pledging ""concrete action"" in support of indigenous communities after remains of 215 indigenous children were discovered at an old boarding school. ""as a dad, i can't imagine what it would feel like to have my kids taken away from me,"" trudeau told a news conference.  ""and as prime minister, i am appalled by the shameful policy that stole indigenous children from their communities. """"think of their communities that never saw them again.  think of their hopes, their dreams, their potential, of all they would have accomplished, all they would have become,"" he said.  ""all of that was taken away. ""trudeau, who has made reconciliation with canada's nearly 1. 7 million indigenous people a priority of his government since coming to power in 2015, said he would speak with his ministers to shore up ""next and further things we need to do to support (residential school) survivors and the community. ""excavating school burial sites across canada, as many have urged, he also said, ""is an important part of discovering the truth. """"canada will be there to support indigenous communities as we discover the extent of this trauma and trying to give opportunities for families and communities to heal. ""the tk'emlups te secwepemc tribe said last week it had used ground-penetrating radar to confirm the remains of the students who attended a school near kamloops, british columbia. the kamloops indian residential school was the largest of 139 boarding schools set up in the late 19th century to assimilate canada's indigenous peoples, with up to 500 students registered and attending at any one time. it was operated by the catholic church on behalf of the canadian government from 1890 to 1969, before ottawa took over its administration and closed it a decade later. official records showed only 50 deaths at the school, where a principal once pleaded for more funds to properly feed students. children shoes tiny tributes -as the nation mourned, flags atop government buildings were lowered to half-mast over the weekend. row upon row of children's shoes were left in front of parliament in ottawa and on steps outside government offices and churches in several cities, forming makeshift memorials. about 100 people, several in ceremonial attire, also marched sunday in the mohawk community of kahnawake, near montreal. national chief of the assembly of first nations perry bellegarde was quoted by the globe and mail as saying former students and families ""deserve to know the truth. """"a thorough investigation into all former residential school sites could lead to more truths of the genocide against our people,"" he added. the british columbia coroner is helping the tk'emlups te secwepemc tribe establish the causes and timings of the student deaths in kamloops. on monday, opposition parties asked for -- and trudeau agreed to -- an emergency debate in parliament on the ""heart-breaking"" discovery. some 150,000 indian, inuit and metis youngsters in total were forcibly enrolled in these schools, where students were physically and sexually abused by headmasters and teachers who stripped them of their culture and language. today those experiences are blamed for a high incidence of poverty, alcoholism and domestic violence, as well as high suicide rates, in indigenous communities. a truth and reconciliation commission has identified the names of, or information about, at least 4,100 children who died from abuse or neglect while attending a residential school.  it estimates the actual toll is much higher. the commission concluded in a 2015 report that more than a century of abuses at the schools amounted to ""cultural genocide.

2021-06-02,"Without a Nuclear Deal, How Close Is Iran to a Bomb?.","three years after former president donald trump withdrew the u. s.  from a landmark nuclear agreement with iran, tehran's government is closer to having the material needed for a nuclear weapon than if the deal had remained in place.  iranians have enriched more uranium to higher levels using more sophisticated technologies than they would otherwise have had access to under a strict monitoring regime.  those developments have led president joe biden's administration to join diplomats from europe, china and russia in seeking to revive the 2015 agreement, which reined in tehran's atomic program in exchange for relief from economic sanctions. 1.  how close is iran to making a bomb?iran has accumulated enough enriched uranium (meaning it has an increased concentration of the isotope uranium-235) to construct several bombs should its leaders choose to purify the heavy metal to the 90% level typically used in weapons.  by producing 2. 4 kilograms (5. 3 pounds) of highly enriched uranium, purified to levels of 60%, the nation demonstrated that its engineers could quickly move to weapons-grade.  international atomic energy agency inspectors report iran has stockpiled more than 3,000 kilograms of low-enriched uranium, which typically has 3%-5% concentration of u-235, as well as 63 kilograms of the material enriched to 20% purity. 2.  why is enrichment so important?obtaining the material necessary to induce atomic fission is the most difficult step in the process of making nuclear power or bombs.  countries need to develop an industrial infrastructure to produce uranium-235 isotopes, which comprise less than 1% of matter in uranium ore but are key to sustaining a fission chain reaction.  thousands of centrifuges spinning at supersonic speeds are used to separate the material.  the iaea keeps track of gram-level changes in uranium inventories worldwide to ensure the material isn't being diverted for weapons.  whether or not iran retains the right to enrich uranium has been at the heart of its nuclear conflict with the u. s.  for two decades. 3.  did the 2015 deal slow iran's progress?yes.  the deal was written to ensure that even if it was someday broken, iran would need at least a year to restore weaponization capacity.  iran forfeited some 97% of its enriched uranium and mothballed three-quarters of the industrial capacity needed to refine the heavy metal.  before the accord, iran had enough to potentially build more than a dozen bombs.  iran always maintained it was pursuing nuclear energy, not nuclear weapons, but world powers doubted that claim. 4.  why did iran break its part of the agreement?president hassan rouhani waited a year after the trump administration reimposed sanctions before giving the orders to break the nuclear covenants set out by the accord.  over the last 18 months, iran has shown it could steadily lift its atomic capacity despite the best efforts of saboteurs and assassins to derail the program. 5.  can the deal be revived?biden promised during his presidential campaign that if iran returned to compliance with its obligations under the 2015 deal, the u. s.  would also return to the deal and lift sanctions.  diplomats bunkered down in vienna have conducted intensive talks over two months to revive the accord.  as of the beginning of june, they'd made substantial progress and were close to reinstituting the safeguards needed to ensure iran can't construct a weapon.  iran says it wants to repair the deal before president hassan rouhani leaves office in august.  the country's june 18 election is expected to favor political hardliners who are more hostile to the u. s.  and the nuclear agreement. 6.  what happens if the agreement is revived?to return to compliance with the deal's limits, iran would have to dramatically reduce uranium stockpiles and sideline much of its enrichment technology.  international inspectors would again have full access to places where nuclear material is produced, an important consideration as monitors continue parsing information about the country's alleged historical weapons-related activities.  iran would win reprieve from sanctions that hamstrung its exports of oil and other economic activities.  while some of the nuclear limitations in the deal begin to expire in 2025, diplomats expect follow-on talks to take place that would focus on regional security and iran's production of ballistic missiles. 7.  what happens if there's no deal?after entering the original deal in 2015, then-president barack obama said the alternative might have been a military conflict with major disruptions to the global economy.  over the last three years, the dispute between washington and tehran has roiled the wider middle east, fueling conflicts where iran and american allies are on opposing sides, with iran blamed for attacks on shipping in key waterways. more

2021-06-02,"Malaysians called out for breaking Covid-19 rules as total lockdown begins, SE Asia News & Top Stories.","read 3 articles daily and stand to win st rewards, including the st news tablet worth $398. spin the wheel for st read and win now. kuala lumpur less than a year ago, malaysia was hailed as a success story in the battle against the coronavirus pandemic, with fewer than 13,000 cases by early october. since then, it has chalked up over half a million covid-19 cases, hitting a daily record high of 9,020 cases last saturday (may 29). while many blame the government for poor pandemic management, officials and netizens lament that people are still failing to obey safety rules, including a ban on visiting during the hari raya celebrations last month, which led to numerous clusters forming. malaysia was on a partial movement control order at the time, and it remains to be seen how seriously people will take the current tightened measures. just days before a total lockdown kicked in on tuesday, massive traffic jams were seen at highways and there were hordes of panicked shoppers at supermarkets, sparking the hashtag #rakyatgagal, or ""citizens fail"", on twitter. ""where are you headed this weekend? mass movement is still happening despite interstate and inter-district travel restrictions,"" health director-general noor hisham abdullah said in a facebook post on saturday, sharing photos of traffic at highway toll plazas. twitter user itsfikaa wrote: ""this is not #kerajaangagal (failed government) anymore.  this is also #rakyatgagal.  the rising cases are mostly from cluster aidilfitri.  don't you get it? this is a total human failure.  you blamed the government but why did the aidilfitri cluster increase day by day?""according to senior minister for security ismail sabri yaakob, 200,000 people faked their way through police roadblocks to return to their home towns for hari raya, using fabricated ""emergencies"" to get police letters or misusing work letters. ""as a result, after hari raya, there were many clusters and also deaths,"" he said at a joint press conference with tan sri dr noor hisham on sunday. despite regular reminders sent by the authorities to malaysians on their phones that they should stay at home, wear their masks when out and wash their hands often, many are not paying attention. a viral video that stunned netizens last month showed an elderly man who had tested positive for covid-19 being kissed and hugged by family members before he was taken away by ambulance with medical workers wearing full protective gear. the chinese-language china press daily later reported that the man's son and other family members were also positive and under home quarantine. on monday, three nurses were fined rm4,000 (s$1,290) each after a social media post revealed that they had visited a friend who was under home quarantine as a close contact of a covid-19 patient. reports have also emerged that more than 52,000 people nationwide have missed their vaccination appointments. tan sri dr noor hisham tweeted last saturday that he expects the number of daily cases to surge to 13,000 by mid-june, and that it may take three to four months to flatten the curve, through a combination of public health measures and increasing vaccination rates. a doctor at a government hospital near kuala lumpur, who declined to be named, predicted a peak within the next two months. ""the actual numbers are likely to be more than those reported.  we are seeing daily admissions to our hospital, and our intensive care unit is also half full with covid-19 patients.  it is going to peak in june to july,"" the doctor said. newer, more infectious variants of the virus, coupled with the failure to follow the rules of prevention, are also responsible for the rise in numbers, said the government's covid-19 epidemiological analysis and strategies task force chairman, professor awang bulgiba awang mahmud. ""even if this lockdown is really strict, it would still require two to three months to bring the numbers down to a manageable level.  i suspect that the newer variants have an infectious period longer than two weeks, possibly as long as 21 days.  the question is whether the authorities will allow a lockdown long enough to see a real effect,"" he told the straits times. meanwhile, some are putting down the disregard for rules to ignorance. science teacher stephan ong, 45, said: ""i'm appalled at how poor the general population is when it comes to understanding basic science.  the fact that we have to explain to people how to wash their hands properly and with soap, how to wear a mask properly, and how vaccines work, is a sign that we need to give more focus on the sciences in our education system, for the good of the next generation.

2021-06-02,Your Wednesday Briefing.,"advertisementsupported byw. h. o.  approval for a second chinese vaccine. by melina delkicwe're covering w. h. o.  approval for another chinese vaccine, and reactions in the israeli media to the possible end of the netanyahu era. the world health organization cleared a covid-19 vaccine made by the chinese drugmaker sinovac biotech for emergency use.  the clearance means that the vaccine could be distributed as part of covax, the global effort to share shots with hard-hit, undersupplied nations. the decision came a month after the w. h. o. 's approval of another vaccine developed in china, by the state-backed sinopharm. the second vaccine, known as coronavac, has already been approved for use in 29 countries, including brazil and mexico.  the w. h. o.  had recently sought more safety and manufacturing data on coronavac, the wall street journal reported. efficacy data: clinical trials of coronavac in brazil and turkey delivered very different results, but both showed that it protected against covid-19.  on monday, brazil announced that a study in which an entire town received coronavac found that deaths from covid-19 there had dropped 95 percent. here are the latest updates and maps of the pandemic. in other developments:germany, greece and five other european countries began issuing a digital covid certificate for travel — recording whether users are vaccinated, have tested negative within 72 hours or have recovered from the virus. australia's national women's softball team arrived in japan ahead of the tokyo olympics, one of the first international competitors to arrive. the coronavirus has now claimed the lives of 32 lawmakers in the democratic republic of congo — more than 5 percent of its parliament. china's state news media trumpeted the government's announcement that it would allow couples to have three children as a positive change.  but across much of the country, the reaction was indignation. women worried that the move would only exacerbate discrimination from employers.  young people, who have barely been able to afford homes and necessities for themselves, were fuming.  working-class couples said it would be impossible. on weibo, users complained of mounting education expenses, sky-high housing prices and unforgiving work hours, and pointed out a shortage of child care options.  many people have to rely on their parents to help with their kids.  some millennials are choosing a kid-free lifestyle, and many men are having vasectomies to ensure they remain childless. quotable: one commenter on an article on the policy change said: ""get out of here! will you help us take care of the kids? will you give us a house?""related: china has nearly quintupled the acreage of public green space in its cities over the past 20 years to satisfy the demands for parks and better quality of life from a more affluent and educated populace. after more than 12 consecutive years at the helm of israel's government, prime minister benjamin netanyahu's hold on power may be coming to a close.  naftali bennett, an ultranationalist power broker, said he would cooperate with opposition leaders to form a coalition to replace netanyahu. israeli newspapers from across the political spectrum offered reactions that were as fractured as the electorate.  liberal columnists said netanyahu and his allies would make things harder for the new government; conservative pundits expressed dismay at the coalition; and ultra-orthodox writers warned of an ""anti-jewish"" government. quotable: ""if this were a hollywood movie, now would be the part in which someone would quietly walk into the room, lay a heavy hand on the speaker's shoulder, and say to him: 'sir, it's over.  no one believes a single word you're saying.  you've made your bed.  now you need to lie in it,'"" wrote ben caspit, a columnist for maariv and a vocal critic of netanyahu. authorities in sri lanka opened an investigation into the crew of a cargo ship laden with toxic chemicals that has burned off the nation's coast for 12 days, spilling debris into the ocean. the biden administration on tuesday said it will suspend oil drilling leases in the arctic national wildlife refuge that were issued in the waning days of the trump presidency. a clothing shop assistant in seoul followed a belgian ambassador's wife out of the store, stopped her in the street and checked the label of her jacket to make sure it had not been shoplifted.  the woman slapped the shop assistant.  it has turned into a diplomatic brouhaha. the pope broadened the catholic church's definition of sexual abuse to explicitly acknowledge that adults, and not only children, can be victimized by priests. president biden will meet with surviving members of the 1921 massacre in tulsa, okla. , when angry whites descended on a prosperous african-american part of the city, killing as many as 300 people and destroying more than 1,250 homes. giovanni brusca, an italian mobster who admitted to involvement in more than 100 killings before becoming an informer, has been released after serving 25 years in prison. a morning readnaomi osaka dropped out of the french open after organizers fined her for failing to turn up at a news conference.  osaka cited mental health reasons for her refusal to talk to the media.  one of the takeaways from the whole affair may be that some players really do find it all too much to bear.  our sports reporter looked at what went wrong, what we know and what we don't know. the globe theater of shakespeare's day survived multiple outbreaks of the plague.  so when the pandemic shuttered live performances in london last march, many expected the modern recreation of the globe to make it through.  it hasn't been easy. the theater, which relies heavily on tourism, let go of 180 freelance actors and crew, and furloughed most permanent staff members.  even with those cuts, executives said, the globe might have shut down if not for the british government's arts bailout. the globe reopened last month at a quarter of its usual capacity.  to cut down on costs, it's staging a revival of a 2019 production of ""a midsummer night's dream. "" actors must maintain social distancing onstage, and plays are running without an intermission to reduce virus risk. the times culture reporter alex marshall recently headed to the globe for its first performance in over a year.  the mood outside, he reported, was ecstatic.  ""it's just great we're back and people are hungry for it,"" sean holmes, the play's director, said.  ""we can't sustain at this level of audience by any means, but i'm feeling optimistic. ""what to cookmake a quick, elegant dinner of roasted fish with cherry tomatoes. what to watchthe fifth and final season of ""kim's convenience,"" the canadian sitcom that explores korean food culture

2021-06-02,Tennis: Sympathy for Osaka in Japan over French Open withdrawal.,"tokyo: japanese fans and public figures rallied in support of tennis star naomi osaka on tuesday (jun 1), offering sympathy after she withdrew from the french open and opened up about her battles with depression. the four-time grand slam winner's career is followed closely in japan and the controversy in paris, which followed her refusal to attend press conferences, led news bulletins on tuesday. reaction in japan was largely sympathetic, with one twitter user urging osaka to ""take a good, long break"". ""i hope she gets to eat what she wants, watch what she wants and listen to what she wants.  i hope she wraps herself up in a fluffy blanket and takes it easy until she feels content. ""osaka revealed that she has ""suffered long bouts of depression"" after pulling out of the french open on monday, and will ""take some time away from the court"". her withdrawal follows the fall-out from her decision to boycott press conferences at the tournament, which she said were like ""kicking people when they are down"". osaka is expected to represent japan at the tokyo olympics, and will be one of the host country's highest-profile athletes at the games if she takes part. but japanese fans urged her to take care of herself first and foremost.

""there's a big difference between people's personalities, and i think we need to consider things on a case-by-case basis,"" said sugiyama, who reached a career-high number eight world ranking.

2021-06-02,A burning ship covered beautiful beaches in plastic ‘snow.’ Now Sri Lanka faces an environmental disaster.,"sri lanka is facing one of the worst environmental crises in its history as tons of potentially toxic debris from a fire aboard a container ship blanket miles of its western coastline. the south asian country's military said it had subdued the blaze aboard the mv x-press pearl over the weekend, after more than a week of raging flames and billowing black smoke.  but officials and scientists warn that the maritime disaster is far from over, with billions of plastic pellets washing up on beaches up to 75 miles to the south. as sri lankan sailors scrape the debris from beaches and the ship smolders, scientists are trying to determine how far the flotsam will travel and what the damage will be. ""it's an environmental disaster,"" sri lankan marine biologist asha de vos told the washington post.  she said she worries currents could eventually carry the plastic pellets as far as the other side of the island nation, killing wildlife and damaging sensitive ecosystems. the crew of the x-press pearl first spotted smoke rising from the cargo hold on may 20 while anchored not far from the port of colombo, according to x-press feeders, the company that operates the singapore-flagged ship.  they tried to extinguish the fire by releasing carbon dioxide in the hold, but the fire grew and an explosion rocked the recently built ship on may 22, the company said. the 25-person crew was evacuated as the sri lankan navy tried to suppress the blaze, with help from the indian coast guard and firefighting tugs belonging to a dutch company. infrared footage of the ship taken over the weekend  showed the fires had almost gone out. sri lankan authorities suspect the fire was caused by a leak from the ship's containers, which were carrying 25 metric tons of nitric acid.  (the chemical is used in fertilizers as well as explosives. )in an interview with shipping industry publication splash, x-press feeders executive chairman tim hartnoll said poor packaging was responsible for the leak, which the crew had detected while in the arabian sea. according to an x-press feeders statement, the ship applied to the western indian port of hazira and the qatari port of hamad to offload the leaking container, but the requests were denied.  ""the advice given was there were no specialist facilities or expertise immediately available to deal with the leaking acid,"" the company said. ""it was a case of not in my backyard syndrome,"" hartnoll told splash. sri lankan officials said monday a special police team had begun investigating as the government seeks to take legal action against the vessel's owners over the incident, the associated press reported. the ship was also carrying 78 metric tons of plastic pellets, or nurdles, according to mongabay, an environmental news organization.  some of them poured into the ocean and began washing up on the coastline. yellow-sand beaches normally popular with sri lankan and foreign tourists quickly became covered in the tiny granules. ""it was nuts,"" said de vos, who is also executive director of the marine conservation and education organization oceanswell.  ""it was basically [plastic] snow on our beaches, these tiny white pellets, and piles of them. ""the government banned fishing along around 50 miles of coast, a significant blow for a country where the industry makes up about 2 percent of its economy.  dead fish have begun washing up on beaches. authorities have warned people not to touch the debris from the ship because it could be contaminated with harmful chemicals.  beaches known for their crabs are now crawling with thousands of members of the military in protective suits. adding to the pain is a national lockdown restricting movement in the country, said muditha katuwawala of pearl protectors, another sri lankan marine conservation organization. ""it has been difficult to mobilize any volunteers,"" he said, adding that the spill was ""by far the worst marine environmental disaster in our region. ""it could take a long time to understand the full impact of the disaster.  for example, plastic mixed into the sand could raise the temperature of beaches where sea turtles lay their eggs, leading to all-male or all-female broods, de vos said.  the plastic ""will be in our beaches for a long time to come. ""as she and other scientists track where the pellets end up, de vos hopes the shocking images raise awareness about the impact of more everyday pollution.

2021-06-02,"Protection from Harassment Court to be established on Jun 1 to make it easier, faster for victims to obtain relief.","singapore: singapore will establish the protection from harassment court on jun 1, which will allow for easier and faster processing of relief for harassment victims, according to a joint release issued by the ministry of law and the state courts on monday (may 31). the new specialised court will hear all criminal and civil matters under the protection from harassment act (poha) and will adopt a simplified process for certain types of applications, including those for protection orders and orders relating to falsehoods. under the simplified track, a claimant can file a claim online and at lower cost through the state courts'community justice and tribunals systemthat is accessible 24/7. this is as opposed to the current process, which requires travelling to filing bureaus to file an originating summons with a supporting affidavit in-person, said the authorities. the system also offers a pre-filing assessment for people to assess the validity of their claims. claims that can be made under the simplified track must involve only one claimant and no more than five respondents, be brought within two years from the date that the course of action is accrued, and not include a claim for damages above s$20,000. hearings will also be conducted more quickly under the new court, which will target to conduct hearings for expedited protection orders within 48 to 72 hours of the application. this target is reduced to within 24 hours where there is a ""risk of violence or actual violence"", said the authorities. the court will aim to hear protection orders within four weeks of the application. respondents can also initiate an ""enegotiation"" process on the system to try and reach an amicable settlement with a claimant, said the authorities. cases in the protection from harassment court may be transferred to other courts, and vice versa. ""this transfer mechanism recognises how harassment may occur against the backdrop of other ongoing proceedings, such as divorce proceedings,"" said the authorities. from jun 1, cases may be transferred between the protection from harassment court and district court or magistrate's court.  transfers with the family court will be operationalised at a later date. enhanced protectionseveral changes to enhance protection for victims of harassment will also come into effect on jun 1. firstly, victims will face fewer hurdles to obtain protection orders.  if a respondent has been convicted of any poha or hurt-related offence against the victim, the requirement to show that a poha provision has been contravened – which is necessary before a protection order can be granted – will be ""deemed satisfied"". ""victims will not have to relive their experience more than necessary, to obtain protection,"" said the authorities. secondly, judges granting expedited protection orders will be required to consider whether a criminal investigation is warranted, and if so, to refer cases to the police for investigation. people who have breached protection orders or expedited protection orders can also be arrested in prescribed scenarios, such as where hurt is caused. these changes are being introduced because in egregious cases of hurt or harassment, it may not be enough to grant the victim a civil remedy, said the authorities. thirdly, protection orders and expedited protection orders will be further extended to protect people related to the victim, as they may also be harassed by the same perpetrator. it will also be made clear that domestic exclusion orders – which restrain the perpetrator from entering the victim's residence or parts of the residence – can be granted as part of a protection order. this will ensure better protection for victims who may stay in the same residence as the harasser, said the authorities. the establishment of the protection from harassment court and the other amendments are provided for under the protection from harassment (amendment) bill 2019 passed by parliament in may 2019. minister for law k shanmugam said at the time the changes to the law were a ""crucial step"". ""the message is clear: it is unacceptable for perpetrators, the penalties are increased, toughened, the legal framework is even stricter, so even if it's a civil order, protection order, if you breach it, the police will come after you.  it's an absolute no-no, not acceptable,"" mr shanmugam had said. ""for the victims, it's both that the law will protect you . . .  but also that we have to increase awareness, we have to make them understand that they don't need to be in such relationships, that they can walk out, that there is a system that will protect them.

""the risk of large-scale spread is extremely low,"" the nhc said, adding that the man was in a stable condition and his close contacts had reported no ""abnormalities"".  it described h10n3 as low pathogenic less likely to cause death or severe illness in birds. the man was stable and ready to be discharged from hospital.  medical observation of his close contacts had not found any other cases. the nhc said there had been no human cases of h10n3 previously reported in the world. h10n3 is a low pathogenic, or relatively less severe, strain of the virus in poultry and the risk of it spreading on a large scale was very low, the nhc added. the strain is ""not a very common virus"", said filip claes, regional laboratory coordinator of the food and agriculture organisation's emergency centre for transboundary animal diseases at the regional office for asia and the pacific. only around 160 isolates of the virus were reported in the 40 years to 2018, mostly in wild birds or waterfowl in asia and some limited parts of north america, and none had been detected in chickens so far, he added. analysing the genetic data of the virus will be necessary to determine whether it resembles older viruses or if it is a novel mix of different viruses, claes said. several strains of bird flu have been found among animals in china but mass outbreaks in humans are rare. the last human epidemic of bird flu in china occurred in late 2016 to 2017, with the h7n9 virus. the h7n9 has infected 1,668 people and claimed 616 lives since 2013, according to the united nations' food and agriculture organisation. following recent avian flu outbreaks in africa and eurasia, the head of china's centre for disease control and prevention last week urged stricter surveillance in poultry farms, markets and wild birds. covid-19 was first detected at a food and animal market in the central chinese city of wuhan in late 2019. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-06-02,"Doctor suspended for 5 months for trying to sell erectile dysfunction drug to non-patient, Health News & Top Stories.","read 3 articles daily and stand to win st rewards, including the st news tablet worth $398. spin the wheel for st read and win now. singapore a doctor has been suspended for five months for trying to sell an erectile dysfunction drug to a man who was not his patient. although the man did not end up buying the drug, which is regulated, the singapore medical council (smc) felt that dr ho tze woon's two attempts at providing it were conduct that ""fell short of that expected of medical practitioners"". the disciplinary tribunal also took into account a third charge, which was not proceeded on.  this relates to his downloading of ""pornographic or obscene materials onto the computers of six consultation rooms at the choa chu kang polyclinic where he worked"" between october 2014 and july 2016. the doctor pleaded guilty to the charges but said in mitigation that he had not sold the drug, which was also not addictive, unlike medication containing codeine. the smc received a complaint from the police on the attempted sale of the drug.  it is not stated how the police had found out. the tribunal said in its published grounds of decision that this was likely the first time such a case has come up in a disciplinary hearing.  this case was of ""a doctor attempting to sell a regulated medicine/drug, ostensibly obtained in a proper manner originally for his own medical condition, to someone who is not a patient,"" it said. the first transaction failed because the man had refused to accept the drug, cialis, as the packaging was damaged.  the deal fell through a second time after they could not agree on the price. while the tribunal agreed that no actual harm was caused, as the sale did not materialise, the incident does affect public confidence in the profession. ""doctors are able to dispense medicines and drugs in the poisons act without a licence from the proper authority because that is a privilege granted to doctors who are treating patients under their care,"" it said. ""this trust in the medical profession would be impacted because of the callous way dr ho disregarded the medical ethics guidelines and rules. ""although dr ho said he was only trying to help the man get the drug more cheaply, the tribunal said ""it does not appear that dr ho was entirely altruistic about his intentions"", based on the text messages between the two men. dr ho had quoted $203 for a box of 28 pills, including goods and services tax (gst), followed by an exchange of text messages on oct 23, 2017, with the man (mr c). mr c: btw, why r u charging gst?dr ho: not me, its suppliermr c: supplier? i'm not even getting a receipt!mr c: like this it's not much diff from buying from clinic!dr ho: ok 190 is ok.  u coming or not?mr c: otw.  $180?the tribunal concluded that dr ho's intent to supply cialis to the man for a price could not be clearer and more palpable.  that the sale did not take place is irrelevant, it said. the tribunal's verdict, published on tuesday (june 1) on the smc website, was to impose a five-month suspension and a $2,000 fine.  dr ho was also censured and has to pay the cost of the proceedings. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-06-02,An F&B in turmoil — S'pore chefs share how they're coping with the dining-in ban.,"singapore — ""zat, do you know why f&b workers are not given priority for covid-19 vaccination?"" chef dylan ong asks over direct chat on instagram the week when phase 2 (heightened alert) started. his question came amidst a press conference where the newly-minted minister for health, ong ye kung, announced a new vaccination strategy that extends the time between doses so that the maximum number of people can be protected.  students between the ages of 12-15 will also be eligible for the pfizer biontech vaccination. phase 2 (ha) was announced due to the rising number of unlinked covid-19 cases and the emergence of clusters in singapore with his round of tightened measures spanning 16 may to 13 june 2021.  some of the limitations enforced by phase 2 (ha) are reduced social gathering size to two people (down from five) and reenacting working from home as a default. dining-in would also no longer be allowed at all f&b outlets across the island, including at hawker centres, coffee shops, and food courts. for some of the chefs and restaurant owners, i spoke to, this outright ban on dining-in left them blindsided and reminded them a lot of what happened in april last year when singapore enacted circuit breaker measures for three months. ""i was surprised because i thought any new wave would have been mitigated by our collective efforts of mask-wearing, social-distancing, and the usage of contact tracing apps,"" willin low, chef and founder of wild rocket, shared with me over whatsapp.  ""also, don't we have very stringent border controls that include swab tests and strict quarantine measures?""chef dylan was running lunch service at his restaurant, the masses, when he heard of the announcement on friday, 14 may.  ""it was too short a notice for something this drastic to happen by sunday.  for restaurants, saturday will definitely be a full house, especially when it's the last day of dining-in before phase 2 (ha) kicks in.  how do i find time to pivot to full delivery service over one day?""""yes, i know we have done this before,"" dylan went on to say.  ""but it would have been so much better had the government given us an earlier heads up.  i know it's a critical situation that requires decisive decision making.  i expected the government to be more sensible than to dole out this knee-jerk reaction. ""the question of priority vaccination for f&b workersto be completely honest, i've never questioned why people working in the f&b industries weren't given priority for vaccination—at least not until dylan asked.  his concerns, though, were understandable. in phase 3 that commenced on 28 dec 2020, dining in a group of up to 8 people was permitted.  up until the announcement of phase 2 (ha), eating at restaurants remained the only close contact group activity where masks can be taken off during the entire meal duration—presenting a higher possibility for the virus to spread if safe distancing measures and sanitisation procedures weren't properly adhered. the perilous state of dining-in was further exacerbated by recent reports that the kopitiam food court at changi airport terminal 3 was visited by several confirmed cases, some of which have already been vaccinated.  changi airport would eventually be named as one of the largest active clusters in phase 3, swelling to more than 100 people. ""a thousand things went through my mind when the ban on dining-in was announced.  but my foremost worry was the safety of my staff, especially since this new b16172 variant is said to be more infectious than the last,"" said chef johanne siy of lolla at amoy street. ""my greatest concern was both the drop in sales and the increased number of cases that might put my colleagues at risk,"" dominic tan, founder of ajumma's, shared.  ""the daily rise in cases also doesn't assure us that the restrictions will last for only one month. ""minister lawrence wong, co-chair of the covid-19 multi-ministry task force, has since remarked that the current phase 2 (ha) measures are working and that no further tightening is expected. concerns over employabilityearly this year, phase 3 measures brought some much-needed relief for f&b establishments affected by circuit breaker measures.  some chef-owners i spoke to last month in march even lamented the lack of staff to handle the onslaught of reservations from diners—customers with money to spare and nowhere to spend it except locally through staycations and to dine out at restaurants. this aura of upbeat positivity has drastically taken a tumble, even if only based on anecdotes.  while circuit breaker seems more a test of inventiveness and how pivot-ready f&b businesses are, phase 2 (ha) is shaping up to be solely about survivability. ""i guess in a way, we are more prepared today than previously as we have at least experienced it once and know what to expect,"" said chef willin.  ""the main challenge now is how to ensure all my colleagues, and i keep our jobs. ""it's a concern shared by the co-founder of apollo coffee bar, shirlynn eng.  ""to us, the team is family, and despite the circumstances, our priority is to make sure that our employees will be taken care of.  many of our crew have families both in singapore and internationally—these countries include malaysia, vietnam, and the philippines. """"so our priority is clear.  to do whatever it takes to support and sustain their livelihood. ""concerns over long-term financial stabilitychef dylan readily admits that, like many other chefs, he's now more operationally prepared for delivery and takeaway services even with a tight runway of one day. but at its core, he posits that the problems and issues remain the same.  f&b owners tend to run with a tight financial capital—any form of disruption in dining-in revenue will most certainly hit them hard. ""unfortunately, it's even harder now as we're unsure what financial support we can get from the government to tide us over.  will there be rental rebates for this one month also? none of us knows. ""although not immediately announced—and in some ways quite telling of how rushed these phase 2 (ha) measures are—rental relief for smes was recently introduced on 28 may 2021 by finance minister lawrence wong. under the rental support scheme, privately owned commercial properties can look forward to getting a half month rental relief cash payout directly from the inland revenue authority of singapore. ""from a business standpoint, i think it will be so much harder to survive this round,"" said chef johanne.  ""there's so much more competition from established players and new home-based businesses.  it seems idealistic, but i hope everyone can find a place in the sun and somehow find a way to survive.

""iko is only three weeks old, and i'm once again facing a ban on dining-in.  it's a new brand that has, unfortunately, come to a standstill after all that marketing effort we put out; it's heartbreaking. ""it's now evident that with every enactment and tightening of covid-19 measures, the industry where the effects are most keenly and immediately felt is in the f&b sector. according to the singapore department of statistics, f&b sales registered a year-on-year decline of 26% in 2020.  it was the worst-performing year since the growth rate was first recorded back in 1986, surpassing the asian financial crisis in 1998, sars in 2003, and the global financial crisis in 2009. in dollar terms, retail and f&b sales registered a decline of about s$4 billion during circuit breaker. could phase 2 (ha) measures be better mitigated?with such sobering statistics gleaned from circuit breaker last year, i wondered how the sudden ban on dining-in, and in retrospect, phase 2 (ha) measures could have been better mitigated, especially given that we have experience and prior knowledge on hand. for dominic, government mitigation and intervention could have been offered earlier, even before phase 2 (ha) measures were enacted. ""i feel that earlier support to manage crowds at f&b establishments could have been put in place, such as encouraging landlords to allow installation of clear perspex or acrylic sheets within the restaurants to create a safer dining environment for diners,"" said dominic. dylan, however, was less enthused about how the government went about handling the ban on dining-in. ""we have done this before.  why are we still so lacking in how we prepare the people of singapore for such drastic measures? government leaders were put in place so they can have better foresight than us ordinary citizens.  this kind of knee jerk reaction speaks volumes of the kind of leaders we have now. """"i'm just extremely disappointed with how this is being handled,"" dylan went on to add. in our initial interview, willin wondered if there could have been a more gradual easing in of restrictions by cutting down the number of diners allowed per group instead of implementing such a drastic and sudden outright ban. ""but in view of the 38 local transmissions today (16 may 2021), i guess what the government is doing regarding the ban on dining-in does not seem too out of line, given how infectious this new strain is,"" said willin a few hours after the number of new community cases was announced. when life gives you lemonswhile waiting for dining-in to resume, some restaurants are taking a 'when life gives you lemon' approach to the pivot rerun to delivery and takeaway. at birds of a feather, chef eugene see has put together food bundles featuring signature dishes from the restaurant and its four sister brands.  there's the ""french toast"" from halcyon & crane, ""salmon grain bowl"" from 51soho, ""king prawn noodles"" from chuan hung noodle stall and the signature ""find the chicken in the chillis"" from birds of a feather. ""by offering this bundle, we hope our customers can experience what we can offer for our food delivery at a group level, and at the same time, bring the best food items to their doorsteps,"" chef eugene shared. at shirlynn eng's five cafe concepts—apollo coffee bar, neptune cafe, columbus coffee co. , lunar coffee brewers, and atlas coffeehouse—diners can look forward to the 'choux box', a care package iteration inspired by the first circuit breaker.  then, shirlynn witnessed first-hand the rising practice of people gifting their friends or loved ones 'care packages'.  there's also an encouraging response to the care packages shirlynn rolled out at the time. as the end date for phase 2 (ha) on june 13 draws to a close, chefs and restaurant owners wait with breath that is bated for dining-in to resume and, for many of us ordinary citizens, for life to regain some semblance of normalcy—however that may look. undoubtedly, these are tough times for the f&b sector, made more challenging with razor-thin profit margins, disruptions in the supply of raw ingredients due to tightened border controls, and, funnily enough, a vibrant local dining scene with every operator eager for a slice of the proverbial pie. perhaps shirlynn puts it best.  ""we just want our friends, family, and customers to live a little amidst this tough time, love a lot, and laugh over these delightful treats.  it's perhaps exactly what we need these days to get through these four weeks—joy and spontaneity.

""the player will sign a contract until the end of the 2022-23 season and his buy out clause is set at 100 million euros. ""official: barcelona have confirmed the signing of sergio aguero 📝 pic. twitter. com/tdiaxfswt9barca took the decision to sell star striker luis suarez to atletico madrid last summer without signing a replacement, which left lionel messi shouldering the main goalscoring burden for the team in 2020-21. ronald koeman's men were able to achieve success in the copa del rey, but fell short in the champions league and la liga, with atletico ultimately clinching their first title since 2013-14 thanks to suarez's prolific form in the final third. barca will hope that aguero can have a similar impact next season, despite the fact that the argentine struggled for form and fitness during his final campaign at etihad stadium. aguero is set to link up with his international team-mate and close friend messi at camp nou, and they will be expected to strike up a strong partnership as the blaugrana aim to return to elite level on both domestic and european fronts. 💪🟦🟥 #kunculer pic. twitter.

their all-time record scorer in the process. aguero signed off in the premier league with a trademark double in a 5-0 thrashing of everton on the last day of the season, but suffered heartbreak in his

2021-06-02,IAEA highlights ‘complicated’ Iran ties as nuclear talks continue.,"tehran, iran – as nuclear talks to restore iran's 2015 nuclear deal appear likely to be extended, a report by the global nuclear watchdog has highlighted its complicated monitoring relationship with iran. in a report circulated on monday, the international atomic energy agency (iaea) said iran has failed to thoroughly explain traces of uranium found at several previously undeclared sites. ""after many months, iran has not provided the necessary explanation for the presence of the nuclear material particles at any of the three locations where the agency has conducted complementary accesses [inspections],"" the iaea told member states. the united kingdom, france and germany, the three european powers party to iran's nuclear deal, tried to censure iran at the iaea board of governors – with backing from the united states – earlier this year but dropped their plan after iran agreed to cooperate with international experts. another board meeting is due later this month, but pursuing a similar plan by the european powers could directly endanger ongoing talks in vienna to restore the joint comprehensive plan of action (jcpoa), as the nuclear deal is formally known. iran's nuclear chief ali akbar salehi wrote a letter to iaea director general rafael grossi after the latest agency report was published. according to iran's vienna envoy kazem gharibabadi, he pointed out in the letter that iran recently agreed to keep recording its nuclear facilities for another month in order to continue technical negotiations with the agency. ""on safeguards, iran has so far done its utmost efforts to cooperate with the agency substantively and provide the necessary clarifications and responses,"" gharibabadi tweeted, adding iran will continue to cooperate. in response, russia's top negotiator in vienna, mikhail ulyanov, said the relationship between iran and the iaea is ""complicated"" at the moment but ""we have reasons to believe that the current difficulties are temporary of character"". this is while a fifth round of talks in vienna to lift us sanctions on iran and bring it back to full compliance with the jcpoa may not be the last as delegates hoped. iran's top negotiator, deputy foreign minister abbas araghchi, said on monday he believes the delegates may need to go back to their capitals one more time to consult. ""we have reached the main issues of dispute.  we're at a point where we're only dealing with the obvious differences and much of the required texts have been drafted,"" he said. former us president donald trump unilaterally abandoned the nuclear deal in may 2018, levelling relentless waves of sanctions as part of his administration's ""maximum pressure"" campaign on iran. efforts to restore the deal continue as iran heads for its june 18 election, in which conservative judiciary chief ebrahim raisi is the frontrunner. the iaea report on monday also provided the first detailed insight into the ramifications of sabotage at iran's main nuclear facilities in natanz – one of several over the past year – which the country blamed on israel. the agency said iran's total stockpile of enriched uranium of various grades increased by an estimated 273kg (600 pounds) in the three months ending may 22, just over half the 525kg increase in the previous quarter. the power blackout at natanz happened mid-way in that period, on april 11. iran started enriching uranium up to a purity of more than 60 percent following the incident, its highest yet, prompting iaea's grossi to call it ""very concerning"" last month.  iran's stockpile of 60-percent enriched uranium now stands at just 2. 4kg, according to the watchdog. but the iaea also said iran's total stockpile is now estimated to be about 3,241kg, about 16 times higher than the permitted stockpile under the jcpoa, which also capped enrichment at 3. 67 percent. a fifth round of dialogue to revive the 2015 iran nuclear deal is under way in vienna. the one-month extension gives negotiators in vienna time to revive the nuclear deal from which the us withdrew in 2018. as us and iran try to revive nuclear deal, experts warn about iaea safeguards governing the frequency of inspections. follow al jazeera

2021-06-02,Vatican laws changed to toughen sexual abuse punishment.,"pope francis has changed the roman catholic church's laws to explicitly criminalise sexual abuse. it is the biggest overhaul of the criminal code for nearly 40 years. the new rules make sexual abuse, grooming minors for sex, possessing child pornography and covering up abuse a criminal offence under vatican law. the pope said one aim was to ""reduce the number of cases in which the. . .  penalty was left to the discretion of authorities"". the changes to the code of canon law took 11 years to develop and included input from canonist and criminal law experts.  the catholic church has been rocked in recent years by thousands of reports of historic sexual abuse by priests, and cover-ups by senior clergy, around the world.  victims and critics had complained for decades that the previous laws were outdated, designed to protect perpetrators and were open to interpretation.  the new code replaces the last major changes made by pope john paul ii in 1983.  it is designed to have clearer and more specific language, and dictates that bishops must take action when a complaint is made. the new rules come into effect on 8 december.  they also prohibit the ordination of women, recording confessions and committing fraud. the vatican's law also now recognises that adults as well as children can be victimised by priests who abuse their authority.  previously, the church believed adults could give or withdraw consent because of their age, and did not take into account that adults could also be victims, especially if there is a power imbalance. the code says a priest can lose their position if they used ""force, threats or abuse of his authority"" to engage in sexual acts. for the first time, laypeople working within the church system, such as administrators, can also face punishment for abuse, such as losing their jobs, paying fines or being removed from their communities.  the new rules criminalise ""grooming"" of minors or vulnerable adults to pressure them to take part in pornography.  it is the first time the church has officially recognised grooming as a method used by sexual predators to exploit and abuse victims. the law has also taken away the discretionary power that had previously allowed high-ranking church officials to ignore or cover up allegations of abuse to protect priests.  now, anyone found guilty of this could be charged with negligence in failing to properly investigate and punish sexual predators. monsignor filippo iannone, who leads the vatican department that oversaw the changes, said there had been ""a climate of excessive slack in the interpretation of penal law"", where mercy was sometimes put before justice. the changes come under the new heading of ""offences against human life, dignity and liberty,"" which replaces the previously vague ""crimes against special obligations"".  the new laws do not spell out sexual offences against minors, but instead still refer to offences against the sixth commandment, which prohibits adultery. advocates have long demanded the church remove the reference to the sixth commandment, and define the abuse as a crime against children instead of a violation of priestly celibacy. ""describing child sexual abuse as the canonical crime of 'adultery' is wrong and minimises the criminal nature of abuse inflicted on child victims.  a canonical crime relating to child sexual abuse should be clearly identified as a crime against the child,"" said a 2020 report into child sexual abuse, sponsored by the uk government. pope francis has worked to tackle sexual abuse allegations involving catholic priests since he became pontiff in 2013.  he led a landmark summit on clerical sex abuse in 2019, and lifted the controversial rule of ""pontifical secrecy"" in a bid to improve transparency. the church previously shrouded sexual abuse cases in secrecy, in what it said was an effort to protect the privacy of victims and reputations of the accused.  critics said some church officials abused the rule to avoid co-operation with police in abuse cases. roman catholic church admits abusechildren tell of neglect, filth and fear in us campschina's sinovac covid vaccine gets who approvalit is the second chinese vaccine to get the green light from the global health body. world's largest meat supplier hit by cyber-attackbiden to suspend trump arctic drilling leasesthe villagers caught between sparring asian giantsnew china child policy sparks tales of 'trauma'two children, a decade of war.  videotwo children, a decade of warthe rise and fall of a drug kingpinâs wifethe legacyâ of theâ murder of james byrd jr.  videothe legacyâ of theâ murder of james byrd jrthe indian children orphaned by covid-19south korea: from food wasters to recyclers.  videosouth korea: from food wasters to recyclerspregnant, unprotected and living in fear of covidabducted activist points finger at pakistan securitylyrics quizhave you been getting these songs wrong?feeling hotwhat happens to your body in extreme heat?world's largest meat supplier hit by cyber-attack1china's sinovac covid vaccine gets who approval2belarus activist 'stabs his neck' in court3the rise and fall of a drug kingpinâs wife4biden first president to mark tulsa race massacre5zero daily covid deaths announced in uk6infamous sicilian mafia boss released from prison7brazil defends hosting of copa america tournament8huawei operating system coming to asia smartphones9what happened when a whole town got covid jabs?10â© 2021 bbc.  the bbc is not responsible for the content of external sites.  read about our approach to external linking.

dbs, southeast asia's largest bank, has launched its first security token offering (sto) on its cryptocurrency exchange.  the dbs digital bond is priced at 15 million singapore dollars.  ""we expect asset tokenization to increasingly become more mainstream,"" said a dbs executive. dbs announced monday its first security token offering (sto) on the dbs digital exchange (ddex).  the dbs digital bond, priced at 15 million singapore dollars (us$11. 37 million), comes with a six-month tenor and coupon rate of 0. 60% per annum.  it is offered as a private placement and dbs is the sole bookrunner for the transaction.  the bank detailed:this paves the way for other issuers and clients to tap on ddex's capabilities to efficiently access capital markets for their funding needs and sets the stage for more sto issuances and listings on ddex as asset tokenisation turns mainstream. clifford lee, global head of fixed income at dbs, said that ""this marks the first of many steps in the journey to evolve the traditional bond issuance into a broader digital ecosystem where more inclusive issuer and investor participation can be rapidly developed. ""lee continued: ""while most bond tokenization exercises announced in asia to date tend to be repackaged forms of a conventional bond issue, the current transaction directly combines existing legal and tax infrastructure requirements with a direct issuance on the digital exchange in smaller lot sizes. "" the executive added:this bond token structure was only made possible because of the progressive development of singapore's legal and tax infrastructure, which can facilitate more sto issuances to broaden and deepen our capital markets.        eng-kwok seat moey, group head of capital markets at dbs, commented: ""our maiden sto listing on the dbs digital exchange is a significant milestone . . .  this cements our ability to provide integrated solutions across the digital asset value chain, from deal origination to tokenization, listing, trading, and custody, which in turn opens the door for more stos on ddex. "" he emphasized:we expect asset tokenisation to increasingly become more mainstream as more of our clients start to embrace security token issuance as part of their capital fund raising exercise which we believe will boost singapore's ambitions to be a digital asset hub in asia. the dbs digital exchange was launched in december last year.  it offers ""exchange services between four fiat currencies (sgd, usd, hkd, jpy)"" and four ""cryptocurrencies, namely bitcoin, ether, bitcoin cash, and xrp,"" its website explains. the bank disclosed in its first-quarter earnings call that its crypto exchange ""enjoyed strong market traction since its launch.

2021-06-02,Hong Kong prosecutors seek up to life in prison for 'subversive' activists.,"kalvin ho, one of the 47 pro-democracy activists charged under the national security law for participating in an unofficial primary election last year, was denied bail in march/afpdozens of leading hong kong democracy activists could face up to life in prison for organising an unofficial primary election, prosecutors confirmed monday, in the most sweeping use yet of beijing's strict new security law. police charged the 47 activists with ""subversion"" after they organised a non-binding vote last year to choose candidates for an ultimately postponed local election. the defendants say they were simply taking part in opposition politics. but authorities accused them of a ""vicious plot"" to subvert the government by seeking a majority in the city's partially-elected legislature. on monday the defendants appeared en masse for the first time in nearly three months at a hearing in which a judge granted a request by prosecutors to have the case upgraded to the city's high court. offences heard in that court start at seven years imprisonment for those who are convicted.  the maximum penalty under the new security law is life in prison. beijing has moved to quash dissent in the semi-autonomous city after huge and sometimes violent pro-democracy demonstrations in 2019. the security law criminalises anything authorities deem to be subversion, secession, terrorism or collusion with foreign forces. police and prosecutors have since applied the law broadly with the vast majority of those charged for political speech. under the new law — which beijing imposed directly on the city last june — defendants may only be granted bail if they can persuade a court they no longer pose any kind of national security risk. that clause has removed hong kong's common law tradition that maintains a presumption of bail for non-violent crimes. monday's proceedings were the first time the public was able to see most of the defendants since early march when the vast majority — 36 — were denied bail at a mammoth hearing. that hearing dragged on for so many days that some of those in the dock collapsed from exhaustion. bail decisions published since that hearing have revealed that judges are deciding whether some of those in custody still pose a potential security risk. claudia mo, a former lawmaker, was denied bail partly because of whatsapp messages with foreign journalists in which she commented on news and political events. another former lawmaker jeremy tam saw his

may 31, 2021 @ 10:49 am by omar faridi singapore-based dbs bank ltd (sgx:d05), a multinational banking and financial services corporation with over $330 billion in assets, revealed on monday (may 31, 2021) that it has priced a sgd 15 million (appr.  $11. 35 million) digital bond, which marks dbs digital exchange's (ddex) first security token offering as part of its efforts to provide a wide range of products. the dbs digital bond, which has come with a six-month tenor and coupon rate of 0. 60% per annum, was carried out through a private placement.  dbs is reportedly the sole bookrunner for the transaction. this transaction should help pave the way for other issuers and clients to leverage ddex's capabilities to gain access to capital markets for their funding requirements.  it may also lead to more security token issuances and listings on ddex as asset tokenization becomes more widely-adopted. eng-kwok seat moey, group head of capital markets at dbs, said that digitalization through the issuance of security tokens offers a great opportunity for corporates looking for alternative platforms like ddex to raise capital from apac region's fast-evolving private capital markets. at present, the asia-pacific region accounts for almost one-third or over 30% of the international private equity market, which reached a record $4. 73 trillion last year. in order to encourage more participation from investors, the digital bond will reportedly be traded in board lots of sgd 10,000 (appr.  $7,560). this is a considerably smaller denomination when compared to traditional wholesale bonds, which usually require investment and trading amounts that can be multiples of sgd 250,000. with this new listing of the digital bonds on ddex, the securities will be available for secondary trading to institutional and accredited investors who may be members or clients of ddex. introduced in december of last year, ddex is part of an integrated crypto-asset ecosystem that utilizes blockchain or distributed ledger tech (dlt) to offer a secure and transparent platform to raise capital via the private market. dbs stated that the ddex has seen strong market traction since it went live last year.  daily trading volumes have surged by as much as 10x from when the platform was first launched.  the exchange is now serving more than 120 participants.  dbs also holds more than sgd 80 million in crypto-assets in its custody services. eng-kwok seat moey stated:""our maiden sto listing on the dbs digital exchange is a significant milestone, as it highlights the strength of our digital asset ecosystem in facilitating new ways of unlocking value for issuers and investors.  we expect asset tokenisation to increasingly become more mainstream as more of our clients start to embrace security token issuance as part of their capital fund raising exercise which we believe will boost singapore's ambitions to be a digital asset hub in asia. ""clifford lee, global head of fixed income at dbs, noted that this marks the first of many other steps as they work towards streamlining the bond issuance process. lee added:""while most bond tokenization exercises announced in asia to date tend to be repackaged forms of a conventional bond issue, the current transaction directly combines existing legal and tax infrastructure requirements with a direct issuance on the digital exchange in smaller lot sizes.  this bond token structure was only made possible because of the progressive development of singapore's legal and tax infrastructure, which can facilitate more sto issuances to broaden and deepen our capital markets.

""we are working with malaysia to ensure the continued flow of essential supplies between our two countries,"" said mr gan, speaking at a covid-19 multi-ministry task force. the government has been working closely with relevant agencies and companies to build up existing stock, further diversify its sources of food and essential items while also increasing local production, he said. ""i want to assure everyone that we have ample supply of food and essential items.  but please remember to only buy what you need,"" said mr gan, who is also co-chair of the task force. economic agencies in singapore are working with companies, especially those dealing with essential goods and services, to minimise disruptions to their supply lines, he added. mr gan visited supermarket chain fairprice and home-grown supply chain solutions company ych over the weekend to better understand the measures that have been put in place to ensure that there is sufficient food and essential items for all, he said. describing the covid-19 situation as ""extremely fluid"", mr gan said that as the pandemic continues to evolve globally, singapore must remain prepared and vigilant as a nation while staying flexible and adaptable. speaking after prime minister lee hsien loong's address on singapore's strategy against covid-19, mr gan said that the next few months are ""critical"". ""we are in a race with the virus.  the virus will attempt to spread wider and faster, and therefore we need to do more and do faster too, in vaccination, testing and contact tracing,"" he said. impact expected to be ""modest""touching on the potential impact of the tighter covid-19 restrictions during phase 2 (heightened alert) on singapore's economy, mr gan said that he expects the overall impact to be modest. ""the impact of the measures will differ across different sectors.  domestic, consumer-oriented sectors, such as food and beverage services, retail, and land transport, will see a greater impact,"" he added. ""on the other hand, the impact of these measures on outward-oriented sectors of the economy, such as manufacturing and finance and insurance, is likely to be less severe. ""last friday, finance minister lawrence wong announcedmore support measuresfor businesses affected by the tightened measures, extending wage subsidies to more sectors. ""even as we do our best to manage the situation at hand, mti will continue to give businesses, our full support to help them transform and seize new opportunities when they arise,"" said mr gan. downloadour appor subscribe to our telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:https://cna. asia/telegramit looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

""but the expert committee on covid-19 vaccination has reviewed global and local data relating to these sub-groups and is satisfied that vaccination is safe and efficacious for many of them, he added.  pregnant women will be able to register and book a vaccination appointment from friday if they are part of the population group eligible for vaccination. but mtf added that they should discuss the risks and benefits with their doctors to make an informed decision on the vaccination. singapore's director of medical services, associate professor kenneth mak, said this applies irrespective of a woman's stage of pregnancy.  if a woman becomes pregnant after getting her first dose, she can proceed with the second as well.  ""there is currently no evidence to suggest that the pfizer-biontech or moderna covid-19 vaccines may cause harm to pregnant women or their babies,"" mtf said. ""however, the committee recognises that the amount of data collected on this population segment is still much smaller compared to data on the general population. ""it added that it is also safe for women who are breastfeeding to be vaccinated and they do not have to suspend breastfeeding to receive the vaccine. meanwhile, cancer patients on active treatment can also be vaccinated, mtf said.  but they should do so in a hospital setting, after assessment by their treating specialists on their suitability. active treatment includes chemotherapy, immunotherapy or radiation therapy that individuals have undergone in the past three months or plan to undergo in the next two months. under the current guidelines, cancer patients on hormonal therapy can continue to be vaccinated at any available vaccination site. mtf said: ""cancer patients on active cancer treatment remain a vulnerable population that is at an increased risk of complications from covid-19. ""there is currently no evidence of any safety signals or increased rates of adverse events from mrna-based covid-19 vaccines for this group. ""the expert committee is also finalising guidelines on vaccination for cancer patients on treatment, including those who consult private specialists. additionally, those with severe cutaneous adverse reactions, which are rare drug-induced disorders, can also receive the vaccine. such reactions include the stevens-johnson syndrome a rare, serious disorder of the skin and mucous membranes; toxic epidermal necrolysis a reaction where the skin blisters and peels, and can be life threatening; and severe hypersensitivity and rash. these people may go to the vaccination centres, if they are part of the population group that is eligible. mtf said the committee is also reviewing the safety data on people with a history of anaphylaxis, which is a severe allergic reaction that can kill unless treated promptly, to allow more to be safely vaccinated.  the review aims to be completed in the next two weeks and will set out guidelines. mr ong said: ""specifically, the committee is reviewing the restriction for those who are not allergic to the mrna vaccine or its components, but to other substances like seafood, painkillers, antibiotics. ""he added that the review will take about two weeks with the intention of removing these restrictions and allowing more individuals in this group to be eligible for vaccination.  ""this is quite a sizeable group of over 30,000 individuals.  so the lifting of these restrictions will be a fairly meaningful one.

2021-06-02,Expect warm and humid nights in first half of June: Met Service.,"singapore: the warm and humid weather in may is expected to continue into the first half of june, the meteorological service singapore (mss) said on tuesday (jun 1). in the first fortnight of june, the nights are also expected to be warm and humid, with night-time minimum temperatures of up to 28 degrees celsius expected on some days. warm nights typically occur when the prevailing winds blow from the southeast and brings warm, humid air from the sea over the land, mss said. the daily temperature is forecast to range between 25 degrees celsius and 34 degrees celsius on most days, with the mercury potentially hitting 35 degrees celsius on a few days when there are few clouds in the sky. the prevailing light and variable winds over singapore and the surrounding region are forecast to strengthen and blow from the southeast or southwest. this signals the end of the inter-monsoon period and the start of the southwest monsoon season, which typically extends into september and is a generally drier season compared to other times of the year. the monsoon rain band is forecast to lie over the northern southeast asia region, bringing generally dry, warm, and humid conditions over singapore and the surrounding region on some days. on several days, there will be localised short-duration showers, at times with thunder, over a few parts of the island in the late morning and early afternoon. ""on one or two days, sumatra squalls moving from the strait of malacca to the south china sea are expected to bring island-wide thundery showers with occasional gusty winds in the morning,"" said the met service. the overall rainfall for the first half of june 2021 is likely to be below normal over most parts of singapore. review of may weatherin its review for the weather last month, the met service said that inter-monsoon conditions prevailed over singapore and the surrounding region, and the prevailing winds were generally light and blew from the east, southeast or southwest. thundery showers fell over parts of the island on most days, mainly in the late morning and afternoon.  they were due to strong daytime heating of land areas, a convergence of winds over singapore and the surrounding vicinity, or a combination of both factors, the met service said. the heaviest thundery showers during the month occurred on may 17 and may 18, particularly over the western and central parts of the island. on both occasions, a convergence of winds over singapore and the surrounding vicinity brought thundery showers in the late morning, early afternoon and in the night. in may, the highest rainfall of 117. 2mm was recorded on may 17 at jurong west, while the highest daily total was 132. 0mm, recorded at toa payoh. ""climatologically, may is one of the warmest months of the year,"" said the met service. the highest daily maximum temperature recorded across the island was at least 34 degrees celsius on 18 days, with the peak 35. 7 degrees celsius recorded at marina barrage on may 11. there were also a few warm nights where the night-time temperature was around 28 degrees celsius, particularly over the south-eastern part of the island. rainfall was slightly above average for most parts of singapore in may.  the highest rainfall anomaly of 69 per cent above average was recorded at jurong.  the anomaly was lowest at kranji at 56 per cent below average. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-06-02,Israel's 'magician' Netanyahu faces final curtain after record run.,"by jeffrey hellerjerusalem (reuters) long the familiar face of israel, benjamin netanyahu has held on as prime minister for more than a decade, clinging to power through a criminal indictment and four elections in the past two years alone. now, the question is whether the 71-year-old netanyahu, dubbed ""the magician"" by his admirers, has any cards left up his sleeve. after years in which he exerted near-complete hegemony over israeli politics, an emerging broad coalition of opponents could be about to unseat him. ""fraud of the century,"" an indignant netanyahu declared on sunday, after fellow right-winger naftali bennett turned against him and opted to align with centrist opposition chief yair lapid despite a public promise that he wouldn't. and while netanyahu's likud party has remained unflinchingly loyal to him, gideon saar, a disillusioned likud defector, is in line to join the new government-in-making as head of his own new horizon party. israeli political commentators said the political knives have been out for a while for netanyahu, the country's longest-serving leader. a sense that he was living on borrowed time after 12 consecutive years in office was compounded by a corruption trial now under way. the cases involve alleged favours to media tycoons and illegal receipt of expensive cigars and champagne.  netanyahu has denied all wrongdoing and says, without offering any evidence, that he is a victim of a deep state conspiracy against him. don't count him out yet, political commentators warn. ""it's still too early to declare that (the) ""bibi era"" of israeli politics has ended.  but if change is ultimately achieved, netanyahu will have been toppled by his colleagues on the right, who had it with his leadership,"" aluf benn, editor of the left-wing haaretz newspaper, wrote on monday. gracious in defeat?popularly known by his childhood nickname, bibi, netanyahu is the son of a historian and attended high school and college in the united states, where his father taught. never lost for a soundbite, his booming baritone hasresounded on the world stage since serving as israel's ambassador to the united nations from 1984 to 1988.  entering politics in israel as a likud legislator, he became party leader in 1993. netanyahu last lost the premiership, in his first term, before the turn of the millennium. his gracious handover after a 1999 election to then-labour party leader ehud barak would seem almost impossible today, in the context of netanyahu's frequent social media sniping against his rivals. at a changing of the guard in the prime minister's office, netanyahu and his wife sara smiled as they shook hands with barak and his spouse and chatted amiably with the couple with a glass of wine in their hands. this time around, if lapid meets a wednesday deadline to form a new government with bennett slated to go first as prime minister in a ""rotation"" deal netanyahu will likely be ready to pounce as leader of the opposition. in a possible taste of things to come, a stern-looking netanyahu went on television on monday to decry the creation of a ""dangerous, left-wing government"". the tone of his remarks like ""fraud of the century"" has unavoidable echoes of his closest international ally, himself now unseated, former u. s.  president donald trump. the diverse composition of an alliance of left-wing, centrist and right-wing parties would make it particularly unstable in a country so riven by political divisions that ""do-over"" elections have become the norm. but for netanyahu's loyalist voters, popularly dubbed ""bibists"", he remains a leader tough on security and a bulwark against pressure, even from trump's successor president joe biden, for any bold steps that could lead to a palestinian state. pro-netanyahu sentiment was still alive in southern israel this month, even as the area again came under intensive rocket attack from hamas in gaza. ""thank goodness we have a strong prime minister, bibi netanyahu,"" one resident said, without a hint of sarcasm, on israeli tv as he stood outside his parent's home after it was hit for a second time by a rocket during 11 days of fighting.

2021-06-02,Netizens question MOH & MOM protocols after another case of MDW being released early from SHN only to test positive for COVID-19 again later.,"about two weeks after former model and dj jade rasif publicly shared her traumatising experience with her migrant domestic worker (mdw)'s confusing quarantine order and subsequent events, news of a similar case has made the spotlight. in this case, the straits times reported on tuesday (1 june) of a hotel worker whose new maid was discharged from stay-home notice (shn) just five days in despite testing positive on the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) test.  she had arrived from indonesia on 15 april. according to reports, the mdw's employer, known only as ms lee, was concerned by the early discharge.  she checked with the isolation facility where the helper was quarantined and was told she had nothing to worry about as the indonesian's serology test came back positive.  they said this indicates that it was a past infection. unfortunately, two weeks later the helper tested positive on a mandatory swab test.  she had been living with ms lee and her two elderly parents and her brother since she was released from shn. following the second test, she was taken by ambulance to the national centre for infectious diseases (ncid). this is eerily similar to what happened with ms rasif's helper who was released from quarantine just three days after arriving in singapore instead of the full 14-days that was paid for. two weeks after being released, however, ms rasif received a phone call informing her that her helper needed to be tested for the virus again.  the test came back positive and the helper was picked up by an ambulance and taken to a quarantine centre. similar to ms rasif, when ms lee was informed that her helper was suspected to be positive with covid-19, her family was told they could still continue with their daily activities but decided to self-quarantine anyway. on 8 may when the helper was swabbed again, after testing negative twice, ms lee was told that her family of 12 would have to quarantine. ms lee was quoted by st saying: ""we were speechless at this point.  we thought it was safe to go about our daily lives, and had met so many people at work and school. . .  we were also worried for the safety of our parents, who have chronic illnesses. ""the family has since completed their quarantine and cleared their swab tests.  their helper's status remains unclear, however.  though she was discharged on 25 may after serving the full 21 days of shn and the family was told she was no longer infectious, a ministry of health (moh) doctor who spoke to ms lee said it was unclear if the helper had been reinfected. ms lee's and ms rasif's helpers are among several mdws who had been discharged from shn early only to test positive for covid-19 again a few weeks later. now, since 5 february, all mdws with recent travel history to high-risk countries are required to take an on-arrival serology test and pcr test. moh had clarified with toc back in march that the additional on arrival serology test ""will allow for the identification of workers who have recovered from an old covid-19 infection and have antibodies"". those who test positive on the serology test ""can therefore be released from shn,"" said moh, as it indicates a past infection. this second story in as many weeks about another mdw who was released early, has netizens on edge, as many on the straits times facebook page are questioning the protocols implemented by both the ministry of health (moh) and ministry of manpower (mom). many wondered if the moh shouldn't just require the helpers to complete the full shn period to be safe, instead of releasing them early even with a positive serology test to indicate a past infection. a couple of people even noted that the employers had paid for a full shn, so it shouldn't be a problem to have the helpers be quarantined for the full duration. one user expressed worry over the case and wondered how many other similar cases are out there and have ""contributed other infected cases"".  the user also wondered if these cases of ""past infected but till infectious"" are considered linked or unlinked. several people called for an investigation to be carried out into this ""serious lapse"" as well as moh's protocol and staff.  one person called out the mom for not clarifying these lapses yet. while another described these cases as signs of ""complacency"" on the government's part in allowing early

2021-06-02,PV chief Lim Tean denies modifying video recording of Catholic archbishop's homily with political label.,"people's voice party chief lim tean on tuesday (1 june) clarified that he did not modify the video recording of a homily delivered by singapore's roman catholic archbishop that the politician had posted on his own facebook page. a homily is a commentary that follows a reading of scripture that offers a ""public explanation of a sacred doctrine"" or text. footage of the homily — a homily delivered by archbishop william goh on 25 july last year — was reportedly doctored with a label titled ""appropriate sermon for pap (people's action party) cabinet"". mr lim, who is also a lawyer, said that he ""did not edit any part of it or add"" to the video of archbishop goh's homily. ""this video was sent to me on 29 may by a fellow montfortian.  i posted the video on my fb as i received it,"" he said. mr lim explained that he had decided to share the video on facebook as he believed it carried ""a very valuable message on leadership whatever the sphere a leader may be involved in – whether it be in religion, politics, business or otherwise"". ""as i said in my post, the message in the video is timeless.  those who watched the video in my post were similarly impressed with the archbishop's message as can be seen from their reactions,"" he said. noting that he has removed his facebook post of the video ""out of respect for the wish of the catholic church"", mr lim affirmed that he has ""the greatest respect for the catholic church and archbishop william goh"". ""i used to be a regular attendant at his friday teachings at the catholic seminary opposite the church of nativity, before his elevation to the office of archbishop of singapore,"" he said. ""below is a picture of the church of nativity at the cross-roads of upper serangoon road and punggol road.  my primary and secondary school montfort used to be located to the left of the church.  on the other side of the church was chij,"" he said, referencing a photograph he had attached to his clarification. the roman catholic archdiocese of singapore on monday earlier said that the homily in question centres ""the privilege of being chosen as a leader and how a true leader is not concerned about rewards but rather focused on serving and enriching others"". ""leadership is ultimately about servanthood and the joy of being a leader is when they see the lives of others transformed,"" said the church in its statement yesterday. ""however, by putting the label ""appropriate sermon for pap cabinet"" – it has caused upset and concern to the church and its followers as the doctored label leads to a misrepresentation of the intent and thrust of the homily. ""the church hopes that respect is given to religious materials such as homilies and other materials written or recorded on audio and video,"" it said. taking the homily out of its intended context from an ""emotional frame of mind"" and a need to further certain ""causes"" creates ""misunderstanding and sows discord and division"", the church added. ""the church does not practise partisan politics.  we seek only to proclaim the good news of jesus christ, bring good to society, promote harmony, unity and mutual understanding among all peoples. ""we, therefore, ask all parties concerned to refrain from doctoring the church's videos or images, stop the distribution, and remove such content from their social media accounts or postings,"" it said. the church also urged people to be ""vigilant"" against fake news. quoting a statement from pope francis in jan 2018, it said that no person can ""feel exempted from the duty of countering these falsehoods"". ""this is no easy task, since disinformation is often based on deliberately evasive and subtly misleading rhetoric,"" the pope remarked. in the homily he delivered in july last year, the archbishop emphasised the importance of humility in leadership, saying that a ""true leader is not concerned about rewards"" or ""what he can get out of it"". ""a true leader is concerned about serving the people.  about enriching the people, about empowering the lives of people . . .  he is more concerned about his responsibilities, the task given to him assigned to him, to look after those that the lord has entrusted to him,"" he said. archbishop goh added: ""if you are looking for earthly rewards, monetary rewards, you are not a leader.  you're a leader for yourself, not for the people. ""leaders, he stressed, ""must be ready for suffering"". "" don't seek leadership if you are not ready for suffering, to be misunderstood, to be slandered, to be taken for granted, to be used and abused,"" said the archbishop. watch: the video recording of archbishop william goh, the roman catholic archbishop of singapore, delivering a homily on leadership in july last year.   the left upper corner's text have been mosaiced off.

2021-06-02,'An obvious candidate'.,"liverpool idol jamie carragher sprung a surprise on everton when he urged the toffees to replace carlo ancelotti with another reds favourite, rafa benitez.  carragher worked under benitez for the entirety of the spaniard's six-year spell in charge at anfield, winning the champions league in 2005.  while there is no love lost between the two fierce merseyside rivals, the ex-england defender believes his former mentor would be a perfect fit at goodison park. ""as carlo ancelotti returns to real madrid, everton owner farhad moshiri will be wondering when he will next get the chance to appoint a former real madrid manager and champions league winner with premier league experience,"" carragher wrote in the telegraph. ""how about immediately? of the names instantly linked with everton as the ancelotti news broke, who is more qualified than my former liverpool boss rafa benitez?""rafa is available, settled in the area and i am sure he is ready if moshiri is prepared to consider one of the more shocking managerial appointments in merseyside football history. ""at the very least, benitez should be under consideration as moshiri begins yet another managerial quest.  not for the first time, before the owner decides the right candidate, he has to be clear of the football direction he wants to take. ""with ancelotti, everton pursued the tried-and-tested, proven experienced manager and stellar name.  if that is what moshiri still wants, benitez is an obvious candidate. ""ancelotti said farewell to everton on tuesday after just over 18 months in charge as he resigned in order to begin a second spell at the helm of real madrid.    having taken over in december 2019 with the toffees languishing in 18th place in the premier league, the italian helped them to recover to 12th by the end of his debut season and clinched 10th in the last campaign which finished in may.  despite that improvement, there was a feeling that everton should have been aiming higher, having led the table after six games and spending most of the first half of the season inside the top six.  benitez, meanwhile, has been out of work since january after cutting short his time at china's dalian professional for personal reasons.

2021-06-02,"Covid-19 unlikely transmitted between HDB blocks through wastewater system: Experts, Singapore News & Top Stories.","read 3 articles daily and stand to win st rewards, including the st news tablet worth $398. spin the wheel for st read and win now. singapore it is not possible for residents of one block of flats to catch covid-19 from residents in a neighbouring block via the wastewater system, infectious disease experts said on tuesday (june 1). on monday, all residents of two housing board blocks in hougang 501 and 507 in avenue 8 were asked to go for mandatory tests after covid-19 viral fragments were detected in wastewater samples collected from the blocks. the two blocks are within the same area as block 506 hougang avenue 8, which saw its residents mass-tested for the virus after a few patients were found to be living there. the ministry of health (moh) had identified 11 covid-19 cases from at least four households in the block, including two that were picked up during the testing exercise. professor paul tambyah, president of the asia pacific society of clinical microbiology and infection, said: ""detection of covid-19 fragments in wastewater does not mean that was the mode of transmission – it is a screening tool to pick up the presence of individuals who are shedding the virus. "" in response to queries, a pub spokesman said that sanitary systems here are ""closed systems"" where the pipes are air- and watertight to ensure that no foul air, viruses or bacteria can travel between household or blocks. ""for instance, water seals located in the u-shaped sections of underfloor pipes in the toilet bowl and floor traps for sinks, wash basins and showers act as barriers to prevent foul air that may contain bacteria and viruses from entering a unit's premises,"" the spokesman added. ""these water seals are maintained by regular water flow from the sinks, wash basins, showers or flushing of the water cisterns. ""he added that sanitary pipes are hydraulically and air-pressure tested by licensed plumbers to ensure no leakage in the system. ""backflow of used water will not occur in a properly designed system like singapore's, where the used water flows in pipes with proper gradient and is conveyed in a downward direction quickly through vertical down pipes,"" he said. professor dale fisher, an infectious disease expert at the national university of singapore (nus), said that the infected residents of block 506 may have transmitted covid-19 to their neighbours in blocks 501 and 507 through other means, such as a contaminated surface. professor teo yik ying, dean of nus' saw swee hock school of public health, said: ""it could be that there are people who are asymptomatically infected in these blocks, and we should not rule out the possibility of false detection as well. ""it is otherwise too early to speculate how the covid-19 fragments could have been detected if there are truly no infected cases in these blocks. ""rather than viral spread through the sewage system, prof tambyah said ""it is far more likely that people living in adjacent blocks visited each other, and, hence, the wastewater surveillance picked up the positive cases in the adjacent blocks"". ""or, even more likely, there was a common source like a nearby coffeeshop that has yet to be identified,"" he added. testing for residents in the two blocks began on tuesday and will end on thursday. when the straits times arrived at block 507 in hougang at about 9am on tuesday, testing operations were in full swing and residents had formed a queue to get swabbed.

madam koh beng hup, who works in a mcdonald's outlet, said: ""i'm not worried about myself because i feel fine.  but i'm worried that someone in the block might have the virus. ""i've always been a careful person.  i wash my hands when leaving home or coming back. ""the 60-year-old added that the swabbing process took only about five minutes from start to finish. mrs sasikala ramaiyan, who helps out at a minimart in block 501, said she will be tested on wednesday. ""testing is just a precaution, there's nothing wrong with that.  we don't know for sure, but we have to face whatever that comes.  we cannot panic,"" said the 41-year-old. ""it's good that they are testing everyone.  we don't have to guess whether this person or that person has the virus.  whoever tests positive will be isolated, and the government can take the necessary precautions. ""over at block 745 yishun street 72, testing was also under way for its residents. moh had announced the tests on monday after six covid-19 cases were detected in the block, with subsequent wastewater tests detecting virus fragments. testing for the yishun block will end on wednesday.

on tuesday, prof teo and prof fisher also shared their opinions on a message circulating that the earlier infections in hougang's block 506 could have spread through the sewage system to residents living in the same ""stack"" meaning they share the same unit number but are on different floors. referring to the cases in block 506, the message said: ""suspect cause of transmission is the wc (water closet), when flushing wc air from other units get into the toilet and infect the guys. ""the message also urged recipients to put down their toilet covers before flushing. prof fisher said: ""the 'column' of cases is in itself remarkable, but i would think contamination of an elevator or stairwell is more likely in seeing this pattern. ""prof teo said that transmissions through the sewage system between units in the same stack are unlikely, except in the case of leakages in the wastewater piping, or if a wastewater system had not been properly installed. both said that closing toilet lids before flushing is a good practice, as toilet plumes from flushing can disperse aerosols containing waste materials. separately, the national environment agency (nea), which is in charge of wastewater testing for covid-19, said that, as at may, it has expanded the wastewater surveillance programme to about 110 locations. this includes singapore's four water reclamation plants, workers' dormitories and other high-population density living premises such as nursing homes and student hostels. ""we continually assess the situation together with other agencies on wastewater surveillance points to complement clinical testing,"" said an nea spokesman. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

residents of two housing board blocks in hougang 501 and 507 in avenue 8 were asked to go for mandatory tests after covid-19 viral fragments were detected in wastewater samples collected from the

of health (moh) had identified 11 covid-19 cases from at least four households in the block, including two that were picked up during the testing exercise.', 'professor paul tambyah, president of the asia pacific society of clinical microbiology and infection, said: ""detection of covid-19 fragments in wastewater does not mean that was the mode of transmission – it is a screening tool to pick up the presence of individuals who are shedding the virus. ""', 'in response to queries, a pub spokesman said that sanitary systems here are ""closed systems"" where the pipes are air- and watertight to ensure that no foul air, viruses or bacteria can travel between household or blocks.', '""for instance, water seals located in the u-shaped sections of underfloor pipes in the toilet bowl and floor traps for sinks, wash basins and showers act as barriers to prevent foul air that may contain bacteria and viruses from entering a unit\'s premises,"" the spokesman added.', '""these water seals are maintained by regular water flow from the sinks, wash basins, showers or flushing of the water cisterns.', '""he added that sanitary pipes are hydraulically and air-pressure tested by licensed plumbers to ensure no leakage in the system.', '""backflow of used water will not occur in a properly designed system like singapore\'s, where the used water flows in pipes with proper gradient and is conveyed in a downward direction quickly through vertical down pipes,"" he said.', 'professor dale fisher, an infectious disease expert at the national university of singapore (nus), said that the infected residents of block 506 may have transmitted covid-19 to their neighbours in blocks 501 and 507 through other means, such as a contaminated surface.', 'professor teo yik ying, dean of nus\' saw swee hock school of public health, said: ""it could be that there are people who are asymptomatically infected in these blocks, and we should not rule out the possibility of false detection as well.', '""it is otherwise too early to speculate how the covid-19 fragments could have been detected if there are truly no infected cases in these blocks.', '""rather than viral spread through the sewage system, prof tambyah said ""it is far more likely that people living in adjacent blocks visited each other, and, hence, the wastewater surveillance picked up the positive cases in the adjacent blocks"".', '""or, even more likely, there was a common source like a nearby coffeeshop that has yet to be identified,"" he added.', 'testing for residents in the two blocks began on tuesday and will end on thursday.', 'when the straits times arrived at block 507 in

""there are still some parts of the supply chain for which they need to be stored at minus 70 deg c. ""he said viral vector vaccines are ""much more robust"", as they are more stable and can be stored at fridge temperatures. the one-shot johnson & johnson vaccine and the two-dose vaccines use viral vector technology.  they use a harmless, weakened adenovirus ""common"" viruses that cause illnesses like colds to carry genetic instructions into the body to prompt cells to mount an immune response. inactivated virus vaccines like the sinopharm and sinovac vaccines use actual coronaviruses taken from infected patients.  ""they are inactivated through chemical means, and so they are no longer alive and they can't replicate and they can't cause disease,"" said dr soon. the body mounts an immune response to the coronavirus proteins, and this helps a person build up immunity, he explained. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-06-02,UN Nuclear Watchdog Concerned Over Undeclared Iran Sites.,"iran failed to answer questions about fourth site where natural uranium may have been present: un agencythe un nuclear watchdog monday voiced concern that iran had not clarified queries over possible undeclared nuclear activity, adding that its enriched uranium stockpile was 16 times over the limit. the two reports issued by the international atomic energy agency (iaea) on monday are the first substantive reports since iran suspended some inspections in february. last week the iaea said it had extended a temporary agreement with iran until june 24 which has allowed many inspections to continue. the report said iaea director general rafael grossi was ""concerned that the technical discussions between the agency and iran have not yielded the expected results,"" referring to exchanges on the sites where undeclared nuclear activity may have occurred. the conclusion comes despite a ""proactive and focused effort"" launched by the iaea in april ""to break the impasse"" over the sites. the iaea says that the results of its inspection work have established ""a clear indication that nuclear material and/or equipment contaminated by nuclear material has been present"" at three undeclared locations, with most of the activity in question dating back to the early 2000s. the agency also said iran has failed to answer questions regarding a fourth site where natural uranium may have been present between 2002 and 2003 in the form of a metal disc. iran and world powers are engaged in talks in vienna to rescue the 2015 nuclear deal after former us president donald trump walked away from it in 2018 and reimposed crippling sanctions on tehran. trump's successor joe biden has signalled his willingness to revive the plan. for this to happen, the us would need to return to the accord and lift the sanctions reinstated by trump while tehran would have to re-commit to full compliance with nuclear obligations it progressively withdrew from since 2019. in a separate report, the iaea said iran's stockpile of enriched uranium is around 16 times the limit laid down in the 2015 deal with world powers. it gave an estimate of a stockpile of 3,241 kilogrammes (7,145 pounds) but said that it was not able to verify the total. the limit laid down in the 2015 deal was 300 kilogrammes of uranium in a particular compound form, the equivalent of 202. 8 kilogrammes of uranium. 'sabotage' blast -a senior diplomat with knowledge of the issue said that while the suspension of some inspections meant that the iaea could not give precise figures for the stockpile, its level of access to declared sites has not been greatly reduced and its stockpile estimate would still be accurate to within a few percentage points. the rate of production of enriched uranium has slowed since the last quarterly report from the iaea in february. in april iran said a ""small explosion"" had hit its natanz nuclear facility, an act that tehran branded ""sabotage"" by its arch-foe israel. in monday's report the iaea estimated 62. 8 kilogrammes of the uranium stockpile had been enriched up to 20 percent and 2. 4 kilogrammes up to 60 percent. under the 2015 deal, the enrichment level was meant to be capped at 3. 67 percent, well below the 90 percent purity needed for a nuclear weapon. the latest report will be presented to the iaea's board of governors next week. talks to restore the 2015 deal are taking place in vienna as iran prepares for presidential elections on june 18. the press had widely predicted a showdown between ultraconservative judiciary chief ebrahim raisi and moderate conservative ali larijani, a key domestic backer of the 2015 deal. however, last week larijani was barred from standing.

2021-06-02,Singapore to use DIY Covid-19 antigen test kits at construction sites.,"
                    tuesday, 01 jun 2021
                singapore, june 1 (the straits times/ann): to further reduce the risk of transmission at worksites, the use of antigen rapid tests (art) will now be piloted at construction worksites for those who are not living in dormitories. these tests, which will generally be conducted once every three days, will be administered by workers through do-it-yourself covid-19 test kits, the building and construction authority (bca) said on monday (may 31). this comes on top of the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) rostered routine testing that these workers continue to be required to take. currently, all individuals at construction worksites, whether vaccinated or not, must be tested once every seven days or once every 14 days, depending on their risk level, such as whether they stay in dormitories. in a circular, the bca said that each employer will appoint trained personnel as supervisors to ensure proper infection prevention controls and the correct use of the test kits. some worksites will also designate and train specific personnel who administer the swabs for their colleagues, the bca added. the move to pilot such self-administered tests at worksites comes after prime minister lee hsien loong's announcement on monday that do-it-yourself covid-19 test kits will soon be available at pharmacies here. these tests, which are simple to use, can be administered by front-line workers on their own, if they wish to test themselves frequently or even daily, pm lee said. pcr tests are the most accurate, but usually take a day or two for results to be known.  the less accurate art returns results in about 30 minutes and is used heavily for pre-event testing. the pilot use of such art at worksites is being overseen by the bca, the ministry of health (moh) and the ministry of manpower (mom). in its circular, the bca said it is currently engaging worksites on the pilot initiative, and that more worksites will be progressively included as singapore ramps up its supply of antigen rapid tests. more details on the requirements and implementation of the tests will be provided when they are ready, including the necessary training and preparation required, the bca added. moh said on monday that it will be extending the use of arts further, with pilots in student hostels in autonomous universities.  it will also work with capitaland to run pilots at one or two selected malls for tenants and people who work there. those whose rapid test returns a positive result will need to take a pcr test at a swab and send home public health preparedness clinic or regional screening centre to confirm if they have covid-19.  they are required to self-isolate until they receive a negative pcr test result.

2021-06-02,Irish overseas travellers face significant extra expense of PCR tests.,"paying through the nose? a pcr test for covid-19.  photograph: arun sankar/afp via gettythe cost of private covid-19 tests at home and abroad is likely to come into sharp focus in the weeks ahead as international borders reopen for leisure travel and people are allowed to go on holidays as long as they meet certain criteria. under the rules of the digital green certificate, people will be able to move freely across the eu as long as they have been fully vaccinated, can show they have recovered from covid-19 or can produce a negative covid-19 test. under european commission proposals, an exemption from travel restrictions will also apply to those with a negative pcr test 72 hours before departure or a negative antigen test 48 hours before departure. countries will be able to choose which conditions it imposes and at present ireland is favouring negative pcr tests over antigen tests, a decision that could prove costly for consumers. apart from having recovered from covid-19 the only option on the table for children and for many young adults will be a negative test, but that will add considerably to the cost of travel.  at the very least a person will have to pay about €150 to cover the cost of tests leaving the country and returning home. but the costs at home and abroad vary wildly.  both rocdoc and randox are carrying out pcr testing at dublin airport and other locations, with the former charging €95 and the latter charging €89.  both promise results within 24 hours. private clinics on the algarve, meanwhile, are charging €50 for tests while in spain the price is about €55. in some countries the cost of pcr testing is determined by the government and can be subsidised or taxes are not charged.  in europe, riga airport is the cheapest, with pcr tests costing €35. if the government adopts the eu proposals and also allows antigen tests, then the prices will fall considerably.  an antigen test at dublin airport is €49, while the cost of such a test in spain is €25. everything you need to know about the covid-19 outbreak subscribe. dailystay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and eveningsign upinvalid email or password.

2021-06-02,Can people vaccinated against covid-19 still spread coronavirus? Does that leave the unvaccinated vulnerable?.,"﻿
we all know that the dreaded disease of polio has been eliminated as an endemic disease in most developed and developing countries.  outbreaks have occasionally occurred in subsets of unvaccinated susceptible individuals.  
according to a paper published in the us national library of medicine, infection in the intestinal tract with the vaccine strain of poliovirus results in virus shedding in the faeces and the risk that the contacts of a recipient might become infected. 
the vaccine virus can revert to a virulent form, and this lends demonstrated biological plausibility to the finding that occasional contacts of vaccine recipients contract polio. 
this means that all children in the vulnerable category need to be vaccinated otherwise exposure to the virus in this form that is shed through the faeces of the vaccinated children can turn the unvaccinated ones vulnerable. are these fears applicable to the covid-19 vaccination scenario?
are the vaccinated ones capable of transferring the covid-19 disease to the unvaccinated ones?
the us centers for disease control and communicable diseases (cdc) says in a report:
how safe or vulnerable are the unvaccinated ones amidst the ones who have been already vaccinated against covid-19? will the vaccinated ones transmit the disease asymptomatically to the vulnerable ones?
a growing body of evidence indicates that people fully vaccinated with an mrna vaccine (pfizer-biontech and moderna) are less likely to have an asymptomatic infection or to transmit sars-cov-2 to others.  studies are underway to learn more about the benefits of the johnson & johnson/janssen vaccine. 
however, the risk for sars-cov-2 infection in fully vaccinated people cannot be completely eliminated as long as there is continued community transmission of the virus. 
at this time, there are limited data on vaccine effectiveness in people who are immunocompromised.  people with immunocompromising conditions, including those taking immunosuppressive medications, should discuss the need for personal protective measures after vaccination with their healthcare provider. 
this updated science brief synthesizes the scientific evidence supporting cdc's guidance for fully vaccinated people and will continue to be updated as more information becomes available. the us centers for disease control and prevention changed its guidelines about mask-wearing on may 13, 2021, it declared that anyone who is fully vaccinated can participate in indoor and outdoor activities, large or small, without wearing a mask or physical distancing. anthony fauci, the chief medical adviser to president biden, said the new guideline is ""based on the evolution of the science"" and ""serves as an incentive"" for the almost two-thirds of americans who are not yet fully vaccinated to go ahead and get the shot. yet there remain some sections of the population who cannot be vaccinated for reasons other than vaccine hesitancy, such as:vaccines are no guarantee against infection:
though the world health organisation demands vaccine efficacy of at least 50% before granting approval, the current lot of vaccines against covid-19 has vastly outperformed expectations.  for a vaccine to be effective, it doesn't need to prevent the germ from infecting an immunized person.  vaccines train the body's immune system, so when it actually encounters the disease-causing pathogen, it's ready to mount an optimum response. can a vaccinated person spread coronavirus?immunology experts also work on the part of enabling a vaccinated person to transmit a lesser viral load after vaccination.  but one cannot say for sure whether a vaccinated person does carry a lesser viral load by the virtue of having been vaccinated against covid-19. this disease is new and poses a particular challenge because people with asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic infections can spread the disease – and insufficient contact tracing and testing mean those without symptoms are rarely detected. one thing that researchers have realised though is the fact that if a previously vaccinated individual does get sick with covid-19 in what is called a ""breakthrough infection,"" – he or she manifests symptoms that are by far milder.  people who test positive for covid-19 after getting just their first vaccine dose are found to have lower levels of virus in their bodies than unvaccinated people who tested positive.  this decreased viral load perhaps makes them less infectious as they have much fewer virus that could be spread to others. a preprint study that has not yet been peer-reviewed suggests that the moderna mrna covid-19 vaccine can produce coronavirus-fighting antibodies in the oral and nasal fluid, reports the wire.  since the sars-cov-2 enters the human body through the respiratory tract, antibodies in the mouth and nose should block the virus from getting into the body, effectively providing ""sterilizing immunity. "" would this render the vaccinated people naturally unable to spread the virus through respiratory droplets? the jury is still out on that. 

meanwhile, follow the covid-appropriate sops even if you have been vaccinated.  wear the mask when in public or in the presence of anyone who is not quarantined with you, wash hands with soap and water often, maintain appropriate social distance, use sanitiser as and when necessary. disclaimer: tips and suggestions mentioned in the article are for general information purpose only and should

""following an interview with the said staff (member), the madrasah made a police report on the unauthorised transfer of the madrasah's confidential documents to third parties,"" said muis. the police confirmed to the straits times that a report was lodged and that they are looking into the matter. the council said the staff member has resigned from madrasah irsyad with immediate effect and that the school will not be able to provide further details, given that the matter is under police investigation. it added that the stolen documents are linked to an ongoing review of the madrasah's financial transactions. muis reiterated that ""it takes any allegations of financial irregularities very seriously and is undertaking the necessary steps to look into the matter"". the review had been stated in a parliamentary reply on april 5 by minister-in-charge of muslim affairs masagos zulkifli, who was responding to mr faisal manap of the workers' party. mr faisal, an mp for aljunied grc, had then asked, among other things, for details on any links between madrasah irsyad and irsyad trust limited (itl), and if any investigations were conducted in 2019 and 2020 regarding allegations of abuse of power in the madrasah. the allegations were regarding a former senior director of madrasah at muis, who had also been chief executive of itl since 2014. mr faisal had asked if the financial reports for both these bodies had been made public, and if there had been any transfer of funds from the madrasah to itl. mr masagos had answered then that there was no affiliation between itl and madrasah irsyad, and that the two had not been affiliated with each other since january. itl was established as a separate company in 2006 by the madrasah's management committee, under the name irsyad foundation limited. in august 2008, muis brought madrasah irsyad into its joint madrasah system, but the school's management continued to oversee its fund-raising efforts, including international projects in training and education.  funds raised from these projects went towards supporting madrasah irsyad's local operations. in 2014, madrasah irsyad's management moved the international side of its fund-raising efforts to itl. during a 2016 audit of madrasah irsyad's accounts, however, it was discovered that the school's management had endorsed a transfer of $2 million to itl for its international operations. ""muis requested itl to repay the monies to the madrasah.  itl returned the $2 million in full to the madrasah in 2016,"" said mr masagos. he added that after a review last year, madrasah irsyad decided to de-prioritise its international projects.  both the school and itl agreed that they would no longer be affiliated with each other from january this year, which meant that itl could no longer use the school's branding for its international projects. muis then asked for a review of the financial transactions between madrasah irsyad and itl, which is ongoing, and will consider further actions based on the findings of the review. the minister said that while muis had conducted an internal investigation into madrasah irsyad staff after a complaint, it was not linked to itl or the former muis senior director, who resigned in 2016. he added that while it was not muis' practice for religious schools to publish their financial statements, each school is required to submit them to muis for final audit purposes. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-06-02,"Higher risk of dengue transmission as Aedes mosquito population growing islandwide, says NEA.","singapore: the national environment agency (nea) is expecting an increasing number of dengue cases as singapore enters the warmer months of the year. this is due to the accelerated breeding and maturation of the aedes aegypti mosquito and shorter incubation period of the dengue virus, the agency said on tuesday (jun 1). the increasing population of the aedes mosquito across the island is also significant, it said. more than 2,700 dengue cases have been reported in singapore since the start of the year.  there are currently 22 active dengue clusters. while recent weekly dengue cases have been lower than in the same period last year, when singapore experienced a""historic"" outbreak, the figures are still higher than those reported in 2017 and 2018, said nea. the population of the aedes mosquito grew by about 30 per cent in april compared to january, said the agency. the population remains high in areas including:- clementi west street 1;- hougang avenues 10, 6 and 8;- jurong east avenue 1 and jurong east street 32; and- mei chin road, mei ling street and stirling road. ""if left unchecked, the current high aedes aegypti mosquito population, coupled with the circulation of previously uncommon dengue virus serotypes and a sizeable proportion of people staying in and working from home, would add to the dengue risk this year,"" said nea. lower immunity and ""biting opportunities""nea highlighted that dengue cases caused by the less common virus serotypes denv-3 and denv-4 made up more than half the serotypes sampled since february. ""denv-3 has not been dominant since about three decades ago, and the incidence of denv-4 has been consistently low. ""thus the population immunity for denv-3 and denv-4 is low, and more people are susceptible to transmission of the virus,"" said the agency. denv-3 has been detected in the dengue cluster at cashew terrace/hazel park terrace, while denv-4 has been detected in clusters at hougang central and pasir ris street 21, it said. the agency also noted that more people are staying in and working at home during phase 2 (heightened alert) of singapore's covid-19 prevention efforts, due to last until jun 13. this could translate into more ""biting opportunities"" for the day-biting aedes mosquito, potentially increasing the risk of dengue transmission, it said. the agency cited a study that found almost 50 per cent more dengue infections were reported during singapore's ""circuit breaker"" last year than there should have been, based on mathematical modelling. ""most of the excess infections were among adults of working age (20 to 64 years old) – people who would normally have been in workplaces, some of which would have been air-conditioned, instead of their homes,"" said nea. the agency carried out the epidemiological study with the national university of singapore saw swee hock school of public health in august last year. nea urged members of the public to remain vigilant and take steps to prevent mosquito breeding. the agency said it continues to conduct targeted inspections at areas with higher mosquito populations and has stepped up operations at dengue clusters. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-06-02,Iran nuclear program: UN watchdog unable to access data since February.,"international atomic energy agency says it can provide only an estimate of iran's stockpilelast modified on tue 1 jun 2021 01. 08 bstthe united nations' atomic watchdog hasn't been able to access data important to monitoring iran's nuclear program since late february when the islamic republic started restricting international inspections of its facilities, the agency has said. the international atomic energy agency (iaea) reported on monday in a confidential document distributed to member countries and seen by the associated press that it has ""not had access to the data from its online enrichment monitors and electronic seals, or had access to the measurement recordings registered by its installed measurement devices"" since 23 february. while the iaea and iran earlier acknowledged the restrictions limited access to surveillance cameras at iranian facilities, monday's report indicated they went much further.  the iaea acknowledged it could provide only an estimate of iran's overall nuclear material stockpile as it continues to enrich uranium at its highest ever level. last week, the un's nuclear inspectorate said iran's failure to provide credible explanations for traces of uranium found at two undeclared sites was ""a big problem"" that was affecting the country's credibility. rafael grossi, the director general of the iaea, said: ""we know that something happened here.  there is no way round it.  we have found this.  there was material here.  when was this? what has happened with this equipment? where is the material.  they have to answer. ""he said it was not his job to give an ultimatum to iran to explain the cause of the unexplained uranium found at three sites, one of which iran said was a carpet cleaning facility, but to report the technical truth.  ""they know they have to provide explanations.  we are asking them to come clean with all these things because it can only help them. ""he said he has told iranian officials: ""this is going to affect the credibility of your country in general and the chances for any bigger wider agreement that you want to enter with your counterparts in the jcpoa [joint comprehensive plan of action]. ""iran started limiting inspections in a bid to put pressure on us president joe biden to lift crippling sanctions reimposed after then president donald trump pulled out of the 2015 nuclear deal with iran unilaterally in 2018. talks are currently underway in vienna for the us to rejoin the deal, known as the joint comprehensive plan of action, or jcpoa. under the deal, the iaea placed around 2,000

2021-06-02,Israel inches closer to government without Netanyahu.,"jerusalem: israeli nationalist hardliner naftali bennett said on sunday (may 30) that he would join apotential coalition governmentthat could end the rule of the country's longest-serving leader, prime minister benjamin netanyahu. lawmakers opposed to right-wing netanyahu have been in intense talks ahead of a wednesday deadline, as a ceasefire held following the latestdeadly military conflict with hamasin the gaza strip. netanyahu, 71, who faces trial on fraud, bribery and breach of trust charges, which he denies, has clung to power throughout a period of political turmoil that has seen four inconclusive elections in under two years. a march vote saw netanyahu's likud party gain the most seats, but he again failed to form a government. opposition leader and former tv anchor yair lapid now has until wednesday evening to build a rival coalition. lapid, 57, is seeking a diverse alliance which the israeli media has dubbed a bloc for ""change"", which would include bennett as well as arab-israeli lawmakers. in his determination to bring down the hawkish prime minister, lapid has offered to share power and let bennett, 49, serve the first term in a rotating premiership. bennett, after meeting members of his religious-nationalist yamina party, said on sunday: ""i will do everything to form a national unity government with my friend yair lapid. ""lapid and bennett's parties started talks on sunday night to formalise the deal, they said in a statement. religious-nationalist yamina won seven seats in mar 23 elections, but one member has refused to join an anti-netanyahu coalition. netanyahu, who has been in office for 12 consecutive years after an earlier three-year term, in his own televised address minutes later lashed out at the plan, calling it ""a danger for the security of israel"". ""desperate position""he had earlier on sunday tried to cling to power by offering his own, last-ditch power-sharing agreement to several former allies including bennett. he warned that israel would otherwise be ruled by a dangerous ""left-wing"" alliance. lapid has until 11. 59 pm local time on wednesday (4. 59am on thursday, singapore time) to build a coalition of at least 61 deputies, a majority in the 120-seat knesset. a lapid government would also include the centrist blue and white party of netanyahu's rival benny gantz and the hawkish new hope party of his former ally gideon saar. avigdor lieberman's pro-settlement yisrael beitenu party as well as historically powerful labour and the dovish meretz party would also join. the shaky arrangement would need the backing of some arab-israeli lawmakers of palestinian descent in order to pass a confirmation vote in parliament. the intense talks follow weeks of escalating tensions between israel and the palestinians, including a deadly 11-day exchange of rocket fire from gaza and devastating israeli airstrikes. the war with hamas that ended with a may 21 truce, as well as violence in the occupied west bank and in mixed jewish-arab towns in israel, initially appeared to leave netanyahu more likely to hold onto power. but political scientist gayil talshir at hebrew university told afp on sunday that israel was now ""closer than ever"" to a coalition of change, adding: ""netanyahu is in a desperate position. ""netanyahu's likud party won 30 seats in the march elections, but failed to form a governing coalition after his far-right partners refused to sit with arab factions or receive their support. lapid, whose party won 17 seats, was then given four weeks to form a government. netanyahu had previously pushed for yet another election israel's fifth in a little more than two years. more elections?on sunday, netanyahu offered his own proposal of a rotation agreement with bennett and saar.  but saar on twitter said that he remained committed to ""replacing the netanyahu regime"". netanyahu in a video then called on saar and bennett to ""come now, immediately"" to meet him and join a three-way rotation government, warning that they were in a ""crucial moment for the security, character and future of the state of israel"". lapid's ""change"" coalition also still faced several obstacles. some right-wing lawmakers object to a partnership with politicians from israel's arab minority, who make up about a fifth of the population. the recent gaza conflict sparked inter-communal clashes between jewish and arab israelis in mixed cities. arab politicians have also been divided about joining a government headed by bennett, who supports expanding israeli settlements in the occupied west bank, where palestinians hope to create a state. even with support from an arab party, a new coalition in israel is unlikely to reverse years of israeli settlement construction or bring peace any time soon with hamas in gaza. if the anti-netanyahu camp does not manage to form a government on time, a majority of 61 lawmakers could vote to ask the president to name a new premier. another scenario would see the country return, yet again, to the polls. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

""while i have enjoyed being at everton i have been presented with an unexpected opportunity which i believe is the right move for me and my family at this time,"" ancelotti said in a statement on the everton website. ancelotti has one of the most-decorated cvs in world football and won the champions league with real in 2014, helping the spaniards to their fabled 'decima' (10th) european crown, before being sacked 12 months later. the 61-year-old is one of three coaches, along with former liverpool manager bob paisley and zidane, to have won the european cup or champions league on three occasions, having also led ac milan to glory in 2003 and 2007. his honours list includes league titles in four different countries at milan, chelsea, paris st germain and bayern munich over a 26-year managerial career. ""carlo ancelotti will be the new first team coach for the next three seasons,"" a brief real madrid statement read. ancelotti will sign his contract and be presented to the media on wednesday. the move comes following zidane's decision to step down five days after his team were pipped to the la liga title by city rivals atletico madrid. real finished two points behind atletico, were knocked out of the champions league in the semi-finals by eventual winners chelsea and suffered a humiliating copa del rey exit to third division minnows alcoyano during a rare trophy-less season. zidane subsequently hit out at the club in an open letter, saying: ""i'm leaving because i feel the club no longer has the faith in me i need, nor the support to build something in the medium or long term. "" it brought an end to a second spell in charge of the club that was fraught with tension. the end of the frenchman's tenure was surrounded by questions over his reliance on players the wrong side of 30 like luka modric, toni kroos and karim benzema and his willingness to oversee the rebuild the club felt it needed. ancelotti was considered something of a coup when everton announced his appointment on a four-and-a-half year contract in december 2019, and he guided the club to a 12th-place premier league finish in his first season. the italian then oversaw an impressive summer transfer window, signing colombian star james rodriguez from real madrid as well as the likes of allan, abdoulaye doucoure and ben godfrey, and everton started the campaign in superb form, winning their first seven games in all competitions. the toffees remained in european contention throughout the season but a dip in form towards the end of the campaign, when they picked up three wins from their final 12 league games, saw them slide to a disappointing mid-table finish.

rocketnews24 japanesedecision comes days after tennis star says she would not speak with reporters during event. last thursday, three days prior to the start of the french open, tennis star naomi osaka announced that she would be refusing to speak with the media during the tournament.  the 23-year-old declared ""i'm just not going to subject myself to people that doubt me"" while taking issue with athletes being ""asked questions that we've been asked multiple times before or asked questions that bring doubt into our minds"" and describing the way competitors are treated after a loss as ""kicking a person while they're down. ""osaka said she was prepared for fines, and the tournament organizers quickly handed down a us$15,000 one, with the warning that future refusals to participate in contractually obligated media sessions would lead to larger fines and possible disqualifications.  the controversy didn't prevent her from defeating opponent patricia maria tig in straight sets on sunday, but rather than go on to the second round, osaka has opted to voluntarily withdraw from the tournament entirely. ""i think now the best thing for the tournament, the other players and my well-being is that i withdraw so that everyone can get back to focusing on the tennis going on in paris,"" said osaka in a statement posted through her twitter account.  ""i never wanted to be a distraction and i accept that my timing was not ideal and my message could have been clearer. ""part of that clarity comes later in the statement, where osaka says that on top of being an introvert, she has struggled with depression since the 2018 us open.  as her first grand slam title, some might have assumed the tournament was a joyous occasion for osaka, but her victories over 15-year-old coco gauff and runner-up serena williams were accompanied by intense emotion from her opponents, and in interviews in the days following her win osaka's statement included "" i really didn't want to think about it because it wasn't necessarily the happiest memory for me,"" and ""of course i'm happy that i won a grand slam. . . but i feel like it was so strange, i didn't just want to think about it. . . i wanted to just push it to the side. ""▼ osaka's full statementpic. twitter. com/ln2annoayd""i wanna apologize especially to all the cool journalists who i may have hurt,"" osaka explains, and she goes on to say she'll be taking an indefinite hiatus from the sport with ""i'm gonna take some time away from the court now. . .  love you guys i'll see you when i see you.

(tsm) or tsmc will collaborate with japanese companies on a government-backed project to advance chipmaking technologies in japan.  according to nikkei asia, japan's position in the global semiconductor industry has been declining.  in a bid to improve the country's competitiveness, the government sought tsmc's help.  as a result, tsmc will set up a research and development facility in japan in partnership with the government.  it will use that facility to collaborate with more than 20 japanese companies on semiconductor technology advancements.  the participating companies will include ibiden, asahi kasei, shin-etsu chemical, shibaura mechatronics, and nagase.  tsmc will invest about $337 million in the project, which is about half of the project's cost.  the japanese government will also fund the project.  the research facility will be set up at the national institute of advanced industrial science and technology in ibaraki prefecture.  the project will begin with a trial before entering full operation in 2022.  in addition to helping advance japan's chip technology, the japanese government is also expecting tsmc to set up a manufacturing plant in the country.  tsmc is the world's largest contract chipmaker with customers including apple (aapl) and qualcomm (qcom).  (see tsmc stock analysis on tipranks) on april 15, susquehanna analyst mehdi hosseini reiterated a sell rating on tsm but raised the price target from $83 to $85, implying 27. 57% downside potential.  the analyst observed that tsmc's $100 billion capex plan would drive revenue growth for the next three years, but depreciation and higher operating expenses will weigh on earnings.  ""strengthening demand environment, in our opinion, is enabling tsm to increase wafer prices across most nodes, though the sustainability of wafer price increase into 2022 and beyond is not clear,"" noted hosseini.  consensus among analysts on wall street is a hold based on 1 buy, 2 hold, and 1 sell ratings.  the average analyst price target of $83 implies a 29. 28% downside potential from the current price.  tsm scores a ""perfect 10"" on tipranks' smart score rating system, suggesting the stock is likely to outperform the market.  related news: verizon partners with aifi to enable seamless shopping at indy 500 bank of nova scotia earnings preview: here's what to expect airbnb: a category leader poised for long-term growth more recent articles from smarter analyst: encompass health to redeem $100m worth of 5. 125% senior notes bank of nova scotia earnings preview: here's what to expect hibb tops q1 estimates, raises fy22 guidance boeing shares down 1. 5% on 787 dreamliners delivery delays – reportthe stock market got off to a mixed start to the new month.  after the memorial day holiday, investors initially seemed ready to continue the bull market, but gains quickly evaporated.  by the close of trading, the dow jones industrial average (djindices: ^dji) managed to hold on to a slight advance, but the s&p 500 (snpindex: ^gspc) and nasdaq composite (nasdaqindex: ^ixic) eased lower. all asset classes.  industry-leading prices.  user-friendly investing online. the ""race for space"" sent u. k.  house prices soaring to their highest level in nearly seven years in may, as the covid-19 pandemic encouraged people to move to larger properties in rural areas.

2021-06-02,COVID vaccination guidelines eased for pregnant women.,"singapore — covid-19 vaccination guidelines in singapore have been eased for pregnant women, breastfeeding women, cancer patients currently receiving treatment, and persons who have previously suffered severe skin allergy reactions to medications.  the expert committee on covid-19 vaccination (ec19v) has been monitoring evidence and developments around the world and has revised its guidelines accordingly, the multi-ministry taskforce (mtf) on the pandemic said at a virtual press briefing on monday (31 may). there was no evidence to suggest that the pfizer-biontech or moderna covid-19 vaccines may cause harm to pregnant women or their babies, the mtf stated. however, the committee noted that the amount of data collected on the population segment was still much smaller compared to data on the general population. it advised pregnant women to discuss the risks and benefits with their doctors to make an informed decision on the vaccination.  pregnant women will be able to register and book a vaccination appointment from 4 june, if they are part of the population group eligible for vaccination. similarly, the two vaccines have been deemed to be safe for breastfeeding women and there is no need to stop breastfeeding while receiving the jabs, the ec19v said.  cancer patients on active cancer treatment remain at an increased risk of complications from covid-19 but there was no evidence of any safety signals or increased rates of adverse events from mrna-based covid-19 vaccines, noted the authorities. director of medical services kenneth mak noted that moh had previously exercised ""considerable caution"" and advised that these patients complete their treatment before getting vaccinated.  ""at this time, we prefer for these patients to be vaccinated in a hospital setting where they can be better monitored for their health status.  and we will review later whether these conditions can be revised. ""persons with severe cutaneous adverse reactions (scar), or sever skin allergy reactions to medications, can also receive both vaccines, even though they were previously not recommended to do so.  scar includes stevens-johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, and drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome. ""these are very severe reactions that occur as a result of taking various types of medications,"" explained prof mak.  ""and if you have previously had such a severe allergic reaction to medications like antibiotics, you will now be eligible to receive your covid-19 vaccination. ""the ec19v is also reviewing safety data on persons with a history of anaphylaxis, to allow more to be safely vaccinated, it added.  the committee said it intends to complete the review in the next two weeks, and will set out guidelines allowing certain persons who have had previous history of anaphylaxis to be vaccinated using mrna vaccines safely. prof mak said, ""we hope that these adjustments to our guidance will offer vaccination opportunities for more people and allow them to benefit from the enhanced immune protection that vaccination offers.

""the 25-member crew have completed their quarantine and we are able to question them today,"" a police spokesman said. detectives interviewed the vessel's skipper and chief engineer – both russians – and its chief officer, an indian, at a hotel where they have been quarantined, police said. mepa said the captain of the vessel had known about a nitric acid leak on may 11, long before the vessel entered sri lankan waters. ""we have questioned three members of the crew so far and the investigations are ongoing,"" a police spokesman added. ""select seafarers have today been helping local police with their enquiries into the fire and are cooperating with investigators,"" the vessel's operators, x-press feeders, added in a statement. ""we will respect this process and not publicly discuss operational details until the investigation has been completed. "" the intense flames destroyed much of the cargo, some of which fell into the indian ocean. the authorities are moving to sue the owners of the vessel and its crew and claim damages from insurers. the fire has been under control since sunday, officials said, adding, however, that the vessel continued to smoke on monday and that high monsoon winds were fanning flames at the back of the ship. they said it was still too hot for them to attempt boarding the stricken ship. international salvage firm smit is leading efforts to douse the flames and is being assisted by sri lanka's navy and the indian coast guard. the three-month-old ship was heading to colombo from gujarat, india. it had previously visited qatar and dubai and was due to go to malaysia and singapore after calling at colombo. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-06-02,Canada faces reckoning after remains of indigenous students found.,"keep up to speed at a glance with the top 10 daily storiesthe discovery of the remains of 215 children at one of several boarding schools set up a century ago to forcibly assimilate canada's indigenous peoples has once again compelled the nation to confront its painful past. the grim find at the kamloops indian residential school in western british columbia province offered a stark reminder of the widespread discrimination experienced by the country's indigenous people -- and the particular tragedy of the schools. in 2015, a truth and reconciliation commission (trc) report said canada's assimilation policy pursued until the latter half of the 20th century -- including atrocities at the schools -- amounted to ""cultural genocide. ""that led to a renewed push to atone for canada's past behavior, and prime minister justin trudeau has made reconciliation with the country's 600 tribes a priority for his government, but not everyone is convinced progress is imminent. ""for many first nations, metis or inuit communities in canada, several generations of their families attended the schools and the trauma affiliated with (them) is still very present,"" tricia logan, head of the residential school history and dialogue centre at the university of british columbia, told afp. ""it's hard to say if canada is willing or able to face the truth,"" logan said, noting that some people still ""deny that what happened at the schools was negligent or abusive. ""about 150,000 indian, inuit and metis youngsters in total were enrolled in these schools.  at least 4,100 died, according to the trc report. ""we all have a role to play in dismantling systemic inequalities and discrimination -- it starts with acknowledging the truth about these past wrongs,"" trudeau said tuesday. 'devastating' -in 2008, the government in ottawa issued a formal apology as part of a can$1. 9 billion (us$1. 5 billion) settlement with former students at the residential schools, which were run by the government and the catholic church. then in 2015, the trc report called for major changes to school curricula, among its 94 recommendations, to highlight the history and lingering impacts of the residential schools program. logan said the public response to that report was mostly ""empathetic and supportive,"" but some remarks were also ""very racist or harmful. ""few spoke out about their experiences at the 139 schools until the last one closed in saskatchewan province in 1996. the tk'emlups te secwepemc tribe said last week it had used ground-penetrating radar to confirm the remains of the 215 students who attended the kamloops indian residential school -- far more than the 50 deaths officially on record. it was the largest of canada's boarding schools for indigenous youth, with up to 500 students attending at any one time. attendance was compulsory, and generations of children were separated from their families, logan said.  after decades under church administration, the government took it over, finally closing its doors in 1978. the discovery of the unmarked graves in kamloops has for many former students been ""devastating,"" logan said. ""i do not think the news came as a surprise to survivors and their families, but learning new truths about the schools compounds existing trauma that (they) carry all the time,"" she explained. it also ""reminds survivors about their time and the considerable losses they experienced at the schools,"" she said. abuse, disease, malnutrition -logan, who is credited with decades of research on the residential schools, said they had ""notoriously high rates of physical and sexual abuse, disease, malnutrition and neglect that all contributed to high death rates. ""underfunded and under-equipped, they became breeding grounds for tuberculosis, influenza and pneumonia. former students told of being served scraps and culturally unsuitable foods, brutal punishments meted out by teachers, rapes and sexual violence, and other abuses. they were also prohibited from speaking their native languages or practicing their customs, effectively ""killing the indian in them,"" according to the trc report. today, those experiences are blamed for a high incidence of poverty, alcoholism and domestic violence, as well as high suicide rates, in canada's indigenous communities. the trc noted that parents' requests to have their sons or daughters' remains returned home were rejected at the time by the government as too costly. now, most of the school cemeteries where they are interred have been abandoned. 'much more to do' -after the kamloops revelation, more excavations of school burial sites are now being planned across canada.  trudeau has promised ""concrete actions. ""for logan, ""the work is enormous and there is much more to do.

2021-06-02,"Thai museum unveils 1,000-year-old artefacts returned from US.","bangkok: two ancient sandstone artefacts believed to have been stolen from thailand during the vietnam war were unveiled on monday (may 31) at a bangkok museum, greeted with a fanfare of traditional dancers and an elaborate worship ceremony. the temple support beams which were returned on friday boast exquisite carvings of the hindu deities indra and yama that date back to the late 10th or 11th century. they had been on display for decades at the san francisco asian art museum, and their repatriation to thailand followed a yearslong investigation by the us department of homeland security. on monday, museum staff carefully unpacked the artefacts under the watchful gaze of culture minister itthiphol khunpluem as thai traditional music played. ""these two lintels are evidence of our rich and prosperous history dating back many centuries ago,"" he said, thanking us authorities and the thai foreign affairs ministry for the ""relentless pursuit of the sandstones"". itthiphol also said the government is still deliberating whether they would be taken to smaller, local museums in the provinces of buriram and sa kaeo, which border neighbouring cambodia. the lintels have features that mirror famed cambodian temples showing the influence and reach of the ancient khmer kingdom and are believed to have been stolen out of thailand between 1958 and 1969. as music blared, thai traditional dancers in gold-flecked dresses donning plastic face shields performed during the unveiling ceremony for the artefacts. massive towers of fruit were also on display around flower wreaths an offering to the gods to protect the lintels. itthiphol said there are still ""13 more buddha statues and engraved artefacts waiting to be repatriated from the us"". the california museum had disputed investigators' allegations that the artefacts were stolen, and insisted it had long planned to return them. us museums are not the only ones to be embroiled in art provenance scandals in recent years. australia has repatriated at least eight looted statues to india since 2014. france has vowed to return items taken from senegal and benin, while the netherlands is moving to repatriate artefacts stolen from its former colonies. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-06-02,"Pope Francis issues sweeping reform of church law, including sex abuse rules.","pope francis on tuesday issued the most extensive revision to catholic church law in four decades.  photograph: filippo monteforte/ap pope francis on tuesday issued the most extensive revision to catholic church law in four decades, insisting that bishops take action against clerics who abuse minors and vulnerable adults, commit fraud or attempt to ordain women. the revision, which has been in the works since 2009, involves all of section six of the church's code of canon law, a seven-book code of about 1,750 articles.  it replaced the code approved by pope john paul ii in 1983 and will take effect on december 8th. the revised section, involving about 90 articles concerning crime and punishment, incorporates many existing changes made to church law by francis and his predecessor benedict xvi. it introduces new categories and clearer, more specific language in an attempt to give bishops less wiggle room. in a separate accompanying document, the pope reminded bishops that they were responsible for following the letter of the law. one aim of the revisions, francis said, was to ""reduce the number of cases in which the imposition of a penalty was left to the discretion of authorities"". archbishop filippo iannone, head of the vatican department that oversaw the project, said there had been ""a climate of excessive slack in the interpretation of penal law"", where some bishops sometimes put mercy before justice. sexual abuse of minors was put under a new section titled ""offences against human life, dignity and liberty"", compared to the previously vague ""crimes against special obligations"". the new section was expanded to include crimes such as ""grooming"" of minors or vulnerable adults for sexual abuse and possessing child pornography. it includes the possible defrocking of clerics who use ""threats or abuse of his authority"", to force someone to have sexual relations. last year, an internal report found that former cardinal theodore mccarrick had abused his authority to force seminarians to sleep with him.  he was defrocked in 2019 on charges of the sexual abuse of minors and adults. according to the new code, lay persons in positions of responsibility in the church and found guilty of sexual abuse of minors or vulnerable adults can be punished by the church as well as by civil authorities. while the church has historically prohibited the ordination of women and the ban has been reaffirmed by popes, the 1983 code says only in another section that priestly ordination was reserved for ""a baptised male"". the revised code specifically warns that both the person who attempts to confer ordination on a woman and the woman herself incur automatic excommunication and that the cleric risks being defrocked. kate mcelwee, executive director of the women's ordination conference, said in a statement that while the position was not surprising, spelling it out in the new code was ""a painful reminder of the vatican's patriarchal machinery and its far-reaching attempts to subordinate women"". reflecting the series of financial scandals that have hit the church in recent decades, other new entries in the code include several on economic crimes, such as embezzlement of church funds or property or grave negligence in their administration.  – reuters subscribe.

""we will know for sure in another week or so.  meanwhile, i count on everyone to keep up our efforts and stay vigilant,"" pm lee added. this means working from home if possible and going out only when necessary, as well as seeing a doctor immediately if unwell even if one has been vaccinated. on may 16, the country tightened covid-19 restrictions to stamp out a worrying surge of cases in the community.  these included capping group sizes for social gatherings to two people down from eight in phase three and prohibiting dining in at all eateries. the measures, implemented after new clusters were detected at places such as tan tock seng hospital and changi airport, are slated to end on june 13. the multi-ministry task force tackling the pandemic, which mr wong co-chairs, has assessed that the current suite of measures put in place since may 16 are adequate, said the ministry of health. health minister ong ye kung, who is also co-chair of the task force, noted that there were 182 covid-19 community cases from may 17 to may 23. this dipped to 136 cases from may 24 to may 30. breaking down the numbers, he said the number of unlinked cases as a proportion of all cases has fallen from 22 per cent in the first week of stricter measures, to 18 per cent in the second week. ""the more we can shift this number away to linked cases or better still, linked and quarantined cases the lesser will be the spread of the disease, and the more we can bring the overall number down and suppress this wave of transmission,"" mr ong said at a press conference after pm lee's speech. one positive sign is that nearly 70 per cent of new cases announced each day are linked to members within households, rather than to others in the community, he added. instances of community transmission are also not linked to ""dramatic movements"" such as parties, but mundane activities such as grocery shopping, he said. apart from the cluster linked to the jem and westgate malls, there have been no other major locations over the past 10 days where the virus has spread significantly, mr ong added. ""so, all in all, we are nudging in the right direction. . .  but this wave of infection is not over, and we must continue to stay alert and vigilant in order to suppress it further. ""mr wong reiterated the need for heightened vigilance. ""as much as there is a chance of us relaxing some of the measures after june 13 if things continue to improve, we must also be mentally prepared that we cannot rule out the possibility of further restrictions down the road if they become necessary,"" he said. mr wong pointed out that there are still unlinked cases every day, each of which could easily be a super spreader. ""we are taking steps to contain the fire and to minimise its spread, but the embers of the fire are still out there, and they can easily spark another major flare-up. ""so the situation is highly fluid, and our assessments are being updated on a daily basis,"" he said. the authorities are studying recent cases to find out if there are common patterns of activity that might suggest new areas of risk. venues where people gather, or where there are consistent breaches of safe management measures, will also be closed, he said. mr wong commended singaporeans for playing their part in the fight.

""there are still some parts of the supply chain for which they need to be stored at minus 70 deg c.

""a country that is divided and violent won't be able to deal with iran or with the economy.  a leadership that incites us against one another harms our ability to deal with the challenges we face,"" mr lapid said. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-06-02,Pope updates canon law to address paedophilia by priests.,"vatican city: pope francis updated the catholic church's criminal code on tuesday (jun 1), adding directives on punishing sexual abuse crimes of minors by priests that have long been sought by activists against paedophilia. revision of the penal sanctions within the code of canon law followed a lengthy process involving input from canonist and criminal law experts and came after repeated complaints by victims of sexual abuse and others that the code's previous wording was outdated and not transparent. the purpose of the revision, wrote francis in introducing the changes, is ""restoration of justice, the reform of the offender, and the repair of scandal"". since becoming pope in 2013, the argentine pontiff has striven to tackle the decades-long sexual abuse scandals involving catholic priests around the globe, although many activists against paedophilia insist much more needs to be done. he convened an unprecedented summit on clerical sex abuse in 2019 while lifting secrecy rules that hindered investigations of abusing priests, among other measures. the new code falls short of explicitly spelling out sexual offences against minors yet refers to offences against the sixth commandment, which prohibits adultery. a priest is to be stripped of his office and punished ""with other just penalties"" if he commits such offences with a minor, the new code says. similarly, a priest who grooms or induces a minor ""to expose himself or herself pornographically or to take part in pornographic exhibitions"" will be similarly punished. need for justiceone aim of the revision, wrote francis, was to reduce the number of penalties left to the discretion of judges, especially in the most serious cases. ""the new text introduces various modifications to the law in force and sanctions some new criminal offences, which respond to the increasingly widespread need in the various communities to see justice and order reestablished that the crime has shattered,"" he wrote. other technical improvements related to ""the right of defence, the statute of limitations for criminal action, a more precise determination of penalties"", added francis. the changes will take effect in december. despite recent measures to root out abuse by priests and increase transparency, some victims say the vatican still has not gone far enough to protect children even in the west, where intense media coverage of paedophile priests has led to greater scrutiny of church practices. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-06-02,Football: Ancelotti returns to Real for second spell as coach.,"madrid: carlo ancelotti returned to real madrid for a second spell as coach on tuesday (jun 1), re-joining the club from everton, after agreeing a three-year deal at the bernabeu. the italian was previously in charge of real between 2013 and 2015, and replaces zinedine zidane, who left the la liga club last month. ""while i have enjoyed being at everton i have been presented with an unexpected opportunity which i believe is the right move for me and my family at this time,"" ancelotti said in a statement on the everton website. ancelotti has one of the most-decorated cvs in world football and won the champions league with real in 2014, helping the spaniards to their fabled 'decima' (10th) european crown, before being sacked 12 months later. the 61-year-old is one of three coaches, along with former liverpool manager bob paisley and zidane, to have won the european cup or champions league on three occasions, having also led ac milan to glory in 2003 and 2007. his honours list includes league titles in four different countries at milan, chelsea, paris st germain and bayern munich over a 26-year managerial career. ""carlo ancelotti will be the new first team coach for the next three seasons,"" a brief real madrid statement read. ancelotti will sign his contract and be presented to the media on wednesday. the move comes following zidane's decision to step down five days after his team were pipped to the la liga title by city rivals atletico madrid. real finished two points behind atletico, were knocked out of the champions league in the semi-finals by eventual winners chelsea and suffered a humiliating copa del rey exit to third division minnows alcoyano during a rare trophy-less season. zidane subsequently hit out at the club in an open letter, saying: ""i'm leaving because i feel the club no longer has the faith in me i need, nor the support to build something in the medium or long term. ""it brought an end to a second spell in charge of the club that was fraught with tension. the end of the frenchman's tenure was surrounded by questions over his reliance on players the wrong side of 30 like luka modric, toni kroos and karim benzema and his willingness to oversee the rebuild the club felt it needed. ancelotti was considered something of a coup when everton announced his appointment on a four-and-a-half year contract in december 2019, and he guided the club to a 12th-place premier league finish in his first season. the italian then oversaw an impressive summer transfer window, signing colombian star james rodriguez from real madrid as well as the likes of allan, abdoulaye doucoure and ben godfrey, and everton started the campaign in superb form, winning their first seven games in all competitions. the toffees remained in european contention throughout the season but a dip in form towards the end of the campaign, when they picked up three wins from their final 12 league games, saw them slide to a disappointing mid-table finish. ""the club will begin the process of appointing a new manager immediately and will provide updates in due course,"" read an everton statement. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

still restricted because they have high levels of covid-19 or new variants of the coronavirus.  the emirates airline website is regularly updated, so before you book it is worth checking for the last-minute changes. at the time of writing, emirates said all passengers who had travelled from or transited through india, bangladesh, pakistan and sri lanka in the last 14 days would not be accepted for travel to dubai, or allowed to transfer through dubai. emirates has suspended flights from india until at least june 30. passenger services from sao paulo in brazil also remain suspended until further notice. the rules are different for uae nationals, golden visa holders and members of diplomatic missions. it might have been a while since you last took a flight, so double check the validity of your travel documents, in particular if you are travelling with children. as a visitor your passport should be valid for a minimum period of six months from the date of entry into the uae. if you're transiting the uae (and not passing through immigration) your passport needs to have a minimum of three months validity from the date of transit. emirates has a useful tool you can use to check your passport requirements. most passport holders are eligible for a visa on arrival at no cost.  however, others may need to apply for a visit visa from dubai immigration before travelling. check your status on the visit dubai website. ﻿think about travel insurance as you book your ticket, so you can be sure you are covered if you fall ill in dubai. airlines such as emirates or etihad airways offer passengers free travel insurance that covers covid-19 treatment, but many do not. global insurers such as axa and major us providers including cat 70 and john hancock, have specific covid-19 packages to cover all eventualities. insurance packages can be found for as little as $25 and cover tens of thousands of dollars worth of treatment. all passengers travelling to dubai from any point of origin, including gcc countries, must hold a negative covid‐19 pcr test certificate for a test taken no more than 72 hours before departure. children aged under 12 and passengers who have a moderate or severe disability are exempt from taking a covid‐19 pcr test. the certificate must be a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) test, and it must come from either a uae government designated laboratory, or a trusted and certified laboratory in your country of origin. other test certificates including antibody tests and home testing kits are not accepted in dubai. travellers must bring an official, printed certificate in english or arabic to check in.  text message and digital certificates are not accepted by emirates check-in staff.  pcr certificates in other languages are only acceptable if they can be validated at the originating station. for passengers arriving from certain countries, the covid‐19 pcr report must include a qr code linked to the original report for verification purposes. these countries are bangladesh, india, islamic republic of pakistan, sudan, lebanon, egypt and ethiopia. furthermore, passengers flying from india, pakistan, nigeria or bangladesh, must get a certificate from one of the labs listed in the designated laboratories to be accepted on the flight.  some passengers arriving in dubai are required to take another covid‐19 pcr test on arrival at dubai international airport. these tests are free of charge, and the result is usually sent via text message to your mobile phone within 24 hours. the list of countries can be found on the emirates website, and includes cyprus, israel, the philippines, russia and turkey. if you take a test at the airport, you must remain in your hotel or residence until you receive the test result. if the test is positive, you will be required to undergo isolation and follow the dubai health authority guidelines. you must also download the covid – dxb smart app, which is available on google play and the apple store, free of charge. once you arrive in dubai you are advised to download the al hosn app, which will warn you if you come into close contact with someone who has tested positive. vaccinated tourists can also use it to prove they have been inoculated in their home country. you can do this by registering the ""unified number"" (uid) listed on your visa. if you do not do this, you can still prove your vaccinated status by showing an electronic certificate on your smartphone. under a month-long trial which started on may 26, vaccinated tourists are allowed to attend live events like concerts and sports events, and weddings of up to 100 people in dubai.  they can also go to certain areas of bars, pubs and nightclubs. paper copies of vaccination certificates will not be accepted. nearly every hotel, restaurant and attraction is now open in dubai, but there are still some covid-19 restrictions designed to prevent the transmission of the virus. masks must be warn at all times, apart from when people are sitting down at a table to eat, or when they are undertaking strenuous exercise. people are required to maintain physical distance of two metres from others, and there are heavy fines of dh3,000 ($816) for those caught not wearing a mask or failing to socially distance. the number of people who can sit at one table is 10 at restaurants and cafes, and four at shisha cafes. parties and weddings held in private homes are capped at 30 guests. passengers leaving dubai only need to do a covid‐19 pcr test if it is mandated by the country they are travelling to, so check the requirements carefully. usually, such tests have to be taken no more than 72 hours before your flight, so make sure you plan ahead. in dubai it is cheap and easy to book a test at an authorised laboratory, and you should receive the test results in 24 hours, but it can take longer. research your travel destination, as the authorities might require a certificate printed out, or for you to download a local tracing app.

""there are still some parts of the supply chain for which they need to be stored at minus 70 deg c. ""he said viral vector vaccines are ""much more robust"", as they are more stable and can be stored at fridge temperatures. they use a harmless, weakened adenovirus ""common"" viruses that cause illnesses like colds to carry genetic instructions into the body to prompt cells to mount an immune response. inactivated virus vaccines like the sinopharm and sinovac vaccines use actual coronaviruses taken from infected patients.  ""they are inactivated through chemical means, and so they are no longer alive and they can't replicate and they can't cause disease,"" said dr soon. the body mounts an immune response to the coronavirus proteins, and this helps a person build up immunity, he explained. joyce teojoin st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

""please stay at home and embrace self-lockdown.  if you need to attend to urgent matters please adhere to all sops.  pray that this lockdown will flatten the curve in time,"" he said in a tweet. thelatest outbreakhas been more severe, partly due to highly transmissible variants. to curb the wave of infections, malaysia began atwo-week national lockdownon tuesday.  mosteconomic sectorsare closed andshopping malls have also been shuttered. supermarkets and other premises dealing in basic necessities are allowed to operate.  only two people from each household are allowed to go out to buy essentials or for medical services, with movement limited to a 10km radius. nearly 900 patients in icumalaysia reported 7,105 new covid-19 cases on tuesday.  the country now has a total of 579,462 cases, of which 80,474 are currently active or infectious. the klang valley accounted for more than a third of the new cases with 2,068 in selangor and 817 in kuala lumpur.  sarawak reported 703 new infections while penang and johor had 400 and 431 new cases respectively. the health ministry also announced 71 more covid-19 fatalities, comprising 69 malaysians and two foreigners aged 27 to 93. malaysia's death toll now stands at 2,867. there are currently a record 872 patients in the intensive care unit (icu), of which 419 require respiratory support. dr noor hisham on saturday said that when active covid-19 cases overwhelm the treatment capacity of hospitals, medical personnel are forced to prioritise icu beds for patients with high recovery potential instead of those with a poor prognosis. the reality is that medical frontliners are faced with this ""difficult choice"", he said. dr noor hisham added that government hospital morgues are at capacity and that the authorities are currently finding it challenging to accommodate the increasing number of fatalities. as a result, corpses are being stored in special containers provided by the forensic medical unit, he said. the health ministry on tuesday also identified 27 new clusters, another record.  the country currently has 668 active clusters. thirteen clusters were at workplaces while three were linked to religious activities.  of the eight community clusters, three in sarawak, kelantan and perak were linked to festive household visiting activities. two other clusters have been linked to education institutions while the remaining cluster was traced to an elderly care centre in kuala lumpur. downloadour appor subscribe to our telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:https://cna. asia/telegramit looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-06-02,Commentary: Sinovac use sparks new spat in politically split Thailand.,"widespread distrust of the prayut government is aggravating sinovac hesitancy in the country, says an analyst. bangkok: thailand is suffering through the third – and the most serious – wave of covid-19 infections that has surged since early april. as of may 27, the total infections since apr 1 topped 112,354, with 785 related deaths.  the more virulent variants first identified in india and south africa have been detected, prompting the prayut chan-o-cha government to speed up the vaccine rollout. astrazeneca and sinovac are the two vaccines currently in use.  the government has secured about 117,000 imported astrazeneca shots, with another 61 million shots in local production. the first batch of these – about 1. 7 million doses – will be distributed by june.  up to 6 million sinovac doses from china have been delivered, making sinovac the most widely deployed vaccine in thailand. however, widespread distrust of the prayut government is aggravating sinovac hesitancy in the country.  public trust in the prayut government is low, and citizens lack confidence in the safety of the vaccines obtained by the government. sinovac has been subject to widespread criticism on a number of grounds. unlike most other covid-19 vaccines in use, sinovac is an inactivated vaccine developed from dead microorganisms.  this means that while the risk of side effects is low, the vaccine may not offer high protection rates against infection. lurking anti-china sentimentat a broader societal level, sinovac being chinese has not helped its acceptance.  china – in the eyes of many thais – is viewed with suspicion and even hostility, and products from china are widely viewed as cheap and lacking quality. sinovac also faces politically motivated problems as thailand under prayut is widely perceived by critics of the prayut government as beholden to china. the 2014 coup complicated thailand's relations with the west.  china, which did not criticise thailand's return to military rule under prayut, appeared to be a more attractive major power ally. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid. the thai economy has since become more reliant on chinese investment and tourism.  bilateral defence ties have strengthened significantly, with arms sales, active military exchanges, and the controversial purchase of chinese submarines. unlike some of its neighbours, thailand has no territorial or maritime rights dispute with china, and this helps stabilise the relationship.  china's pandemic diplomacy further thickened bilateral ties as china donated medical supplies and, more recently, sinovac vaccine doses to the prayut government. china's rising involvement and influence naturally fuels worry and latent anti-china sentiment.  sinophobia is particularly prevalent among young, pro-western and pro-democracy thai internet users who see prayut's government and china's regime as ""birds of the same feather"". conservative supporters of prayut are labelled as identical to chinese nationalists.  anti-china feelings, coupled with the prayut government's reliance on sinovac and slow procurement of more reputed alternatives, have been exploited by opposition parties. earlier this year, phuea thai – the leading opposition party – voiced concern about the safety and transparency of sinovac.  move forward party's spokesperson has engaged in online spats with health minister anutin charnvirakul over the efficacy of sinovac. despite their avowed opposition, opposition parliamentarians have said that they have no choice but to get vaccinated with government-imposed vaccines. heated exchanges over sinovacresistance to sinovac, as to the prayut government, is stronger among young thai netizens. the a-list celebrity chompoo araya recently sparked a fierce online backlash when she announced that she has been injected with sinovac and provided a review of the vaccination process, noting that the ""best vaccine is the one you can get first"". many twitter users were convinced that the review was politically motivated and expressed their disappointment in the star for ""supporting"" the unreliable government and the ""bottom-tier"" vaccine. some users pointed out that chompoo was silent when the police violently clashed with protesters last year and concluded that she is ""against progressive developments"". hardliners fueled the heated exchange by creating a list of celebrities who have spoken out in favour of sinovac.  defenders argued that celebrities – whether they are hired by the government or not – are free to get this jab. the uproar escalated when political figures from the anti-government and pro-establishment camps joined in.  pannika wanich from the dissolved future forward party sarcastically asked whether chompoo's fame is rooted in the support from the government or the public. in contrast, deputy health minister satit pitutach praised chompoo for her decision while seri wongmontha – a media personality actively involved in the protests against the yingluck government that led to the 2014 coup – said that facts had been distorted to discredit the prayut government. the vaccine drama over sinovac is the latest example of thailand's widening and deepening political polarisation.  the prayut government's close ties to china and the growing role of digital media have exacerbated tensions between the so-called authoritarian nationalists and pro-democracy revolutionaries. both sides are losing the willingness to tolerate disagreement.  sadly, there is little room left for people in the middle ground who view politics beyond black and white. tita sanglee is an independent analyst and a business owner based in

2021-06-02,WHO approves China's Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine.,"geneva: the world health organization on tuesday (jun 1) approved the sinovac covid-19 vaccine for emergency use the second chinese jab to receive the who's green light. the un health agency signed off on the beijing-based firm sinovac's two-dose vaccine coronavac, which is already being deployed in several countries around the world. ""i'm happy to announce that the sinovac-coronavac vaccine has been given who emergency use listing after being found to be safe, effective, and quality-assured,"" who chief tedros adhanom ghebreyesus told a press conference. ""the easy storage requirements of coronavac make it very suitable for low-resource settings,"" he added. ""it's now crucial to get these life-saving tools to the people that need them quickly. ""the who said the emergency use listing (eul) gives countries, funders, procuring agencies and communities assurance that the vaccine has met international standards. last month sinopharm became the first chinese vaccine to be approved by the who. the organisation has also given eul status to vaccines being made by pfizer/biontech, moderna, johnson & johnson, and the astrazeneca jab being produced in india, south korea and the eu, which it counts separately. who's listing paves the way for countries worldwide to approve and import a vaccine for distribution quickly, especially those states without an international-standard regulator of their own. it also opens the door for the jabs to enter the covax global vaccine-sharing facility, which aims to provide equitable access to doses around the world, particularly in poorer countries. currently only astrazeneca and some pfizer jabs are flowing through the scheme. ""the world desperately needs multiple covid-19 vaccines to address the huge access inequity across the globe,"" said mariangela simao, the who's assistant director general for access to health products. ""we urge manufacturers to participate in the covax facility, share their know-how and data and contribute to bringing the pandemic under control.

""vaccine efficacy results showed that the vaccine prevented symptomatic disease in 51 percent of those vaccinated and prevented severe covid-19 and hospitalisation in 100 percent of the studied population. ""the sinovac vaccine contains an inactivated form of coronavirus that cannot cause the disease.  it also has a substance that helps strengthen the immune response to the vaccine. when given the shot, the immune system identifies the inactivated virus as foreign and makes antibodies against it, which will then recognise the active virus and defend the body against it. few people aged over 60 took part in the clinical trial of sinovac's jab. however, the who said there should be no upper age limit on the vaccine as there is ""no reason to believe it has a different safety profile"" in older generations. the sinovac jab is already in use in 22 territories around the world, according to an afp count. apart from china, the countries using sinovac include chile, brazil, indonesia, mexico, thailand and turkey. chen xu, china's ambassador in geneva, said coronavac's eul status expanded the number of global tools to fight the pandemic.

2021-06-02,Real Madrid: From the Decima to the 'Moratazo'.,"editions:en/football/real-madridsanti siguero gives his opinionthe youngest will not remember it, because they did not suffer from it, but carlo ancelotti began to make his mark in the history of real madrid in the spring of 1989.  carletto was then a struggling midfielder for arrigo sacchi's ac milan, and he opened the scoring in the greatest mockery suffered by los blancos in the european cup: ac milan's 5-0 win at stadio san siro in the 1988/89 season.  there were other defeats in the history of real madrid, comparable in quantitative terms, but that one was especially cruel because it buried the quinta del buitre, a generation of footballers who skirted the seventh european cup but failed several times, although never in such a way raw like that night in milan. ancelotti beat francisco buyo at the san siro and opened a wound that took a decade to heal, until predrag mijatovic scored past angelo peruzzi at the amsterdam arena in may 1998.  the septima was long overdue, but also the decima: from zinedine zidane's volley in glasgow to sergio ramos' unstoppable header in lisbon.  at the time, ancelotti was on real madrid's bench at the estadio da luz, after coming to the club at the beginning of the season to facilitate the digestion of the intense jose mourinho era.  the portuguese brought real madrid closer to the champions league, but it was the italian who grabbed it by both ears, with a real madrid so different from the current one that it is dizzying to remember.  cristiano ronaldo at his best, a gareth bale who still prioritised the big ball over the golf ball, angel di maria's crosses, xabi alonso's passes, a sergio ramos more aware of football than yucatan, el hormiguero and renewals, with marcelo and isco (the ones who changed the flow of that final in the capital of portugal) initiating the ascent to the peak of their careers.  other times, another football.  another real madrid. that champions league success, preceded by the copa del rey after the derailment of marc bartra against the express train called bale at mestalla, heralded a glorious 14/15 season.  and it could have been one, but luka modric got injured and left real madrid without a compass, with a recently landed toni kroos, with the shock of xabi alonso's escape to bayern munich, with manchester united's blank cheque to di maria, and real madrid lost their way in the fight for laliga santander with two defeats at san mames and camp nou after leading the table for 15 matchdays.  still, it was the european elimination that buried carletto.  a surplus real madrid (that won 3-0 against liverpool at anfield and chicharito's goal to eliminate atletico madrid in the quarter-finals) was defeated by juventus with two goals from alvaro morata, one in turin and the other in madrid, and forever left the doubt of whether real madrid had been able to win five champions league titles in a row, like alfredo di stefano's team, because then zidane's three successful champions league runs arrived. nobody would have said it in 2015, but zidane is now the past and carlo is the future of real madrid.  now the question is to know if his 'soft hand' will serve to stiffen a team and a club that is more ready for a revolution than for good vibes, a positive mood and cigarettes. ©  unidad editorial

2021-06-02,Myanmar military fails to quell protests four months after coup.,"myanmar protesters took to the streets on tuesday (jun 1) in several districts, as fighting between the army and anti-junta militias raged in border areas, four months after the military ousted an elected government in a coup. myanmar's military is still struggling to impose order after arresting aung san suu kyi and senior leaders of her party, sparking nationwide protests and paralysing strikes. in the far south of myanmar, anti-military protesters staged a march in laung lone, a photograph posted by the irrawaddy newspaper on social media showed. meanwhile, in the commercial hub of yangon a group of mainly young protesters rallied in the district of kamayut, photographs posted by the myanmar now news portal showed. ""this is not over yet.  we still have our turn,"" read a sign written on a sheet carried by one protester. demonstrators in urban areas have had to become more nimble to avoid security forces, often using flash mobs or staging small unannounced protests, after larger rallies in the first months after the coup were often met with security forces firing live rounds. decades-old conflicts between the military and ethnic minority armies in border areas have also reignited since the coup.  ethnic militias allied with a shadow civilian government have stepped up attacks on the army, which has responded with heavy weapons and air strikes, forcing thousands to flee. mobile phone footage obtained from a resident in kayah state bordering thailand showed what appeared to be artillery being fired from inside the state capital loikaw into demoso, about 14. 5km away, where a people's defence force said it had attacked troops and was coming under heavy fire. residents in loikaw said that about 50 rounds had been fired on monday and six on tuesday morning. ""the sound of artillery is deafening us,"" a resident told reuters on monday, requesting anonymity due to safety concerns. the karenni nationalities defence force, a militia active in kayah state, said in a post on its facebook page that 80 army soldiers had been killed on monday, while one of its fighters and a civilian were also casualties. reuters could not verify the claim and a spokesman for the junta did not answer calls seeking comment. fighting in kayah has displaced about 37,000 people in recent weeks, according to the united nations.  many have fled into jungles and are in need of food and medicine. civilian forces, often armed with rudimentary rifles and limited training, have been formed in towns and regions across myanmar to challenge the military, in support of a national unity government that the junta says is treasonous. security forces have killed 840 people since the coup, according to figures provided by an activist group. junta chief min aung hlaing has said the toll was nearer 300, and has said it is unlikely there will be a civil war in myanmar. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-06-02,Nadal notches 101st French Open win as tournament reels from Osaka shockwave.,"published :
													2 jun 2021 at 00:45												writer: 
															afp paris: rafael nadal began his bid for a record-setting 21st grand slam title with a straight sets win at the french open on tuesday as the fallout from naomi osaka's revelations over depression and anxiety sent shockwaves through roland garros. nadal, the 13-time champion in paris, defeated 63rd-ranked alexei popyrin of australia 6-3, 6-2, 7-6 (7/3) to take his record at the tournament to 101 wins against just two losses. ""i was lucky to win that third set, i don't know how (i did).  the beginning of the match had been very tough too,"" said nadal, who had been 2-5 down in the third set, saving two set points. ""in these warm and fast conditions it's always very difficult.  he's young and the speed of his ball is very strong. ""up next is fellow 34-year-old richard gasquet. the pair first played one another when they were children.  as professionals, nadal leads 16-0. the spaniard's opening win shifted the emphasis onto world number one, and potential semi-final opponent, novak djokovic who is chasing a second french open title and 19th grand slam. djokovic was taking on 66th-ranked tennys sandgren of the united states in an evening session match-up. world number one ashleigh barty marked her return to paris for the first time since her 2019 title triumph by beating american left-hander bernarda pera 6-4, 3-6, 6-2 but admitted she was fighting a hip problem. barty, 25, skipped the defence of her title in 2020 due to the pandemic but this year has won trophies at the yarra valley classic, miami and on clay in stuttgart in the run-up to roland garros. after easing through the first set on court philippe chatrier, barty went off the boil in the second and called for the trainer at the changeover. ""i'm not going to hide behind the fact i'm not quite 100%,"" said barty whose left thigh was heavily strapped. ""but i can guarantee that i will go out there with the right attitude every day and be really accepting of that and give it a crack no matter what. ""meanwhile, the fallout from osaka's withdrawal continued to be felt. the 23-year-old world number two, and four-time major winner, pulled out on monday after she was fined $15,000 and threatened with disqualification for refusing to attend press conferences. osaka claims traditional post-match media conferences are akin to ""kicking people when they're down"" and were having a detrimental effect on her mental health. she revealed she had been suffering bouts of depression since her 2018 us open title breakthrough as well as anxiety attacks. her decision attracted widespread sympathy and accusations over the role of the media in the affair. ""there's a sense of voyeurism around how it presently works,"" wrote peter terry, a professor of psychology at the university of southern queensland in australia on theconversation. com. ""perhaps some want to see athletes crumble and break down into tears, having put them on a pedestal. ""osaka is a young, introverted, anxious person.  we should by now understand that sports stars are not super human, that they have the same doubts and mental health issues as everyone else. ""ironically, another roland garros press conference led tuesday to the injury-enforced withdrawal of two-time wimbledon champion petra kvitova. the czech 11th seed, a roland garros semi-finalist in 2012 and 2020, had saved a match point in her first-round win over belgian qualifier greet minnen on sunday. ""during my post-match press requirements on sunday i fell and hurt my ankle.  unfortunately, after an mri and much discussion with my team, i have made the tough decision that it would be unwise to play on it,"" said the 31-year-old. fifth seed elina svitolina, a three-time quarter-finalist, recovered from a 2-5 second set deficit to beat french teenager oceane babel 6-2, 7-5. italian 37-year-old andreas seppi, playing in his 63rd successive grand slam, stunned 20th seeded felix auger-aliassime 6-3, 7-6 (10/8), 4-6, 6-4. for seppi, it was a first win at any level this year. venus williams, playing the tournament for the 24th time and a runner-up 19 years ago, saw her 89th grand slam end at the first hurdle as russia's ekaterina alexandrova eased to a 6-3, 6-1 win over the 40-year-old american. health authorities reported 38 new covid-19 fatalities on wednesday and 3,440 new cases, bringing the accumulated toll to 1,107 deaths and the number of cases since the start of the pandemic to 165,462. cross-border trade rose by 26. 7% in the first four months, increasing the government's confidence such trade will grow by 3-6% this year after declining 1. 7% in 2020. the world health organization approved the sinovac covid-19 vaccine for emergency use -- the second chinese jab to receive the who's green light.

2021-06-02,"Aedes mosquito population grows by 30%: Dengue cases in Singapore expected to rise, Singapore News.","singapore dengue cases here are expected to increase, as the population of the aedes aegypti mosquito which transmits dengue and other viruses has grown by about 30 per cent in april, compared with january, said the national environment agency on tuesday (june 1). the mosquito population has remained high in some residential areas across the island, including clementi west street 1, hougang avenue 6, 8 and 10, jurong east street 32, mei chin road, mei ling street, and stirling road. over 2,700 dengue cases have been reported since the start of this year and there are currently 22 active dengue clusters. although there have been fewer dengue cases in recent weeks than in the same period last year when a historic outbreak of dengue occurred in singapore the figures remain higher than those of 2017 and 2018 , years that saw 2,772 and 3,285 cases respectively. there were 35,315 reported dengue cases last year, with 28 deaths. ""as we have now entered the warmer months of the year from june to october, the increased risk of higher dengue transmission is a concern,"" said the agency. the nea therefore expects an increasing number of dengue cases due to the accelerated breeding cycle and maturation of the aedes aegypti mosquito vectors meaning it takes less time for the mosquito to become a biting adult in warmer months as well as the shorter incubation period of the dengue virus. this refers to the time needed for the mosquito to pick up the disease and pass it on. [[nid:495141]]according to the world health organisation, this period is around eight to 12 days when the temperature is 25 to 28 deg c. since the covid-19 phase two (heightened alert) measures kicked in on may 16, the nea said that more people staying in and working from home could mean more "" biting opportunities"" for the day-biting aedes aegypti mosquito, and potentially higher risk of dengue transmission. last august, a study examining the impact of the circuit breaker on the number of dengue infections found there were 50 per cent more cases than usual. the study, which was conducted in collaboration with the national university of singapore's saw swee hock school of public health, also found that adults aged 20 to 64 made up the majority of infections, since that part of the population would have normally been in the workplace during the day. in addition, more than half of the positive dengue samples since february were due to the less common dengue serotypes 3 (denv-3) and 4 (denv-4). serotypes are distinct variations within a particular virus.  there are four dengue serotypes: denv-1, 2, 3 and 4.  the predominant dengue virus serotype in singapore has been denv-2 since 2016. the nea said that since denv-3 has not been dominant for about the last three decades and the incidence rate of denv-4 has also been consistently low, the population immunity for both serotypes is low, making people more likely to get infected. however, it added that it is too early to say that there has been a switch of dominant dengue virus serotype in singapore. [[nid:500003]]the denv-3 serotype has been detected in the dengue cluster at cashew terrace and hazel park terrace, while denv-4 has been detected in clusters at hougang central and pasir ris street 21. ""if left unchecked, the high aedes aegypti mosquito population, coupled with the circulation of previously uncommon dengue virus serotypes and a sizeable proportion of people. . .  working from home, would add to the dengue risk this year,"" said the nea. it urged the public to prevent mosquito breeding by ensuring that stagnant water is removed. in the meantime, the nea will continue to conduct inspections in areas with higher mosquito population, and has stepped up its operations in dengue cluster areas. this article was first published in the straits times.  permission required for reproduction.

entered the warmer months of the year from june to october, the increased risk of higher dengue transmission is a concern,"" said the agency.', 'the nea therefore expects an increasing number of dengue cases due to the accelerated breeding cycle and maturation of the aedes aegypti mosquito vectors meaning it takes less time for the mosquito to become a biting adult in warmer months as well as the shorter incubation period of the dengue virus.', 'this refers to the time needed for the mosquito to pick up the disease and pass it on.', '[[nid:495141]]according to the world health organisation, this period is around eight to 12 days when the temperature is 25 to 28 deg c. since the covid-19 phase two (heightened alert) measures kicked in on may 16, the nea said that more people staying in and working from home could mean more "" biting opportunities"" for the day-biting aedes aegypti mosquito, and potentially higher risk of dengue transmission.', 'last august, a study examining the impact of the circuit breaker on the number of dengue infections found there were 50 per cent more cases than usual.', ""the study, which was conducted in collaboration with the national university of singapore's saw swee hock school of public health, also found that adults aged 20 to 64 made up the majority of infections, since that part of the population would have normally been in the workplace during the day."", 'in addition, more than half of the positive dengue samples since february were due to the less common dengue serotypes 3 (denv-3) and 4 (denv-4).', 'serotypes are distinct variations within a particular virus.', 'there are four dengue serotypes: denv-1, 2, 3 and 4.  the predominant dengue virus serotype in singapore has been denv-2 since 2016. the nea said that since denv-3 has not been dominant for about the last three decades and the incidence rate of denv-4 has also been consistently low, the population immunity for both serotypes is low, making people more likely to get infected.', 'however, it added that it is too early to say that there has been a switch of dominant dengue virus serotype in singapore.', '[[nid:500003]]the denv-3 serotype has been detected in the dengue cluster at cashew terrace and hazel park terrace, while denv-4 has been detected in clusters at hougang central and pasir ris street 21.', '""if left unchecked, the high aedes aegypti mosquito population, coupled with the circulation of previously uncommon dengue virus serotypes and a sizeable proportion of people.', '.', '.', 'working from home, would add to the dengue risk this year,"" said the nea.', 'it urged the public to prevent mosquito breeding by ensuring that stagnant water is removed.', 'in the meantime, the nea will continue to conduct inspections in areas with higher mosquito population, and has stepped up its operations in dengue cluster areas.', 'this article was first published in the straits times.', 'permission required for

2021-06-02,"Covid-19 scare, quarantine for family of 12 after maid's early SHN discharge, Singapore News.","singapore when a hotel worker hired a new maid to care for her elderly parents, she did not think it would lead to a covid-19 scare and quarantine for her family of 12. the indonesian maid, who arrived here on april 15, was discharged from stay-home notice (shn) only five days later, despite testing positive for her polymerase chain reaction (pcr) test. the employer, who wanted to be known only as ms lee, 32, was worried if the maid's early discharge was safe, so she checked with the isolation facility where the helper was quarantined. she was told not to worry because the helper's serology test came back positive, indicating that it was a past infection. her worst fears came true when the maid was retested and the results were positive an issue that came to light last week when former dj jade rasif said in a social media post that she had a similar experience. [[nid:529338]]in ms lee's case, the helper arrived on april 21 at her home, where ms lee lives with her two elderly parents and her brother. two weeks later on may 4, the helper tested positive in a mandatory swab test.  an ambulance took her to the national centre for infectious diseases (ncid). she was among several maids who had been released early from shn, only to test positive again a few weeks later.  since feb 5, maids and confinement nannies coming into singapore have had to do compulsory serology tests in addition to pcr tests. also read: covid-19: quarantine order vs stay-home notice vs leave of absence here's what each mean for employees and their bossesthose who test positive for antibodies in their serology test are classified as recovered patients and can be released from shn. however, some of these maids were called back for swab tests over the past month, according to several maid agencies the straits times spoke to.  some then tested positive and were put in isolation. on may 16, ms rasif said in facebook and instagram posts that her helper tested positive for covid-19 after being released early from shn.  the manpower ministry (mom) has since clarified that the helper was not infectious and was shedding dead viral fragments. mr steve siva, director of maid agency unistarr employment, said the issue has raised concerns among employers and maids.  he said: ""we didn't expect domestic workers could still be potential covid-19 cases as our understanding was that they were cleared. employers also have suffered.  ms lee's troubles began when her helper was first taken to ncid on may 4.  ""it was a shock, and it sent us all into confusion and panic because we didn't know what would happen, whether we needed to be quarantined.  nobody told us anything,"" she said. her two sisters and their families of four had also come into contact with the helper when they visited for a family dinner.  all of them decided to self-quarantine. [[nid:530076]]the next day, ms lee received an e-mail that informed her that the helper was a suspected positive covid-19 case, but she and her family could continue their daily activities.  the helper then tested negative twice in a row. on may 8, after the maid was swabbed again, moh called ms lee to inform her that all 12 of them had to be under quarantine. ms lee said: ""we were speechless at this point.  we thought it was safe to go about our daily lives, and had met so many people at work and school. . .  we were also worried for the safety of our parents, who have chronic illnesses. ""ms lee and her family have finished their quarantine and cleared all their swab tests, but the maid's status remains unclear. she was discharged last tuesday after completing 21 days of isolation, with a memo that said she was no longer infectious.  however, ms lee said when she spoke to an moh doctor on may 21, she was told it was still unclear if the maid had been reinfected. she said: ""it's making us very jittery. . .  she went through multiple swab and blood tests, and we just find it unbelievable that there isn't anything on her infection status. ""[[nid:495878]]another employer, rachel (not her real name), 55, said the maid she employs was taken away on may 2 after testing positive for covid-19 not knowing whether her family was safe and when the maid could return. she earlier got a call from the authorities and was told the maid had tested positive but that rachel and her family were not under quarantine. rachel, who did not want to be named to avoid causing alarm at the daycare facility her father visits, said: ""i was so frightened and sceptical because it was just over the phone.
