""the annexation plan was eventually scrapped when israel formalised ties with the united arab emirates. after israel held its fourth election in two years in march, mr bennett, who leads the far-right yamina party, said a fifth vote would be a national calamity and entered talks with the centre-left block that forms the main opposition to mr netanyahu. an advocate of liberalising the economy, mr bennett has voiced support for cutting government red tape and taxes.  but he is comparatively liberal on issues such as gay rights and the relationship between religion and the state. reuters, agence france-pressejoin st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-06-01,Singapore to use DIY Covid-19 antigen test kits at construction sites.,"
                    tuesday, 01 jun 2021
                singapore, june 1 (the straits times/ann): to further reduce the risk of transmission at worksites, the use of antigen rapid tests (art) will now be piloted at construction worksites for those who are not living in dormitories. these tests, which will generally be conducted once every three days, will be administered by workers through do-it-yourself covid-19 test kits, the building and construction authority (bca) said on monday (may 31). this comes on top of the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) rostered routine testing that these workers continue to be required to take. currently, all individuals at construction worksites, whether vaccinated or not, must be tested once every seven days or once every 14 days, depending on their risk level, such as whether they stay in dormitories. in a circular, the bca said that each employer will appoint trained personnel as supervisors to ensure proper infection prevention controls and the correct use of the test kits. some worksites will also designate and train specific personnel who administer the swabs for their colleagues, the bca added. the move to pilot such self-administered tests at worksites comes after prime minister lee hsien loong's announcement on monday that do-it-yourself covid-19 test kits will soon be available at pharmacies here. these tests, which are simple to use, can be administered by front-line workers on their own, if they wish to test themselves frequently or even daily, pm lee said. pcr tests are the most accurate, but usually take a day or two for results to be known.  the less accurate art returns results in about 30 minutes and is used heavily for pre-event testing. the pilot use of such art at worksites is being overseen by the bca, the ministry of health (moh) and the ministry of manpower (mom). in its circular, the bca said it is currently engaging worksites on the pilot initiative, and that more worksites will be progressively included as singapore ramps up its supply of antigen rapid tests. more details on the requirements and implementation of the tests will be provided when they are ready, including the necessary training and preparation required, the bca added. moh said on monday that it will be extending the use of arts further, with pilots in student hostels in autonomous universities.  it will also work with capitaland to run pilots at one or two selected malls for tenants and people who work there. those whose rapid test returns a positive result will need to take a pcr test at a swab and send home public health preparedness clinic or regional screening centre to confirm if they have covid-19.  they are required to self-isolate until they receive a negative pcr test result.

2021-06-01,Civil engineering contractor fined for damaging water main; causing loss of 1.8 million litres of water.,"singapore: a civil engineering company has been fined s$41,500 for damaging a potable water main, which caused 1. 8 million litres of water to be lost, said pub on tuesday (jun 1). tong shing contractors was also penalised for carrying out works within a water pipe corridor without pub's prior approval, said the national water agency in a press release. this is the company's first conviction and the fine was meted out on may 18. the contractor was carrying out pipe jacking works across admiralty road west on dec 22, 2018 as part of road-widening and infrastructure works. according to pub, the head of the pipe-jacking machine struck a water main with a diameter of 700mm at a depth of about 3. 7m below the road surface and punctured it. ""the leak resulted in the loss of 1. 8 million litres of potable water, enough to fill about two-thirds of an olympic-sized swimming pool,"" said the agency. ""as a result of the incident, three traffic lanes at admiralty road west near the junction of dahan road were also affected. ""after being alerted to the incident, the agency isolated the leak and carried out repair works, ""which uncovered a hole of about 300mm on the water main"". ""investigations revealed that tong shing did not carry out adequate site verification works to physically ascertain the exact location and alignment of the affected water main before commencement of works,"" pub added. tong shing also proceeded with pipe jacking works without submitting a plan for pub's approval as required and ""failed to take all reasonable precautions to minimise the risk of damage"", the agency said. pub said it takes ""a serious view"" of water main damage resulting in wastage, which can be prevented with ""due diligence"". ""contractors should always refer to pub's advisory on the prevention of damage to water pipe infrastructure before carrying out any construction works.  they must exercise caution when carrying out works near water mains and ensure that adequate measures are in place to prevent damage. ""under the public utilities act, the penalty for damaging a water main or connecting pipe with a diameter of 300mm or more is a fine of up to s$200,000, up to three years in jail or both. contractors who carry out works in the vicinity of water mains without an approved plan may be fined up to s$10,000. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-06-01,"Without a Nuclear Deal, How Close Is Iran to a Bomb?.","three years after former president donald trump withdrew the u. s.  from a landmark nuclear agreement with iran, tehran's government is closer to having the material needed for a nuclear weapon than if the deal had remained in place.  iranians have enriched more uranium to higher levels using more sophisticated technologies than they would otherwise have had access to under a strict monitoring regime.  those developments have led president joe biden's administration to join diplomats from europe, china and russia in seeking to revive the 2015 agreement, which reined in tehran's atomic program in exchange for relief from economic sanctions. 1.  how close is iran to making a bomb?iran has accumulated enough enriched uranium (meaning it has an increased concentration of the isotope uranium-235) to construct several bombs should its leaders choose to purify the heavy metal to the 90% level typically used in weapons.  by producing 2. 4 kilograms (5. 3 pounds) of highly enriched uranium, purified to levels of 60%, the nation demonstrated that its engineers could quickly move to weapons-grade.  international atomic energy agency inspectors report iran has stockpiled more than 3,000 kilograms of low-enriched uranium, which typically has 3%-5% concentration of u-235, as well as 63 kilograms of the material enriched to 20% purity. 2.  why is enrichment so important?obtaining the material necessary to induce atomic fission is the most difficult step in the process of making nuclear power or bombs.  countries need to develop an industrial infrastructure to produce uranium-235 isotopes, which comprise less than 1% of matter in uranium ore but are key to sustaining a fission chain reaction.  thousands of centrifuges spinning at supersonic speeds are used to separate the material.  the iaea keeps track of gram-level changes in uranium inventories worldwide to ensure the material isn't being diverted for weapons.  whether or not iran retains the right to enrich uranium has been at the heart of its nuclear conflict with the u. s.  for two decades. 3.  did the 2015 deal slow iran's progress?yes.  the deal was written to ensure that even if it was someday broken, iran would need at least a year to restore weaponization capacity.  iran forfeited some 97% of its enriched uranium and mothballed three-quarters of the industrial capacity needed to refine the heavy metal.  before the accord, iran had enough to potentially build more than a dozen bombs.  iran always maintained it was pursuing nuclear energy, not nuclear weapons, but world powers doubted that claim. 4.  why did iran break its part of the agreement?president hassan rouhani waited a year after the trump administration reimposed sanctions before giving the orders to break the nuclear covenants set out by the accord.  over the last 18 months, iran has shown it could steadily lift its atomic capacity despite the best efforts of saboteurs and assassins to derail the program. 5.  can the deal be revived?biden promised during his presidential campaign that if iran returned to compliance with its obligations under the 2015 deal, the u. s.  would also return to the deal and lift sanctions.  diplomats bunkered down in vienna have conducted intensive talks over two months to revive the accord.  as of the beginning of june, they'd made substantial progress and were close to reinstituting the safeguards needed to ensure iran can't construct a weapon.  iran says it wants to repair the deal before president hassan rouhani leaves office in august.  the country's june 18 election is expected to favor political hardliners who are more hostile to the u. s.  and the nuclear agreement. 6.  what happens if the agreement is revived?to return to compliance with the deal's limits, iran would have to dramatically reduce uranium stockpiles and sideline much of its enrichment technology.  international inspectors would again have full access to places where nuclear material is produced, an important consideration as monitors continue parsing information about the country's alleged historical weapons-related activities.  iran would win reprieve from sanctions that hamstrung its exports of oil and other economic activities.  while some of the nuclear limitations in the deal begin to expire in 2025, diplomats expect follow-on talks to take place that would focus on regional security and iran's production of ballistic missiles. 7.  what happens if there's no deal?after entering the original deal in 2015, then-president barack obama said the alternative might have been a military conflict with major disruptions to the global economy.  over the last three years, the dispute between washington and tehran has roiled the wider middle east, fueling conflicts where iran and american allies are on opposing sides, with iran blamed for attacks on shipping in key waterways. more

""this paves the way for other issuers and clients to tap on ddex's capabilities to efficiently access capital markets for their funding needs and sets the stage for more sto issuances and listings on dde as asset tokenization turns mainstream. ""as the main underwriter for these digital bonds, dbs bank has structured the bond with a six-month expiration or 'tenor', and 0. 6% coupon-rate per annum. in an effort to attract as a broad an investor market as possible dbs bank notes that the bond will be sold in lots 1/25th the size normally seen.   the ability to do so is a key attribute made possible through the use of blockchain technology like digital securities. as the digital bond on offer is indeed a security, the offering must adhere to existing regulatory framework – meaning that access is currently restricted to accredited investors. upon announcing news of its digital bond, eng-kwok seat moey, group head of capital markets at dbs, stated,""our maiden sto listing on the dbs digital exchange is a significant milestone, as it highlights the strength of our digital asset ecosystem in facilitating new ways of unlocking value for issuers and investors.  we expect asset tokenisation to increasingly become more mainstream as more of our clients start to embrace security token issuance as part of their capital fund raising exercise which we believe will boost singapore's ambitions to be a digital asset hub in asia. ""news of dbs bank hosting a digital securities offering should not come as a major surprise.   months ago documentation from the outfit was leaked online, indicating forthcoming plans to begin servicing the digital assets sector in a big way.   while the dbs bank documentation has long been removed, we have seen the launch of ddex, dbs digital custody, and now its inaugural dso in the time

2021-06-01,3 primary schools in Punggol start tapping on solar power as part of carbon-neutral push.,"singapore: three primary schools in punggol have begun tapping on electricity generated from solar panels as singapore moves towards its target for at least 20 per cent of schools to be carbon-neutral by 2030. rooftop solar systems were installed at horizon primary school, compassvale primary school and edgefield primary school at the end of april, said sunseap group on tuesday (jun 1). the systems will generate 397. 44 kilowatts peak (kwp), 190. 44 kwp and 389. 16 kwp of energy respectively – enough to power 297 four-room flats when combined, said the local solar energy solutions provider. sunseap said it was also installing solar panels at six other schools: anderson primary school, kranji secondary school, catholic high school (primary), methodist girls' school (primary and secondary) and tampines primary school. earlier this year, the ministry of education (moe) said progressively equipping schools with solar panels was one way it planned to reach the 2030 carbon-neutral target. the target was first announced in february with the launch of thesingapore green plan. moe also said it was working towards a two-thirds reduction of net carbon emissions from the schools sector by 2030. as of march, about 130 schools were on the solarnova programme with solar panels progressively installed on their rooftops. then minister for education lawrence wong told parliament that moe will extend the programme to cover most of the remaining schools in the coming decade. the school installations carried out by sunseap were part of the fourth solar leasing tender awarded to the company under the solarnova programme in 2019.  the company said it is set to install more than 170,000 solar panels across public housing blocks and government sites between 2020 and 2022.

2021-06-01,Myanmar military fails to quell protests four months after coup.,"myanmar protesters took to the streets on tuesday (jun 1) in several districts, as fighting between the army and anti-junta militias raged in border areas, four months after the military ousted an elected government in a coup. myanmar's military is still struggling to impose order after arresting aung san suu kyi and senior leaders of her party, sparking nationwide protests and paralysing strikes. in the far south of myanmar, anti-military protesters staged a march in laung lone, a photograph posted by the irrawaddy newspaper on social media showed. meanwhile, in the commercial hub of yangon a group of mainly young protesters rallied in the district of kamayut, photographs posted by the myanmar now news portal showed. ""this is not over yet.  we still have our turn,"" read a sign written on a sheet carried by one protester. demonstrators in urban areas have had to become more nimble to avoid security forces, often using flash mobs or staging small unannounced protests, after larger rallies in the first months after the coup were often met with security forces firing live rounds. decades-old conflicts between the military and ethnic minority armies in border areas have also reignited since the coup.  ethnic militias allied with a shadow civilian government have stepped up attacks on the army, which has responded with heavy weapons and air strikes, forcing thousands to flee. mobile phone footage obtained from a resident in kayah state bordering thailand showed what appeared to be artillery being fired from inside the state capital loikaw into demoso, about 14. 5km away, where a people's defence force said it had attacked troops and was coming under heavy fire. residents in loikaw said that about 50 rounds had been fired on monday and six on tuesday morning. ""the sound of artillery is deafening us,"" a resident told reuters on monday, requesting anonymity due to safety concerns. the karenni nationalities defence force, a militia active in kayah state, said in a post on its facebook page that 80 army soldiers had been killed on monday, while one of its fighters and a civilian were also casualties. reuters could not verify the claim and a spokesman for the junta did not answer calls seeking comment. fighting in kayah has displaced about 37,000 people in recent weeks, according to the united nations.  many have fled into jungles and are in need of food and medicine. civilian forces, often armed with rudimentary rifles and limited training, have been formed in towns and regions across myanmar to challenge the military, in support of a national unity government that the junta says is treasonous. security forces have killed 840 people since the coup, according to figures provided by an activist group. junta chief min aung hlaing has said the toll was nearer 300, and has said it is unlikely there will be a civil war in myanmar. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

                there has been no engagement between national covid-19 immunisation programme coordinating minister khairy jamaluddin and the private general practitioners (gps) on the involvement of private gps in the national immunisation programme's (nip) phase 2 and 3.  the malaysian medical association (mma) had officially written to the minister on march 2 to meet on plans for private gps to be involved in the nip but there had been no reply from yb's office.  no official communication from the jkjav even up until now.  the minister had shown no interest in engaging the gps. why are there only 2,500 gps registered for the nip?the minister should have come down from his high horse to meet with us months ago when we wrote to him.  perhaps that would have encouraged more gps to get on board.  what a difference it would have made if he showed some interest. the nip coordinating minister has a zoom session with the media every other day.  why hasn't he had a zoom session with the 8,000 gps in the country? perhaps that could have made all the difference. only now when cases of covid-19 and deaths have skyrocketed, there is talk of gps.  where was moh and jkjav months ago? or are we keeping to tradition in waiting for things to get worse before something is done?by the end of april, most of the 2,500 private gps had already received training and were ready to begin vaccinating in early may the timeline targeted to begin the programme, but it was left hanging.  the gps have been waiting for the go-ahead from the government.  was the nip coordinating minister aware of this? if he was, why the delay?even with 2,500 gps, 75,000 vaccinations could be carried out per day.  i am sure the minister is well aware of this as it has been widely publicised.  if he is indeed aware, then as the minister in charge of the nip, he should be bugging the gps night and day if the programme was not moving along, knowing they are the best, easiest option, and most readily available resource to carry out vaccinations as proven in other countries.  and by the way, all private gps were trained by the health ministry of malaysia. every day, the minister is getting bombarded with questions on the slow progress of the nip.  shouldn't he be engaging the private gps, who can instantly double or triple the vaccination rate?for months, there have been calls for private healthcare participation in the nip, but the government has been dragging their feet.  a good leader is one who has his finger on the pulse of the rakyat and understands their needs.  as can clearly be seen now, many members of the public prefer to go to their good ol' private gp down the road to get their jabs.  as a minister serving the people, he should do all he can to make that happen as quickly as possible. one of the main reasons why the government of the day, after 3 mcos, has failed to bring the covid-19 situation under control is its failure to listen.  there is a lot of talk from them, but no listening.  policies are decided in silos, with hardly any engagement with stakeholders.  this has been the story since day one of the pandemic. how can there be any hope of success in managing the pandemic when the government is keeping to themselves and even turning away help? in this case, private gps have not been consulted even when the vaccination programme involves them!lastly, on the training required for vaccinations, it is mostly on cold chain requirements for the vaccine storage and on administrative procedures.  nothing really technical or scientific.  the training is done online and it takes only 2-3 hours to complete.  even using the ""special"" syringe is not complicated.  they should trust the doctor to know how to handle one. if at all, the minister is aware that there is too much red tape in the way of the programme with private clinics, then as the nip coordinating minister, he should do something about it.  we only want things to work because like the minister as well as all malaysians, we too, want the nip to be a great success so that the country can recover from this nightmare of a pandemic as quickly as possible. prof datuk dr subramaniam muniandy, presidentmalaysian medical association related stories:only about 2,500 gps signed up to be part of covid-19 vaccination process, says khairygp clinics to be roped in for jabs

2021-06-01,"Covid-19 scare, quarantine for family of 12 after maid's early SHN discharge, Singapore News.","singapore when a hotel worker hired a new maid to care for her elderly parents, she did not think it would lead to a covid-19 scare and quarantine for her family of 12. the indonesian maid, who arrived here on april 15, was discharged from stay-home notice (shn) only five days later, despite testing positive for her polymerase chain reaction (pcr) test. the employer, who wanted to be known only as ms lee, 32, was worried if the maid's early discharge was safe, so she checked with the isolation facility where the helper was quarantined. she was told not to worry because the helper's serology test came back positive, indicating that it was a past infection. her worst fears came true when the maid was retested and the results were positive an issue that came to light last week when former dj jade rasif said in a social media post that she had a similar experience. [[nid:529338]]in ms lee's case, the helper arrived on april 21 at her home, where ms lee lives with her two elderly parents and her brother. two weeks later on may 4, the helper tested positive in a mandatory swab test.  an ambulance took her to the national centre for infectious diseases (ncid). she was among several maids who had been released early from shn, only to test positive again a few weeks later.  since feb 5, maids and confinement nannies coming into singapore have had to do compulsory serology tests in addition to pcr tests. also read: covid-19: quarantine order vs stay-home notice vs leave of absence here's what each mean for employees and their bossesthose who test positive for antibodies in their serology test are classified as recovered patients and can be released from shn. however, some of these maids were called back for swab tests over the past month, according to several maid agencies the straits times spoke to.  some then tested positive and were put in isolation. on may 16, ms rasif said in facebook and instagram posts that her helper tested positive for covid-19 after being released early from shn.  the manpower ministry (mom) has since clarified that the helper was not infectious and was shedding dead viral fragments. mr steve siva, director of maid agency unistarr employment, said the issue has raised concerns among employers and maids.  he said: ""we didn't expect domestic workers could still be potential covid-19 cases as our understanding was that they were cleared. employers also have suffered.  ms lee's troubles began when her helper was first taken to ncid on may 4.  ""it was a shock, and it sent us all into confusion and panic because we didn't know what would happen, whether we needed to be quarantined.  nobody told us anything,"" she said. her two sisters and their families of four had also come into contact with the helper when they visited for a family dinner.  all of them decided to self-quarantine. [[nid:530076]]the next day, ms lee received an e-mail that informed her that the helper was a suspected positive covid-19 case, but she and her family could continue their daily activities.  the helper then tested negative twice in a row. on may 8, after the maid was swabbed again, moh called ms lee to inform her that all 12 of them had to be under quarantine. ms lee said: ""we were speechless at this point.  we thought it was safe to go about our daily lives, and had met so many people at work and school. . .  we were also worried for the safety of our parents, who have chronic illnesses. ""ms lee and her family have finished their quarantine and cleared all their swab tests, but the maid's status remains unclear. she was discharged last tuesday after completing 21 days of isolation, with a memo that said she was no longer infectious.  however, ms lee said when she spoke to an moh doctor on may 21, she was told it was still unclear if the maid had been reinfected. she said: ""it's making us very jittery. . .  she went through multiple swab and blood tests, and we just find it unbelievable that there isn't anything on her infection status. ""[[nid:495878]]another employer, rachel (not her real name), 55, said the maid she employs was taken away on may 2 after testing positive for covid-19 not knowing whether her family was safe and when the maid could return. she earlier got a call from the authorities and was told the maid had tested positive but that rachel and her family were not under quarantine. rachel, who did not want to be named to avoid causing alarm at the daycare facility her father visits, said: ""i was so frightened and sceptical because it was just over the phone. ""over the next three days, she worked from home and stopped sending her father to daycare.  she also called the moh hotline, but the officer could not provide any more details about the helper's status. rachel then received an e-mail from mom on may 5 that informed her that the maid was a ""positive suspect"", and that rachel could go about her daily activities.  she was allowed home on may 9 after it was confirmed she was not infected. rachel said the whole experience was frustrating because of the lack of information.  ""they took her away, and i was in the dark until they e-mailed me three days later, but in between, i couldn't do anything.

2021-06-01,"S$32 million in jobs scheme payouts denied to 1,300 employers for March: IRAS.","singapore: the inland revenue authority of singapore (iras) on monday (may 31) said that it has denied s$32 million in jobs support scheme (jss) and jobs growth incentive (jgi) payouts to 1,300 employers for march. ten cases of suspected jss abuses have also been referred to the police for investigation, iras said in a media release. about s$16 million in payouts was denied for each scheme, with 500 employers affected under the jss and 800 affected under the jgi. overall, iras has withheld s$85 million from 2,600 employers for further checks for march payouts under the jss and jgi.  reviews have been concluded for more than 800 jss payouts and close to 1,100 jgi payouts for the tranche. affected employers will have to submit supporting documents to iras to substantiate their eligibility for the schemes. this is ""part of iras' anti-gaming efforts to ensure that jss and jgi payouts are fairly and correctly disbursed"", the authority said. ""these 2,600 employers make up about 2 per cent of all qualifying employers for the jss and jgi payouts,"" iras said. ""employers will receive their jss and jgi payouts once iras has verified the authenticity and accuracy of the information submitted. ""their payouts would be adjusted or denied if issues are found during the review. ""s$52 million of the withheld payouts fall under the jss while the remaining s$33 million are under the jgi. the jss was introduced as part of the unity budget in february 2020 to provide wage support for employers to retain their local employees amid the covid-19 crisis.  all active employers, except for local and foreign government organisations and representative offices are eligible for the jss. the jgi aids employers in expanding local hiring ""so as to create good and long-term jobs for locals"", iras said on its website.  it is available from september 2020 to september 2021. about s$44 million in jss payouts has been denied since the scheme was implemented. suspected abusesin the process of reviewing the jss and jgi payouts, iras detected a variety of suspected abuses. ""examples include employers making central provident fund (cpf) contributions for non-genuine employees, inflating cpf contributions for employees without actual wage increases and maintaining cpf contributions for employees on wage cuts,"" it said. ""iras has adjusted the payments for employers who readily corrected their erroneous employees' cpf contributions.  some employers had chosen not to respond to iras' requests for clarifications, thus forgoing their payouts. ""a small group of employers had provided what appeared to be fabricated documents in an attempt to substantiate their eligibility for the scheme. ""iras has referred 10 cases to the police for investigation. ""egregious cases of suspected abuse would be referred to the police for further investigations,"" the authority said. police are currently looking into the 10 referred cases which all come under the jss. ""iras has a robust anti-gaming framework that harnesses data analytics and risk profiling to identify risks and prevent abuse,"" the authority said. ""a dedicated team has also been established to review the accuracy of cpf amounts for genuine employees based on actual wages paid. ""iras will continue to review employers' eligibility for subsequent jss and jgi payouts. ""iras added that it has received about 500 reports from whistleblowers on suspected jss and jgi abuses by employers. employers who abuse these schemes may be liable for the offence of cheating, and may face up to 10 years in prison and a fine. downloadour appor subscribe to our telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:https://cna. asia/telegramit looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

""no human cases of h10n3 have been reported in the world, and the h10n3 virus among poultry is low pathogenic.  this case is an occasional poultry-to-human cross-species transmission, and the risk of a large-scale spread is extremely low,"" nhc said.  h10n3 is a subtype of the influenza a virus, also known as the bird flu virus.  h10n3 is normally lethal to wild birds and poultry, as it can spread through respiratory droplets among the animals, just like the flu and covid-19, said yang zhanqiu, a deputy director of the pathogen biology department at wuhan university. it is unknown how this person became infected, but he likely got infected from respiratory droplets of poultry or direct contact with sick live poultry, yang said. it presents a low risk to humans and there is no evidence to indicate that h10n3 virus can cause human-to-human transmission, yang said, adding that we should not overreact to the case, and more monitoring should be carried out to see how it spreads.  cases of humans infected with other types of avian influenza are common.  russia confirmed the first case of human infection with the avian influenza a(h5n8) virus in the world in february, xinhua news agency reported.  central china's hunan province confirmed a human infection case of the h5n6 bird flu virus in december 2020. among the various types of avian influenza, yang said the h5n1 type is highly pathogenic, with a fatality rate of between 40 and 50 percent.  the nhc has instructed jiangsu to carry out relevant epidemic prevention and control measures.  all close contacts of the patient have been put under medical observation.  local authorities have conducted emergency monitoring, with no abnormalities found so far.  the patient's condition is currently stable and is ready to be discharged from hospital, nhc announcement said.  nhc warned the public to avoid contact with sick or dead poultry and to try to avoid direct contact with live poultry.  the h5n8 strain of bird flu has been detected in seven workers at a poultry farm in russia, . . .

""this transfer mechanism recognises how harassment may occur against the backdrop of other ongoing proceedings, such as divorce (ones),"" it stated. various changes to the protection from harassment act (poha) in order to enhance protection for victims of harassment will also kick in on tuesday. a victim applying for a po against his or her harasser need not prove that a provision in poha has been contravened, if the offender has already been convicted of any poha or hurt-related offence against him or her. judges granting epos in egregious cases of hurt or harassment will now be required to consider whether a criminal investigation is warranted and, if so, refer such cases to the police for investigation. pos and epos will be extended to protect people related to the victim, as these individuals may also be harassed by the same perpetrator. the new changes to poha will also make it clear that domestic exclusion orders, which restrain the respondent from entering the applicant's residence or parts of the residence, can also be granted as part of a po. ""this will ensure better protection for victims who may reside in the same residence as the harasser,"" stated the press release on monday.   join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-06-01,Tennis: Osaka withdraws from French Open following row over media boycott.,"paris: japan's naomi osaka stunned the tennis world on monday (may 31) by withdrawing from the french open after deciding to boycott post-match media duties, explaining she had been suffering from depression for almost three years. osaka said in the build-up to the tournament that she would not attend the obligatory press conferences for players after matches, saying the questioning by journalists stresses her mental health. the four-time grand slam champion made good on her threat on sunday when, after winning her first round match, she did not hold a press conference. she was fined us$15,000 by the roland garros referee, and grand slam organisers later issued a strongly worded statement warning of possible expulsion from the french open and future majors if she failed to change her stance. on monday, the world no 2 decided to take matters into her own hands to end the stand-off. ""this isn't a situation i ever imagined or intended when i posted a few days ago,"" the 23-year-old osaka said on twitter. ""i think now the best thing for the tournament, the other players and my well-being is that i withdraw so that everyone can get back to focusing on the tennis going on in paris. ""i never wanted to be a distraction and i accept that my timing was not ideal and my message could have been clearer. ""osaka, one of the biggest names in women's sport, went on to say she had suffered from depression since 2018. ""the truth is that i have suffered long bouts of depression since the u. s.  open in 2018 and i have had a really hard time coping with that,"" she said. ""anyone that knows me knows i'm introverted, and anyone that has seen me at the tournaments will notice that i'm often wearing headphones as that helps dull my social anxiety. ""the french tennis federation (fft), organisers of the tournament, called her withdrawal ""unfortunate. """"we are sorry and sad for naomi osaka. . . we wish her the best and quickest possible recovery, and we look forward to having naomi at our tournament next year,"" fft president gilles moretton said in a statement. he said the major tennis bodies were committed to athletes' wellbeing and improving their tournament experience including their interaction with the media. the women's tennis association (wta) said mental health was one of the highest priorities of the organisation.  ""we remain here to support and assist naomi in any way possible and we hope to see her back on the court soon,"" it said in a statement. after beating serena williams to claim her first major at the 2018 us open, osaka was booed by the crowd during the presentation ceremony as her victory was overshadowed by the american's outburst following a row with the umpire. osaka said that since then, she has struggled in the spotlight.  on monday, said she suffers ""huge waves of anxiety"" before speaking to the world's media. american sofia kenin, who won the australian open and finished runner-up at roland garros last year, said dealing with the media demands of elite tennis was ""definitely not easy"" but it is what players ""signed up for. """"there's expectations from the outside, sponsors and everyone.  you just have to somehow manage it.  you have to have a good team around you who support you,"" the american said. osaka added that she would take some time away from tennis and hoped later to meet the sport's organisers to improve the system. ""i wrote privately to the tournament apologising and saying that i would be more than happy to speak with them after the tournament as the slams are intense,"" osaka said.

2021-06-01,"Hong Kong eases Covid-19 quarantine for vaccinated executives, drawing ire, East Asia News & Top Stories.","read 3 articles daily and stand to win st rewards, including the st news tablet worth $398. spin the wheel for st read and win now. hong kong (bloomberg) hong kong is allowing vaccinated directors and senior executives of major listed companies to travel globally more easily, in a significant relaxation of its onerous border curbs that is drawing backlash from the wider population for being elitist. vaccinated senior executives from about 500 companies included in indexes like the hang seng and hang seng china enterprises can seek permission to travel in and out of the city without needing to follow the current quarantine requirement, hong kong's financial services and the treasury bureau said in an e-mailed statement on monday (may 31). the clarification of a wider policy of exemption for vaccinated executives comes in the wake of a friday announcement that some vaccinated senior bankers can skip quarantine. however, the move is likely to deepen public ire over the special treatment, as hong kong's traveller quarantine requirements are some of the strictest in the world and require people to pay for hotel room stays – the supply of which is rapidly drying up for the summer months.  the current rules stipulate that everyone arriving in hong kong from outside china must isolate in a hotel for up to 21 days. pressure is building on the government to drastically relax quarantine and other social restrictions for vaccinated people as incentives to re-open borders and to boost hong kong's low vaccination rate.  ""it's a step in the right direction.  is that enough? we believe it is by far not enough,"" said mr frederick gollob, chairman of the european chamber of commerce in hong kong. ""with the combination of vaccination and ongoing testing, the hong kong government should further, on a broader scale, reduce the quarantine requirement on the way to reopening the city. ""the latest quarantine exemption is available to other firms from financial industries like banking, mobile payments, insurance, securities and futures intermediaries. companies are allowed a limited quota of exemptions, and the government will review applications based on criteria like where the executive is travelling from. the executives must undergo testing and are required to stick to pre-approved itineraries. an earlier version of the quarantine exemption policy has existed since last year for executives coming from mainland china. singapore, asia's other major financial hub, does not grant exemptions from travel quarantine for business executives.  banks lauded the new announcement.  ""we welcome the new measure providing more convenience to vaccinated senior executives when traveling to hong kong.  this helps encourage resumption of necessary business travel and brings business activities gradually back to normal, which is particularly important to hong kong as an international financial centre,"" said a standard chartered plc spokeswoman in an emailed statement.  hsbc holdings plc said in a statement, ""while the pandemic has showed how much could be accomplished virtually, a measured approach to facilitate business travels to and from hong kong could help stimulate more economic activities across a range of sectors. "" even within the business community however, some think that the exemptions are not being rolled out widely enough. the american chamber of commerce, for example, said that the exemption should be ""extended across sectors. """"all businesses have suffered, and all are keen to get safely back on the road again,"" said the chamber's president tara joseph in a statement.  however, the government has not signalled that it plans to significantly relax social-distancing rules for vaccinated people, such as mandatory outdoor masking, citing the low vaccination uptake. some medical experts also continue to recommend social restriction remain in place in order to prevent another wave of covid-19, particularly as the vaccination rate is low, though local infection numbers have hovered at or near zero for weeks. some critics argue, however, that it's precisely the lack of privileges for vaccinated people is keeping the inoculation rate depressed just 13. 4 per cent of hong kong's population of 7. 5 million has been fully inoculated, according to bloomberg's covid-19 vaccine tracker far behind other finance centres like london and singapore. now that the door has been open for quarantine exemption for some vaccinated people, the policy should be expanded to all fully inoculated people, said professor ben cowling from the school of public health at the university of hong kong.  exemption is ""an evidence-based measure given that vaccinated people are substantially less likely to be infected.  such a measure could also encourage greater vaccination uptake,"" he said.  the government has instead been leaning on businesses and institutions to encourage injections. still, the special treatment meted out to a small elite of executives is likely to further stoke public anger, already at high levels following more than a year of strict social restrictions and quarantine policies that have seen thousands forced from their homes to isolate in government-run camps. the continuing quarantine policies for travellers also means that as vaccinated people in the us and european countries plan their summer travel, almost no one will be able to travel into hong kong without shouldering the prohibitive time and cost of quarantine.  ally, a hong kong citizen who currently lives in canada, said she is extremely upset that ""as long as you are rich and powerful"" you can skip the requirements that most people must observe.  ally, who asked that only her english name be used, said she has been unable to return to hong kong after her father died last year. a single mother, she cannot afford the cost of a 21-day quarantine, which would require her to be away from work without pay. ""you can imagine how infuriating it is that someone else is exempt because of money and i have lost my only remaining parent,"" she said. the issue is not just the time and cost of quarantine. as the length of hotel isolation for those travelling from some countries, including the us, has dropped to two weeks for vaccinated people, demand for rooms has skyrocketed. numerous accommodations, especially those at lower price points, are fully booked through the end of the current quarantine period, which runs until june 19. the food and health bureau said monday in an e-mailed statement that the supply of rooms would be increased from the current 8,300 to 10,000 due to more demand.  some hotels will open up more rooms for booking, it said. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-06-01,China Wrecks IPO Plans for High-Flying Education Startups.,"(bloomberg) -- china is escalating a crackdown on its online education sector, forcing once high-flying startups to mothball plans for multi-billion-dollar initial public offerings this year. just months ago, edtech outfits were one of the hottest investments in china's post-covid internet industry, pulling in more than $10 billion of venture funding last year from powerhouses like alibaba group holding ltd. , tencent holdings ltd.  and softbank group corp.  then beijing stepped in. president xi jinping suggested in march the surge in after-school tutoring was putting immense pressure on on china's kids, signaling a personal interest in curbing excesses.  that led to warnings in state-owned media and penalties aimed at predatory practices that play on a nation's obsession with academic achievement.  now, the country's education ministry plans to create a dedicated division to oversee all private education platforms for the first time, according to people familiar with the matter. the government campaign has brought several potential mega-ipos to a screeching halt.  tencent-backed vipkid and huohua siwei have put off u. s.  listings despite working in concert with banks for months, the people said.  alibaba-invested zuoyebang will likely miss its target of debuting as soon as this year, one of them said.  and tencent-backed rival yuanfudao -- at $15. 5 billion the most valuable of the lot -- isn't going to kick off ipo preparations anytime soon, they said, asking to be identified talking about internal matters. beijing is zeroing in on tutoring startups that thrived when schools sent students home, then launched a marketing free-for-all regulators say is funneling millions of kids into mind-numbing virtual classes with uncertain benefits.  their concern centers not just on reckless pricing or advertising but also on the widening divide between the haves and have-nots -- those who can afford to load up on extra lessons.  to that end, officials laid out a plethora of restrictions this month including limiting the after-school tuition fees companies can charge, and fined yuanfudao and zuoyebang for false advertising claims. chinese media have reported more in the offing, from bans on online courses for kids six years old or younger to restrictions on homework and mandatory licensing for all teachers.  reuters reported that new polices could include a moratorium on weekend classes, which account for more than a third of private tuition in the country according to bloomberg intelligence. ""this could decimate revenue throughout the industry,"" bloomberg intelligence analyst catherine lim said, referring to a blanket weekend ban. yuanfudao declined to comment, while zuoyebang and huohua siwei didn't respond to requests for comment. a spokesman for vipkid declined to comment on any ipo plans, but said the company is following updates in the education sector closely. read more: edtech startup zuoyebang said to weigh $500 million u. s.  ipostay-at-home tutoring was growing in popularity around the world -- particularly in asia -- even before covid 19 scrapped in-person classes.  but it's in china that the industry has taken on a life of its own.  on any given day, at least 50 million students -- the equivalent of the entire population of spain -- could use zuoyebang's platform, the company has claimed. that sheer scale is why the country's online education startups have become some of the world's most valuable after attracting $10. 5 billion of funding last year, more than was raised in total over the previous three years, according to research firm preqin.  china's online learning market was expected to reach 315 billion yuan ($49. 5 billion) in 2020, almost triple from five years ago, according to global market data tracker statista. it also helps explain why xi's administration is taking unusually direct steps to influence the industry's evolution in china.  his government in general is keen to curtail the growing influence of internet giants like tencent and alibaba, among the industry's biggest backers, through a series of regulatory probes and record fines. officials are also concerned about hundreds of millions of parents plowing their savings into online classes, while subjecting children to increasingly onerous workloads.  as with past booms built on shaky ground -- say, in peer-to-peer lending or improperly licensed wealth management products -- beijing stepped in quickly to defuse what it perceived to be a potential ticking time bomb. the fallout was swift.  gsx techedu inc. , new oriental education & technology group inc.  and tal education group -- which mainly operate physical schools but serve as barometers of industry sentiment -- have shed $55 billion of value since the start of march.  investors from softbank and sequoia to hillhouse capital and tiger global, among the biggest proselytizers of past years, have been sideswiped by the ferocity of the regulatory clampdown and have in many cases been forced to pull back from lucrative exits. on monday, gsx said it is shutting its pre-school education business for children aged 3 to 8 and cutting staff.  china decided to ban kindergarten and private-tutoring schools from teaching the elementary-school curriculum from june 1, a spokeswoman said. others however remain unfazed for now.  zhangmen education inc. , which filed for a u. s.  ipo on may 19, plans to test investors' confidence despite the regulatory uncertainties.  the e-learning upstart backed by warburg pincus and softbank has yet to pull back on a listing plan, according to one person with knowledge of the matter.  and on may 25, jiayi, a beijing firm operating both online and offline tutoring centers, also filed for an ipo in hong kong.  both however cite intensifying competition and new regulatory requirements among their risk factors. zhangmen didn't immediately provide comment. that fierce rivalry comes through in unexpected -- occasionally ominous -- ways. in january, a social media furor erupted after companies including yuanfudao, zuoyebang and bytedance ltd. 's education unit hired the same actress to pose as a teacher on their platforms, local media reported.  the same bespectacled woman presented herself as english and math teachers in different promotion material. in one of the promo videos posted online, she took direct aim at parental paranoia -- precisely what regulators railed against.  the actress, flogging a 33-hour live-streaming course package that cost just $8, warned that missing out has consequences. ""it could be parents themselves who ruin their kids,"" she said. read more: alibaba-backed edtech startup hires cfo ahead of likely u. s.  ipo(updates with gsx changes in 15th paragraph)more stories like this are available on bloomberg. comsubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source. ©2021 bloomberg l. p. related quotesisolated storms in north texas could produce as much as five inches of rain. two men accused of spying for china went on trial tuesday in warsaw — a chinese citizen who is a former sales director of huawei in poland and a polish cybersecurity expert.   the men, weijing wang and piotr durbajlo, have both pleaded not guilty. join us for a hybrid info session to learn about the weekday mode of the part-time mba.  limited space available, so secure yours today!retailers and unions negotiating over a legally binding workers' safety accord in bangladesh due to expire on monday reached a tentative deal to extend it by three months, unions involved in discussions said, provided the around 200 signatory retailers agree on the extension.   the signatories which include top apparel retailers like zara-owner inditex have until june 10 to state whether they agree, a spokesperson for uni global union, one of the unions involved, said.   at least 10 have given their consent, according to uni global union, including h&m, which confirmed it had agreed to the extension. frankfurt (reuters) -euro zone inflation surged past the european central bank's elusive target in may, heightening a communications challenge for policymakers who will happily live with higher prices for now but may face a backlash from irate consumers.   inflation in the 19 countries sharing the euro accelerated to 2% in may from 1. 6% in april, driven by higher energy costs to its fastest rate since late 2018 and above the ecb's aim of ""below but close to 2%"", data from eurostat showed on tuesday. sydney (reuters) -australia's big banks are likely to return a record $15 billion or more of cash to investors over the next two years, with investors betting commonwealth bank will move first and helping drive shares of the top lender to all-time highs.   commonwealth bank and its smaller rivals australia and new zealand banking group, national australia bank and westpac banking corp have made a remarkable comeback, from being shamed in a public inquiry and shunned by investors three years ago to being sought-after investments now.   the banks have come out of the covid-19 crisis relatively unscathed as australia has kept the pandemic under control and its a$2 trillion ($1. 5 trillion) economy has hummed along. ,《》《》,,!washington (reuters) -the u. s.  supreme court on tuesday declined to hear johnson & johnson's bid to overturn a $2. 12 billion damages award to women who blamed their ovarian cancer on asbestos in the company's baby powder and other talc products.   the justices turned away a j&j appeal and left in place a missouri state court ruling in litigation brought by 22 women whose claims were heard together in one trial.   the missouri court of appeals, an intermediate state appellate court, last year ruled against j&j's bid to throw out the compensatory and punitive damages awarded to the plaintiffs but reduced the total to $2. 12 billion from the $4. 69 billion originally decided by a jury. j. p.  morgan warns of more pain ahead for bitcoin prices.  here's why. hong kong (reuters) -top glove corporation's plan to list in hong kong and raise up to $1 billion has been delayed as the world's largest rubber glove maker seeks to resolve a u. s.  import ban on its products, sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.   the delay is another setback to the malaysian company from a ban on imports on its products imposed in july by the u. s.  customs and border protection (cbp) citing forced labour practices.   top glove, which is already listed in kuala lumpur and singapore, flagged in april it would sell 793. 5 million shares in the listing, half what it proposed in its application to the hong kong bourse in february. ,,?,! /  / ,!(bloomberg) -- malaysian stocks dropped and the ringgit weakened after the government imposed a two-week nationwide lockdown to curb a relentless surge in covid-19 infections. the ftse bursa malaysia klci index fell as much as 1. 6% on monday, before paring losses to 0. 7% at the close in kuala lumpur.  the ringgit slid as much as 0. 4% to 4. 1480 per dollar, while 10-year bond yields rose three basis points to 3. 25%.  the government said on friday that most businesses will be shut from june 1 except for essential economic and service sectors.

(bloomberg) -- zimbabwe's mines minister has informed todal mining ltd. , a venture controlled by eurasian resources group, that its platinum mining concessions could be seized because no progress has been made in developing them. the bokai and kinonde concessions may be taken over under the ""use-it/lose-it principle"" which allows the state to repossess idle mining claims, minister winston chitando said in a letter to todal dated may 28 and seen by bloomberg.  the mines ministry confirmed the veracity of the document. ""i note with concern that over the last few years there have been several changes to the work program to make this project progress to production stage,"" chitando said in the letter. zimbabwe, which has the world's third-biggest platinum group metal reserves, has struggled to develop its mining potential with investors from russia, cyprus, nigeria and kazakhstan yet to bring projects into production. the todal assets were taken from anglo american platinum ltd. , which does operate a mine in zimbabwe, more than a decade ago and handed to central african mining & exploration co.  that company was bought by eurasian natural resources co. , which later became eurasian resources group.  central african mining lent the zimbabwean government $100 million at the time.

(bloomberg) -- sign up for the new economy daily newsletter, follow us @economics and subscribe to our podcast. turkey's economy has continued to grow at a strong pace so far this year, but that doesn't necessarily mean its citizens are getting richer. the $717 billion economy likely outperformed all group of 20 nations except for china in the first quarter after nearly stalling a year ago when the pandemic struck.  it's been bolstered by robust consumption on the back of last year's government-led credit push, an expansion that came at the expense of price and currency stability. data on monday is likely to show gross domestic product rose 6. 3% from a year earlier and 1. 3% from the fourth quarter, according to the medians of forecasts in bloomberg surveys.  treasury and finance minister lutfi elvan said thursday that ""data point to 6% growth in the first quarter. ""there is an ""exchange rate illusion"" in turkey's economic growth data, according to enver erkan, chief economist at istanbul-based tera yatirim, who's ranked by bloomberg as the most accurate forecaster on turkish gdp data. noting that the gdp per capita in u. s.  dollar terms dropped nearly 40% since 2013 to around $7,700 last year, erkan said turkey's recent economic model isn't sustainable as the growth is mainly driven by consumption supported by government spending and loan campaigns. ""this comes at the expense of lira and price stability,"" he said. the government pushed banks to ramp up lending to help businesses and consumers ride out last year's covid-19 emergency.  the credit boom was coupled with a front-loaded easing cycle that helped prime the economy.  that growth push weakened the currency by 20% last year and kept headline inflation in double digits.  the size of the economy dropped to $717 billion last year from $760. 8 billion a year earlier. the currency further lost 10% against the dollar in the first quarter, especially after president recep tayyip erdogan fired the central bank's former hawkish governor naci agbal in march.  the decision to fire agbal, who had sought to restore the central bank's credibility, set off a swift reversal of investor enthusiasm, sending turkish markets into a nosedive. the data expose the challenge facing new central bank governor sahap kavcioglu as he looks to restore price stability without cooling the economy ahead of the general elections in 2023. kavcioglu has pledged policy continuity after his appointment and kept benchmark interest rate unchanged at 19% for a second meeting this month, saying the pace of price gains had peaked in april.  consumer inflation quickened for a seventh month to 17. 14% in april. more stories like this are available on bloomberg. comsubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source. ©2021 bloomberg l. p. all asset classes.  industry-leading prices.  user-friendly investing online. bitcoin's range play continues even as short-term price indicator turns bullish. the bulk of share trading in the european union takes place on exchanges with relatively little inside banks, an industry body said on tuesday in a bid to stop what it called bourses seeking to ""perpetuate their dominance"".   the eu is reviewing its stock and bond trading rules, known as mifid ii, triggering a battle between exchanges and their top customers, the banks and large asset managers, over competition.   the eu's securities watchdog esma has estimated that nearly half of trading is off an exchange, prompting bourses to call for this part of the market to face tougher curbs so that more trading goes onto 'lit' venues like the main exchanges. the dogecoin price may be finishing may off its highs for the month, but it has still been a rock star asset after advancing more than 6,000% year-to-date. ,brussels (reuters) -finance ministers from the group of seven rich nations (g7) will vow this week to support their economies as they emerge from the pandemic and reach an ""ambitious"" deal on a minimum global corporate tax in july, a draft communique showed.   g7 officials, set to meet in london on june 4-5, will also say that once the recovery is well established, they will need to ""ensure long-term sustainability of public finances"", which is understood to be code for a gradual withdrawal of stimulus.   the g7 comprises the united states, japan, britain, germany, france, italy and canada. dubai/paris (reuters) -qatar airways has clashed with european planemaker airbus over the painting of an a350 jetliner in a heated dispute that threatens to delay a resumption of european deliveries to the gulf carrier, industry sources said.   chief executive akbar al baker has criticised airbus without giving details of the dispute, but the sources said it involves the latest in a series of quality-control spats between the airline and airbus.   qatar airways and airbus declined to comment. climate activists who scored big against western majors last week had some unlikely cheerleaders in the oil capitals of saudi arabia, abu dhabi and russia.   defeats in the courtroom and boardroom mean royal dutch shell, exxonmobil and chevron are all under pressure to cut carbon emissions faster.

2021-06-01,"Sri Lanka, Facing ‘Worst’ Marine Disaster, Investigates Cargo Ship Fire.","advertisementsupported bya fire has raged on a cargo ship off the coast of sri lanka for 12 days, sending toxic chemicals and tons of plastic into the country's waters and polluting its beaches. by aanya wipulasena and mujib mashalcolombo, sri lanka — the authorities in sri lanka have opened a criminal investigation into the crew of a cargo ship laden with toxic chemicals that has been burning off the island nation's coast for 12 days, spilling debris into the ocean and polluting the country's beaches. several tons of plastic pellets that were being transported on the ship have washed ashore, and sri lanka's marine protection authority described the spill as ""probably the worst beach pollution in our history. "" security personnel have been employed to scour the country's beaches for the pellets used in the production of plastic bags and fishing has been discouraged for miles along the coast. a spokesman for sri lanka's navy said the fire, which broke out aboard the ship, mv x-press pearl, on may 20, had been contained, but on tuesday thick, black smoke was still seen rising from the burned containers on the ship's deck. the spokesman, captain indika de silva, said the ship was carrying 1,486 containers, many of which contained so-called dangerous goods, including nitric acid, caustic soda, sodium methoxide and methane. the ship was loaded with 350 tons of oil, and a combination of heavy fuel and marine fuel.  captain de silva said it was ""too early to say about an oil spill,"" but warned that there was ""still a possibility. """"this is one of the worst marine disasters that has happened in sri lanka,"" said dr.  asha de vos, a marine biologist.  ""our only saving grace is that there was no oil spill.  if that happens, that will be incredibly tragic. ""x-press feeders, the company that operated the vessel, said that a container onboard had been leaking nitric acid well before the ship entered the waters off sri lanka, a teardrop-shaped island near india. the ship's crew requested it be permitted to offload the leaking container at two previous stops, in india and qatar, but were denied because the ports lacked the ""specialist facilities or expertise"" needed to ""deal with the leaking acid,"" according to x-press feeders. the police have questioned the ship's crew and sent contaminated water samples to labs for testing.  of the 25 crew members who were rescued and taken to quarantine facilities, two required treatment for injuries sustained during the evacuation and one tested positive for covid-19, the ship's operator said. as the authorities seek to determine the cause of the fire, locals living along the coast near colombo, the capital, have began a major cleanup. ""i have never seen anything like this before,"" said dinesh wijayasinghe, 47, an employee at a hotel in the coastal town of negombo.  ""when i first saw this, about three to four days ago, the beach was covered with these pellets.  they looked like fish eyes. ""mr.  wijayasinghe said sri lankan security personnel have collected as many as 200 bags worth of plastic pellets every day since the fire began. ""still, more keeps washing ashore,"" he said.  ""we are told not to go to this area.  so we are keeping away. ""dr.  de vos, the marine biologist, said the amount of plastic found on the island's western and southern coasts was troublingplastic pollution, he said, can be a danger to humans and animals, including endangered species like turtles, which hatch their eggs on the beach. ""the pellets can soak and absorb the chemicals from the environment,"" he said.  ""this is an issue because when we eat whole fish, we will also be eating these chemicals.

[[nid:202301]]in january 2018, the smc wrote to the minister for health appealing against the committee's decision.  in may 2019, the ministry of health (moh) directed the smc to appoint a disciplinary tribunal to look into the matter. dr deshan was informed in march 2020.  because of the circuit breaker measures for covid-19, the pre-inquiry conference was delayed till june. the tribunal said the harm caused was ""moderate"", but culpability was low as it had not been premeditated. it noted that the doctor had been ""suffering from persistent depressive disorder"" at that time, caused by stress both at work and at home. he has been treated for this and it no longer affects him.  however, the tribunal recommends that he continues with his treatment every two to three months. as penalty, it imposed a four-month suspension, followed by conditional registration for a year during which he may only work under supervision.  other conditions include no ""private consultations without a chaperone present when attending to female patients"". he was also censured and has to pay the cost of the proceedings.  the decision was published on the smc website on june 1. this article was first published in the straits times.  permission required for reproduction.

2021-06-01,Singapore and Covid-19.,"read 3 articles daily and stand to win st rewards, including the st news tablet worth $398. spin the wheel for st read and win now. my fellow singaporeans, for the last three weeks, we have been on heightened alert. we had discovered new clusters of covid-19 infections.  one cluster at tan tock seng hospital, and then another at changi airport.  more cases soon followed.  we also started seeing unlinked cases, implying community spread.  so we had to step back from phase three. we went on heightened alert to reduce social interaction and new infections.  everyone has responded, to cooperate on the measures we had to take.  offices, malls, and the streets are all visibly quieter. because of your support, the number of daily cases has come down.  barring another super-spreader or big cluster, we should be on track to bring this outbreak under control. we will know for sure in another week or so.  meanwhile, i count on everyone to keep up our efforts and stay vigilant.  please continue to stay home, work from home if possible, and go out only if you must.  most importantly, if you feel unwell, see a doctor immediately even if you have been vaccinated. if our situation continues to improve, and the number of community cases falls further, we should be able to relax the restrictions after june 13. compared to a year ago, when we had our first big outbreak, we are in a much better position today.  we have built up our testing and contact tracing capabilities.  crucially, our vaccination programme is well advanced.  with stronger defences in place, we have not had to impose a full circuit breaker. unfortunately, we are also fighting new, more infectious variants of the covid-19 virus.  the b117 variant, which was first detected in the uk, has become widespread in the us and many other countries. we are now dealing with the b1617. 2 variant, which was first detected in india and is now in over 50 countries.  more variants will inevitably emerge, and we will have to deal with them too. what does a more infectious virus mean for our fight against covid-19? it implies that we must continually adjust our strategies, and raise our game to keep covid-19 under control. specifically, there are three things that we have to do more of, and do faster: testing, contact tracing, and vaccination. let me briefly explain.  the multi-ministry taskforce (mtf) will provide details later on. first, we must test faster, and more liberally and extensively.  this will enable us to detect covid-19 cases more quickly.  so that we can isolate them and ring-fence their contacts promptly, before the virus spreads further. many different types of covid-19 tests have become available, for example, antigen rapid tests (arts), saliva tests, breathalysers, wastewater surveillance, even sniffer dogs.  we have been using some of these, and evaluating others, for some time.  each of these new tests is suited to different use cases. for example, arts produce results much faster than the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) tests that we have mostly relied on.  arts are also cheaper and easier to administer.  however, they are less sensitive than pcr tests.  they may miss some cases that are actually covid-19 positive.  arts are therefore invaluable as a quick check. if you visit a gp or polyclinic now with an acute respiratory infection, you will be given an art, in addition to a pcr test.  within 30 minutes, the art will show whether you are likely to have covid-19.  if the result is positive, you can immediately be isolated and the pcr test will confirm your diagnosis later, which may take a day or two.  that way we reduce your chances of infecting others, if you are already ill but don't realise it. other tests are coming on stream.  breathalyser tests, which take just one minute, have been set up at the causeway and the airport.  they can be deployed to many other places too and soon you will be able to purchase diy tests over the counter at pharmacies.  they are simple to use, and not so uncomfortable.  you can administer these on your own.  if you are worried that you may have covid-19 and want to put your mind at ease.  or if you are a front-line worker, and want to test yourself frequently or even daily. these alternatives to pcr tests help us detect and isolate persons quickly when they are most infectious.  this will be a big help in slowing down the spread of covid-19. as the virus mutates to become more transmissible, we must respond by testing more widely. we already do rostered routine testing (rrt) in a number of higher-risk settings: migrant worker dormitories, construction worksites, shipyards, air and sea ports, hospitals and nursing homes. with faster, cheaper tests, we can do routine testing at more workplaces, like offices, restaurants and shopping malls. we can also routinely test individuals whose occupations involve close contact with many people, and could result in superspreading events, like taxi drivers and bus captains, physiotherapists, masseurs, stage performers, sports and fitness instructors and educators; (they) could all be tested regularly.  this will reassure their customers, patients and students, and enable them to work safely even with covid-19 in circulation. in short, we are shifting our approach to testing.  henceforth we will not only test to identify infections when a new case pops up, we will also routinely and regularly test people who appear well, in normal work or social or community settings, to make them, and these places safe. extensive testing will give us confidence to resume larger-scale events or gatherings.  for example, we can deploy fast and easy tests before a religious service, a football game, a concert, or a wedding reception and participants can be assured that the event is covid-19 safe. therefore, you should expect routine, large-scale, fast and simple testing to be part of our new normal. second, we will contact trace faster and more widely.  our contact tracing operations have vastly improved.  the contact tracers are working faster and better because they have more experience and skills, and better tools. tracetogether helps them identify and quarantine close contacts of an infected case within hours rather than days.  with safeentry, they can identify thousands of people who had visited the same places as infected cases, and inform these potential contacts to come forward for a free covid-19 test.  this is what we did for white sands, jem and westgate, and now ntuc foodfare in anchorvale. because of singaporeans' self-discipline, public spirit and support of tracetogether and safeentry, we are contact tracing faster and more comprehensively.  we can improve our contact tracing further by casting the net wider. our experience has shown that if a close contact is infected, he is quite likely to infect others who stay with him in the same household.  therefore, in future, when we identify a close contact of an infected case, we will not only isolate him the first-degree contact and test him for covid-19, we will also notify his household members to isolate themselves immediately, without waiting to see whether the first-degree contact tests positive. if later the first-degree contact tests negative, we can safely release his household members from isolation. but if later the first-degree contact tests positive, we will have saved precious time by isolating his household members earlier.  this more aggressive approach will help us to shut down clusters more quickly, to lead to fewer cases. third, we will vaccinate more people, and faster.  we have made good progress since vaccinations started in december.  our healthcare and front-line workers, and the majority of those 45 and above, have already received at least their first dose.  these are the ones more at risk from covid-19. now, vaccination of those aged 40 to 44 is under way. the mtf recently announced that we would speed up vaccinations in the next two months, and prioritise first dose vaccinations.  this is in progress.  we want to protect as many singaporeans as possible, and as soon as we can, especially with the new covid-19 variants.  this approach will quickly provide the maximum number of people with good protection, instead of a good number of people with maximum protection. we are vaccinating as many people as our supplies allow.  our 40 vaccination centres islandwide are running smoothly.  the constraint is vaccine supply.  this is why we have been working very hard to confirm and speed up deliveries of vaccines from our suppliers. i am happy to report that since the last update by the mtf, we have received further confirmation of faster vaccine deliveries over the next two months.  with the latest supply schedule, we can further boost our vaccination programme.  we can offer the vaccine to everyone, even sooner than we expected. the next group to be vaccinated will be students.  in this latest outbreak, we have seen more cases of children getting infected, in schools and tuition centres.  the children were not seriously ill, but parents are naturally worried.  therefore, we will take full advantage of the june holidays to vaccinate students.  bookings will open tomorrow. we will give priority to the graduating cohorts for o, n, and a levels, as well as special needs students.  then the other students 12 years and above will take their turn, including students in our institutions of higher learning. after the students, we will vaccinate the final remaining group, young adults 39 years and younger.  this should start around mid-june.  this group is quite large.  therefore, we will give the singaporeans among them a two-week priority window to book your appointments first, before we open up to the rest who want to be vaccinated. finally, i want to make a special pitch to our elderly. your response has been excellent.  nearly three quarters (73 per cent) of our elderly 760,000 senior citizens aged 60 and above have had at least one jab or booked a slot already.  but 280,000 of you have still not yet booked appointments.  please come forward to get jabbed as soon as possible. most people of your age have already been vaccinated, including many of your friends and neighbours. the president and i have been vaccinated too, and so have all my cabinet colleagues.  the vaccines are safe, and they will keep you safe. we will make the process even more convenient for you.  if you are above 60, you can now walk into any vaccination centre, and get vaccinated on the spot.  no need to register, no need to book in advance, just turn up at a vaccination centre, and you will be jabbed. if you are not mobile, or are unable to make your way to the vaccination centre, contact the silver generation office, a doctor and nurse will visit you at your home to give you the vaccination. for those with elderly parents or relatives, please encourage and persuade your old folks to get vaccinated. today, nearly four in 10 residents have had at least one dose of the vaccine.  our next target is to get two-thirds of residents vaccinated with at least the first dose. with our accelerated vaccination programme, we should be able to do this by early july, provided supplies come in as planned.  and everyone who is eligible for a vaccination and wants one should be able to get at least their first jab by national day. whether you are old or young, please come forward to be vaccinated once it is your turn.  with the more infectious virus strains, we need as many people as possible to be vaccinated, in order to reach herd immunity, or get close to it.  this is the way to make everyone safe and resume more normal activities. even as we tackle our covid-19 situation, the pandemic rages on around us.  many countries are still not able to bring it under control, fully, much less eliminate it. india has suffered a huge surge of new cases, although their numbers are now coming down.  in south-east asia, many countries have not started vaccinations in a big way, and may see more spikes in the next few months.  malaysian cases have been rising, and they are just entering a nationwide full lockdown.  even places that have kept covid-19 well under control, like taiwan, australia and vietnam, have recently experienced outbreaks. one day, this global pandemic will subside but i do not expect covid-19 to disappear.  it will remain with humankind, and become endemic.  the virus will continue to circulate in pockets of the global population for years to come. this also means we will see small outbreaks of the disease from time to time in singapore as well. in this new normal, we will have to learn to carry on with our lives even with the virus in our midst. our aim must be to keep the community as a whole safe, while accepting that some people may get infected every now and then.  just as we do with the common flu or dengue fever, which we now manage through public health measures and personal precautions.  and in the case of the flu, with regular vaccinations too. covid-19 vaccinations will not entirely prevent you from getting covid-19 but vaccination makes this much less likely.  and if you do get sick, despite being vaccinated, you are also much less likely to become very ill. living with endemic covid-19 also means we do not completely close our borders.  we need food, essential supplies, workers, business and other travellers to keep on flowing.  we must stay connected to the world, with effective safeguards and border restrictions to keep ourselves safe. we will not be able to prevent some infected persons from slipping through from time to time.  but as long as our population is mostly vaccinated, we should be able to trace, isolate, and treat the cases that pop up, and prevent a severe and disastrous outbreak. singapore's priority is to get through this pandemic and position ourselves strongly for the future, even as the virus continues to rage around us.  if we stay united and continue to work together, we will be able to progressively open up, and achieve our aim. in the new normal, covid-19 will not dominate our lives.  our people will be mostly vaccinated, and possibly taking booster shots every year.  we will get tested often, but it will be fast and easy.  we will go to work or school, meet friends and family, participate in religious services, and enjoy entertainment and sports events. we will reopen our borders safely.  visitors will again come to singapore.  singaporeans will travel again to countries where the disease is well under control, especially if we have been vaccinated.  and eventually, we will even go about without masks again, at least outdoors. right now, we are some ways off from this happy state, but we are heading in the right direction. in this new normal, the countries which are united, disciplined, and put in place sensible safeguards will be able to reopen their economies, reconnect to the rest of the world, grow and prosper. singapore will be among these countries.  more confident and resilient than before, and toughened by what we have overcome together, and experience together as one nation. i have outlined our strategy for the next phase of the fight against covid-19.  to keep our people safe, while reopening progressively. we have to test, we have to trace, we have to vaccinate and we have to do all three of these more quickly, and more extensively. the heightened alert has two more weeks to go.  i thank singaporeans for your forbearance, cooperation and support.  each individual effort counts.  our collective discipline and social responsibility have served us well, and taken us thus far. let us go the distance together as one people, so that we can look forward to a new normal, and emerge as a stronger and more united singapore. thank you. join st's

for st read and win now.', 'my fellow singaporeans, for the last three weeks, we have been on heightened alert.', 'we had discovered new clusters of covid-19 infections.', 'one cluster at tan tock seng hospital, and then another at changi airport.', 'more cases soon followed.', 'we also started seeing unlinked cases, implying community spread.', 'so we had to step back from phase three.', 'we went on heightened alert to reduce social interaction and new infections.', 'everyone has responded, to cooperate on the measures we had to take.', 'offices, malls, and the streets are all visibly quieter.', 'because of your support, the number of daily cases has come down.', 'barring another super-spreader or big cluster, we should be on track to bring this outbreak under control.', 'we will know for sure in another week or so.', 'meanwhile, i count on everyone to keep up our efforts and stay vigilant.', 'please continue to stay home, work from home if possible, and go out only if you must.', 'most importantly, if you feel unwell, see a doctor immediately even if you have been vaccinated.', 'if our situation continues to improve, and the number of community cases falls further, we should be able to relax the restrictions after june 13. compared to a year ago, when we had our first big outbreak, we are in a much better position today.', 'we have built up our testing and contact tracing capabilities.', 'crucially, our vaccination programme is well advanced.', 'with stronger defences in place, we have not had to impose a full circuit breaker.', 'unfortunately, we are also fighting new, more infectious variants of the covid-19 virus.', 'the b117 variant, which was first detected in the uk, has become widespread in the us and many other countries.', 'we are now dealing with the b1617.', '2 variant, which was first detected in india and is now in over 50 countries.', 'more variants will inevitably emerge, and we will have to deal with them too.', 'what does a more infectious virus mean for our fight against covid-19?', 'it implies that we must continually adjust our strategies, and raise our game to keep covid-19 under control.', 'specifically, there are three things that we have to do more of, and do faster: testing, contact tracing, and vaccination.', 'let me briefly explain.', 'the multi-ministry taskforce (mtf) will provide details later on.', 'first, we must test faster, and more liberally and extensively.', 'this will enable us to detect covid-19 cases more quickly.', 'so that we can isolate them and ring-fence their contacts promptly, before the virus spreads further.', 'many different types of covid-19 tests have become available, for example, antigen rapid tests (arts), saliva tests, breathalysers, wastewater surveillance, even sniffer dogs.', 'we have been using some of these, and evaluating others, for some time.', 'each of these new tests is suited to different use cases.', 'for example, arts produce results much faster than the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) tests that we have mostly relied on.', 'arts are also cheaper and easier to administer.', 'however, they are less sensitive than pcr tests.', 'they may miss some cases that are actually covid-19 positive.', 'arts are therefore invaluable as a quick check.', 'if you visit a gp or polyclinic now with an acute respiratory infection, you will be given an art, in addition to a pcr test.', 'within 30 minutes, the art will show whether you are likely to have covid-19.', 'if the result is positive, you can immediately be isolated and the pcr test will confirm your diagnosis later, which may take a day or two.', ""that way we reduce your chances of infecting others, if you are already ill but don't realise it."", 'other tests are coming on stream.', 'breathalyser tests, which take just one minute, have been set up at the causeway and the airport.', 'they can be deployed to many other places too and soon you will be able to purchase diy tests over the counter at pharmacies.', 'they are simple to use, and not so uncomfortable.', 'you can administer these on your own.', 'if you are worried that you may have covid-19 and want to put your mind at ease.', 'or if you are a front-line worker, and want to test yourself frequently or even daily.', 'these alternatives to pcr tests help us detect and isolate persons quickly when they are most infectious.', 'this will be a big help in slowing down the spread of covid-19.', 'as the virus mutates to become more transmissible, we must respond by testing more widely.', 'we already do rostered routine testing (rrt) in a number of higher-risk settings: migrant worker dormitories, construction worksites, shipyards, air and sea ports, hospitals and nursing homes.', 'with faster, cheaper tests, we can do routine testing at more workplaces, like offices, restaurants and shopping malls.', 'we can also routinely test individuals whose occupations involve close contact with many people, and could result in superspreading events, like taxi drivers and bus captains, physiotherapists, masseurs, stage performers, sports and fitness instructors and educators; (they) could all be tested regularly.', 'this will reassure their customers, patients and students, and enable them to work safely even with covid-19 in circulation.', 'in short, we are shifting our approach to testing.', 'henceforth we will not only test to identify infections when a new case pops up, we will also routinely and regularly test people who appear well, in normal work or social or community settings, to make them, and these places safe.', 'extensive testing will give us confidence to resume larger-scale events or gatherings.', 'for example, we can deploy fast and easy tests before a religious service, a football game, a concert, or a wedding reception and participants can be assured that the event is covid-19 safe.', 'therefore, you should expect routine, large-scale, fast and simple testing to be part of our new normal.', 'second, we will contact trace faster and more widely.', 'our contact tracing operations have vastly improved.', 'the contact tracers are working faster and better because they have more experience and skills, and better tools.', 'tracetogether helps them identify and quarantine close contacts of an infected case within hours rather than days.', 'with safeentry, they can identify thousands of people who had visited the same places as infected cases, and inform these potential contacts to come forward for a free covid-19 test.', 'this is what we did for white sands, jem and westgate, and now ntuc foodfare in anchorvale.', ""because of singaporeans' self-discipline, public spirit and support of tracetogether and safeentry, we are contact tracing faster and more comprehensively."", 'we can improve our contact tracing further by casting the net wider.', 'our experience has shown that if a close contact is infected, he is quite likely to infect others who stay with him in the same household.', 'therefore, in future, when we identify a close contact of an infected case, we will not only isolate him the first-degree contact and test him for covid-19, we will also notify his household members to isolate themselves immediately, without waiting to see whether the first-degree contact tests positive.', 'if later the first-degree contact tests negative, we can safely release his household members from isolation.', 'but if later the first-degree contact tests positive, we will have saved precious time by isolating his household members earlier.', 'this more aggressive approach will help us to shut down clusters more quickly, to lead to fewer cases.', 'third, we will vaccinate more people, and faster.', 'we have made good progress since vaccinations started in december.', 'our healthcare and front-line workers, and the majority of those 45 and above, have already received at least their first dose.', 'these are the ones more at risk from covid-19.', 'now, vaccination of those aged 40 to 44 is under way.', 'the mtf recently announced that we would speed up vaccinations in the next two months, and prioritise first dose vaccinations.', 'this is in progress.', 'we want to protect as many singaporeans as possible, and as soon as we can, especially with the new covid-19 variants.', 'this approach will quickly provide the maximum number of people with good protection, instead of a good number of people with maximum protection.', 'we are vaccinating as many people as our supplies allow.', 'our 40 vaccination centres islandwide are running smoothly.', 'the constraint is vaccine supply.', 'this is why we have been working very hard to confirm and speed up deliveries of vaccines from our suppliers.', 'i am happy to report that since the last update by the mtf, we have received further confirmation of faster vaccine deliveries over the next two months.', 'with the latest supply schedule, we can further boost our

""nee soon town council has done a thorough cleaning and disinfection of the common area at block 745 and the surrounding blocks,"" he said. separately, mandatory testing will also be carried out at blocks 501 and 507 hougang avenue 8, after covid-19 viral fragments were detected in wastewater samples collected from these blocks.  there are currently no known covid-19 cases there. the tests for all three blocks will be conducted on tuesday and wednesday between 9am and 4pm. leaflets will be distributed and sms notifications will be sent out to residents to provide them with more information, added moh. ""residents are also advised to monitor their health closely and consult a doctor immediately if they feel unwell. ""earlier, moh had identified 11 covid-19 cases from at least four households in block 506 hougang avenue 8.  two of these were detected from a mandatory testing exercise for residents. on may 24, the 304 residents of block 559 pasir ris street 51 were asked to go for testing after four covid-19 cases were detected in two households there. the ministry of health said on may 25 that all those tests have come back negative. responding to a question raised at a press conference on covid-19 on monday on the circumstances requiring all residents from a block to be tested, singapore's director of medical services, associate professor kenneth mak, said that when clusters in the domestic setting are picked up, the team will start by looking at the obvious chains of transmission and ""the modes of transmission that are of concern"". ""when we pick up several cases that occur within a fixed geographic vicinity, then we have to be concerned that there may also be chains of transmission that occur to other people that live in that same area,"" said prof mak. ""and this is the reason why we would then extend and carry out testing operations in a housing precinct involving several blocks of flats,"" he explained. these testing operations are also reinforced by looking at data from other testing methods, such as wastewater testing. screening wastewater samples could complement clinical testing and provide an additional indicator to assess the level of covid-19 spread within a community. this is because infected individuals, including those who have mild symptoms or are asymptomatic could still be shedding the virus in their stool. prof mak noted that this may raise concerns as it could suggest that there are additional people who may be asymptomatic but are potentially infectious to others, creating a sense of urgency to launch testing operations at the respective housing blocks. ""so we look at each cluster on a case-by-case basis, looking at the circumstances and making that decision (on) whether we want to organise these testing operations,"" he said. though such operations are not easy to carry out, prof mak said, they are necessary as part of singapore's aggressive testing to stay ahead of the curve and prevent further infections in the community. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

""sia sought and obtained strong shareholder support for the additional mcbs at the april 2020 extraordinary general meeting (egm), with 99. 66 per cent of shareholders approving the resolution,"" the airline said in a response issued via the singapore exchange on tuesday (june 1) morning. ""this was subsequently renewed at the july 2020 annual general meeting (agm), where 99. 76 per cent of shareholders approved the resolution to issue the additional mcbs before the next agm in july 2021.

[[nid:482931]]besides the $6. 2 billion in fresh liquidity it hopes to raise through the latest mcbs, it also has $2. 1 billion in untapped lines of credit on top of all the other funds raised. because the mcbs are considered equity, sia has more headroom for further debt financing going forward, if needed. sia said the proceeds would strengthen its financial foundations to meet ongoing financial commitments, allow it to make the necessary investments and capitalise on any opportunities that may arise so as to secure its industry-leading position, as well as provide resources for growth as it navigates through the ongoing crisis. ""the successful implementation of the group's strategy is also dependent on its ability to retain its talented and motivated employees, and to continue having a strong employer brand to attract new talent,"" said sia. it added that it had a pipeline of new-generation aircraft airbus a350s and boeing 787s on order that it could use for further secured financing and sale and leaseback transactions. the airline expects the proceeds to last well through its financial year 2022/2023.

""they will not replace existing scientific names, but are aimed to help in public discussion,"" said dr maria van kerkhove, the who's covid-19 technical lead. under the new system, the variants of concern take on the following names: the hitherto so-called british variant b117 becomes alpha; the b1351 first detected in south africa becomes beta, while the brazilian p. 1 becomes gamma. the so-called indian variant b1617 is split into sub-lineages, of which the b16172 variant of concern becomes delta. the b16171 variant of interest is called kappa. besides these names, there are two other scientific names in use for each mutation, while different geographic names have been used to describe the same variant. for example, within britain, what other countries have been referring to as the british variant is often called the kent variant the county in south-east england where it was first detected. the lineage names such as b1172 will still continue to be used in scientific circles, for the mutation information that their name conveys.

2021-06-01,An F&B in turmoil — S'pore chefs share how they're coping with the dining-in ban.,"go on a kayaking expedition at pulau ubinsingapore — ""zat, do you know why f&b workers are not given priority for covid-19 vaccination?"" chef dylan ong asks over direct chat on instagram the week when phase 2 (heightened alert) started. his question came amidst a press conference where the newly-minted minister for health, ong ye kung, announced a new vaccination strategy that extends the time between doses so that the maximum number of people can be protected.  students between the ages of 12-15 will also be eligible for the pfizer biontech vaccination. phase 2 (ha) was announced due to the rising number of unlinked covid-19 cases and the emergence of clusters in singapore with his round of tightened measures spanning 16 may to 13 june 2021.  some of the limitations enforced by phase 2 (ha) are reduced social gathering size to two people (down from five) and reenacting working from home as a default. dining-in would also no longer be allowed at all f&b outlets across the island, including at hawker centres, coffee shops, and food courts. for some of the chefs and restaurant owners, i spoke to, this outright ban on dining-in left them blindsided and reminded them a lot of what happened in april last year when singapore enacted circuit breaker measures for three months. ""i was surprised because i thought any new wave would have been mitigated by our collective efforts of mask-wearing, social-distancing, and the usage of contact tracing apps,"" willin low, chef and founder of wild rocket, shared with me over whatsapp.  ""also, don't we have very stringent border controls that include swab tests and strict quarantine measures?""chef dylan was running lunch service at his restaurant, the masses, when he heard of the announcement on friday, 14 may.  ""it was too short a notice for something this drastic to happen by sunday.  for restaurants, saturday will definitely be a full house, especially when it's the last day of dining-in before phase 2 (ha) kicks in.  how do i find time to pivot to full delivery service over one day?""""yes, i know we have done this before,"" dylan went on to say.  ""but it would have been so much better had the government given us an earlier heads up.  i know it's a critical situation that requires decisive decision making.  i expected the government to be more sensible than to dole out this knee-jerk reaction. ""the question of priority vaccination for f&b workersto be completely honest, i've never questioned why people working in the f&b industries weren't given priority for vaccination—at least not until dylan asked.  his concerns, though, were understandable. in phase 3 that commenced on 28 dec 2020, dining in a group of up to 8 people was permitted.  up until the announcement of phase 2 (ha), eating at restaurants remained the only close contact group activity where masks can be taken off during the entire meal duration—presenting a higher possibility for the virus to spread if safe distancing measures and sanitisation procedures weren't properly adhered. the perilous state of dining-in was further exacerbated by recent reports that the kopitiam food court at changi airport terminal 3 was visited by several confirmed cases, some of which have already been vaccinated.  changi airport would eventually be named as one of the largest active clusters in phase 3, swelling to more than 100 people. ""a thousand things went through my mind when the ban on dining-in was announced.  but my foremost worry was the safety of my staff, especially since this new b16172 variant is said to be more infectious than the last,"" said chef johanne siy of lolla at amoy street. ""my greatest concern was both the drop in sales and the increased number of cases that might put my colleagues at risk,"" dominic tan, founder of ajumma's, shared.  ""the daily rise in cases also doesn't assure us that the restrictions will last for only one month. ""minister lawrence wong, co-chair of the covid-19 multi-ministry task force, has since remarked that the current phase 2 (ha) measures are working and that no further tightening is expected. concerns over employabilityearly this year, phase 3 measures brought some much-needed relief for f&b establishments affected by circuit breaker measures.  some chef-owners i spoke to last month in march even lamented the lack of staff to handle the onslaught of reservations from diners—customers with money to spare and nowhere to spend it except locally through staycations and to dine out at restaurants. this aura of upbeat positivity has drastically taken a tumble, even if only based on anecdotes.  while circuit breaker seems more a test of inventiveness and how pivot-ready f&b businesses are, phase 2 (ha) is shaping up to be solely about survivability. ""i guess in a way, we are more prepared today than previously as we have at least experienced it once and know what to expect,"" said chef willin.  ""the main challenge now is how to ensure all my colleagues, and i keep our jobs. ""it's a concern shared by the co-founder of apollo coffee bar, shirlynn eng.  ""to us, the team is family, and despite the circumstances, our priority is to make sure that our employees will be taken care of.  many of our crew have families both in singapore and internationally—these countries include malaysia, vietnam, and the philippines. """"so our priority is clear.  to do whatever it takes to support and sustain their livelihood. ""concerns over long-term financial stabilitychef dylan readily admits that, like many other chefs, he's now more operationally prepared for delivery and takeaway services even with a tight runway of one day. but at its core, he posits that the problems and issues remain the same.  f&b owners tend to run with a tight financial capital—any form of disruption in dining-in revenue will most certainly hit them hard. ""unfortunately, it's even harder now as we're unsure what financial support we can get from the government to tide us over.  will there be rental rebates for this one month also? none of us knows. ""although not immediately announced—and in some ways quite telling of how rushed these phase 2 (ha) measures are—rental relief for smes was recently introduced on 28 may 2021 by finance minister lawrence wong. under the rental support scheme, privately owned commercial properties can look forward to getting a half month rental relief cash payout directly from the inland revenue authority of singapore. ""from a business standpoint, i think it will be so much harder to survive this round,"" said chef johanne.  ""there's so much more competition from established players and new home-based businesses.  it seems idealistic, but i hope everyone can find a place in the sun and somehow find a way to survive.

""iko is only three weeks old, and i'm once again facing a ban on dining-in.  it's a new brand that has, unfortunately, come to a standstill after all that marketing effort we put out; it's heartbreaking. ""it's now evident that with every enactment and tightening of covid-19 measures, the industry where the effects are most keenly and immediately felt is in the f&b sector. according to the singapore department of statistics, f&b sales registered a year-on-year decline of 26% in 2020.  it was the worst-performing year since the growth rate was first recorded back in 1986, surpassing the asian financial crisis in 1998, sars in 2003, and the global financial crisis in 2009. in dollar terms, retail and f&b sales registered a decline of about s$4 billion during circuit breaker. could phase 2 (ha) measures be better mitigated?with such sobering statistics gleaned from circuit breaker last year, i wondered how the sudden ban on dining-in, and in retrospect, phase 2 (ha) measures could have been better mitigated, especially given that we have experience and prior knowledge on hand. for dominic, government mitigation and intervention could have been offered earlier, even before phase 2 (ha) measures were enacted. ""i feel that earlier support to manage crowds at f&b establishments could have been put in place, such as encouraging landlords to allow installation of clear perspex or acrylic sheets within the restaurants to create a safer dining environment for diners,"" said dominic. dylan, however, was less enthused about how the government went about handling the ban on dining-in. ""we have done this before.  why are we still so lacking in how we prepare the people of singapore for such drastic measures? government leaders were put in place so they can have better foresight than us ordinary citizens.  this kind of knee jerk reaction speaks volumes of the kind of leaders we have now. """"i'm just extremely disappointed with how this is being handled,"" dylan went on to add. in our initial interview, willin wondered if there could have been a more gradual easing in of restrictions by cutting down the number of diners allowed per group instead of implementing such a drastic and sudden outright ban. ""but in view of the 38 local transmissions today (16 may 2021), i guess what the government is doing regarding the ban on dining-in does not seem too out of line, given how infectious this new strain is,"" said willin a few hours after the number of new community cases was announced. when life gives you lemonswhile waiting for dining-in to resume, some restaurants are taking a 'when life gives you lemon' approach to the pivot rerun to delivery and takeaway. at birds of a feather, chef eugene see has put together food bundles featuring signature dishes from the restaurant and its four sister brands.  there's the ""french toast"" from halcyon & crane, ""salmon grain bowl"" from 51soho, ""king prawn noodles"" from chuan hung noodle stall and the signature ""find the chicken in the chillis"" from birds of a feather. ""by offering this bundle, we hope our customers can experience what we can offer for our food delivery at a group level, and at the same time, bring the best food items to their doorsteps,"" chef eugene shared. at shirlynn eng's five cafe concepts—apollo coffee bar, neptune cafe, columbus coffee co. , lunar coffee brewers, and atlas coffeehouse—diners can look forward to the 'choux box', a care package iteration inspired by the first circuit breaker.  then, shirlynn witnessed first-hand the rising practice of people gifting their friends or loved ones 'care packages'.  there's also an encouraging response to the care packages shirlynn rolled out at the time. as the end date for phase 2 (ha) on june 13 draws to a close, chefs and restaurant owners wait with breath that is bated for dining-in to resume and, for many of us ordinary citizens, for life to regain some semblance of normalcy—however that may look. undoubtedly, these are tough times for the f&b sector, made more challenging with razor-thin profit margins, disruptions in the supply of raw ingredients due to tightened border controls, and, funnily enough, a vibrant local dining scene with every operator eager for a slice of the proverbial pie. perhaps shirlynn puts it best.  ""we just want our friends, family, and customers to live a little amidst this tough time, love a lot, and laugh over these delightful treats.  it's perhaps exactly what we need these days to get through these four weeks—joy and spontaneity.

2021-06-01,UN Nuclear Watchdog Concerned Over Undeclared Iran Sites.,"iran failed to answer questions about fourth site where natural uranium may have been present: un agencythe un nuclear watchdog monday voiced concern that iran had not clarified queries over possible undeclared nuclear activity, adding that its enriched uranium stockpile was 16 times over the limit. the two reports issued by the international atomic energy agency (iaea) on monday are the first substantive reports since iran suspended some inspections in february. last week the iaea said it had extended a temporary agreement with iran until june 24 which has allowed many inspections to continue. the report said iaea director general rafael grossi was ""concerned that the technical discussions between the agency and iran have not yielded the expected results,"" referring to exchanges on the sites where undeclared nuclear activity may have occurred. the conclusion comes despite a ""proactive and focused effort"" launched by the iaea in april ""to break the impasse"" over the sites. the iaea says that the results of its inspection work have established ""a clear indication that nuclear material and/or equipment contaminated by nuclear material has been present"" at three undeclared locations, with most of the activity in question dating back to the early 2000s. the agency also said iran has failed to answer questions regarding a fourth site where natural uranium may have been present between 2002 and 2003 in the form of a metal disc. iran and world powers are engaged in talks in vienna to rescue the 2015 nuclear deal after former us president donald trump walked away from it in 2018 and reimposed crippling sanctions on tehran. trump's successor joe biden has signalled his willingness to revive the plan. for this to happen, the us would need to return to the accord and lift the sanctions reinstated by trump while tehran would have to re-commit to full compliance with nuclear obligations it progressively withdrew from since 2019. in a separate report, the iaea said iran's stockpile of enriched uranium is around 16 times the limit laid down in the 2015 deal with world powers. it gave an estimate of a stockpile of 3,241 kilogrammes (7,145 pounds) but said that it was not able to verify the total. the limit laid down in the 2015 deal was 300 kilogrammes of uranium in a particular compound form, the equivalent of 202. 8 kilogrammes of uranium. 'sabotage' blast -a senior diplomat with knowledge of the issue said that while the suspension of some inspections meant that the iaea could not give precise figures for the stockpile, its level of access to declared sites has not been greatly reduced and its stockpile estimate would still be accurate to within a few percentage points. the rate of production of enriched uranium has slowed since the last quarterly report from the iaea in february. in april iran said a ""small explosion"" had hit its natanz nuclear facility, an act that tehran branded ""sabotage"" by its arch-foe israel. in monday's report the iaea estimated 62. 8 kilogrammes of the uranium stockpile had been enriched up to 20 percent and 2. 4 kilogrammes up to 60 percent. under the 2015 deal, the enrichment level was meant to be capped at 3. 67 percent, well below the 90 percent purity needed for a nuclear weapon. the latest report will be presented to the iaea's board of governors next week. talks to restore the 2015 deal are taking place in vienna as iran prepares for presidential elections on june 18. the press had widely predicted a showdown between ultraconservative judiciary chief ebrahim raisi and moderate conservative ali larijani, a key domestic backer of the 2015 deal. however, last week larijani was barred from standing.

""these two lintels are evidence of our rich and prosperous history dating back many centuries ago,"" he said, thanking us authorities and the thai foreign affairs ministry for the ""relentless pursuit of the sandstones"". itthiphol also said the government is still deliberating whether they would be taken to smaller, local museums in the provinces of buriram and sa kaeo, which border neighbouring cambodia. the lintels have features that mirror famed cambodian temples showing the influence and reach of the ancient khmer kingdom and are believed to have been stolen out of thailand between 1958 and 1969. as music blared, thai traditional dancers in gold-flecked dresses donning plastic face shields performed during the unveiling ceremony for the artefacts. massive towers of fruit were also on display around flower wreaths an offering to the gods to protect the lintels. itthiphol said there are still ""13 more buddha statues and engraved artefacts waiting to be repatriated from the us"". the california museum had disputed investigators' allegations that the artefacts were stolen, and insisted it had long planned to return them. us museums are not the only ones to be embroiled in art provenance scandals in recent years. australia has repatriated at least eight looted statues to india since 2014. france has vowed to return items taken from senegal and benin, while the netherlands is moving to repatriate artefacts stolen from its former colonies. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-06-01,Singapore's DBS Issues SGD 15 Million Digital Bond in First Security Token Offering.,"
may 31, 2021 @ 10:49 am by omar faridi singapore-based dbs bank ltd (sgx:d05), a multinational banking and financial services corporation with over $330 billion in assets, revealed on monday (may 31, 2021) that it has priced a sgd 15 million (appr.  $11. 35 million) digital bond, which marks dbs digital exchange's (ddex) first security token offering as part of its efforts to provide a wide range of products. the dbs digital bond, which has come with a six-month tenor and coupon rate of 0. 60% per annum, was carried out through a private placement.  dbs is reportedly the sole bookrunner for the transaction. this transaction should help pave the way for other issuers and clients to leverage ddex's capabilities to gain access to capital markets for their funding requirements.  it may also lead to more security token issuances and listings on ddex as asset tokenization becomes more widely-adopted. eng-kwok seat moey, group head of capital markets at dbs, said that digitalization through the issuance of security tokens offers a great opportunity for corporates looking for alternative platforms like ddex to raise capital from apac region's fast-evolving private capital markets. at present, the asia-pacific region accounts for almost one-third or over 30% of the international private equity market, which reached a record $4. 73 trillion last year. in order to encourage more participation from investors, the digital bond will reportedly be traded in board lots of sgd 10,000 (appr.  $7,560). this is a considerably smaller denomination when compared to traditional wholesale bonds, which usually require investment and trading amounts that can be multiples of sgd 250,000. with this new listing of the digital bonds on ddex, the securities will be available for secondary trading to institutional and accredited investors who may be members or clients of ddex. introduced in december of last year, ddex is part of an integrated crypto-asset ecosystem that utilizes blockchain or distributed ledger tech (dlt) to offer a secure and transparent platform to raise capital via the private market. dbs stated that the ddex has seen strong market traction since it went live last year.  daily trading volumes have surged by as much as 10x from when the platform was first launched.  the exchange is now serving more than 120 participants.  dbs also holds more than sgd 80 million in crypto-assets in its custody services. eng-kwok seat moey stated:""our maiden sto listing on the dbs digital exchange is a significant milestone, as it highlights the strength of our digital asset ecosystem in facilitating new ways of unlocking value for issuers and investors.  we expect asset tokenisation to increasingly become more mainstream as more of our clients start to embrace security token issuance as part of their capital fund raising exercise which we believe will boost singapore's ambitions to be a digital asset hub in asia. ""clifford lee, global head of fixed income at dbs, noted that this marks the first of many other steps as they work towards streamlining the bond issuance process. lee added:""while most bond tokenization exercises announced in asia to date tend to be repackaged forms of a conventional bond issue, the current transaction directly combines existing legal and tax infrastructure requirements with a direct issuance on the digital exchange in smaller lot sizes.  this bond token structure was only made possible because of the progressive development of singapore's legal and tax infrastructure, which can facilitate more sto issuances to broaden and deepen our capital markets.

2021-06-01,The Singapore Core cannot be anything other than Singaporeans: PSP's Youth Wing leader Jess Chua.,"""the singapore core cannot be anything other than singaporeans,"" said progress singapore party (psp) youth wing leader jess chua, referring to deputy prime minister heng swee keat's remarks earlier in may when he said that the ""singapore core"" should not be too narrowly defined in terms of whether someone is singapore-born, a new citizen, or a foreigner who is helming a company. mr heng had said on 17 may at a press conference by the emerging stronger taskforce, ""that test for us must be the commitment to singapore, the commitment to the well-being of singapore and of singaporeans,"" he said. responding to this, ms chua took to facebook on 23 may to express her dismay over the dpm's comments and took issue with his choice of using ""commitment"" as a yardstick on who forms the singaporean core. she wrote, ""while certain commitments may span decades, others last a few years or even just a season. ""work commitment for example is rewarded with remuneration and ends once the employment contract ceases. ""on the other hand, citizenship is a life-long commitment that does not come with pre-negotiated benefits.  in most cases, people do not get to choose their citizenship – it is a natural bond often lasting a lifetime.  singapore citizens, natural or naturalised alike, must be the singapore core.  period. ""using chicken rice as an analogy, ms chua explained that while the chilli sauce add flavour, it is not the core of the dish which is the chicken and the rice.  in this analogy, citizens are the chicken and rice while foreigners are the chilli sauce. she added, ""a good chilli sauce merely complements the chicken rice but can never be the chicken rice itself. """"in the same vein, foreign labour complements our local workforce by supplying missing skillsets, or by filling up positions in sectors which the local workforce may be unsuited for. ""she went on to stress that non-singaporeans are not unimportant just because they do not make up the core of the nation, highlighting how they have been part of singapore's society and will continue to be called on to complement the local workforce. where some may decide to sink in roots here, like ms chua's own mother, others may decide to return to their home countries.  when this happens, the country does not lose part of its core, she stressed. ""our singapore core is irreplaceable,"" ms chua emphasised, adding that government policies must be built around this core even if it may not produce quick results or not be more cost-effective in the short term. in the earlier press conference, mr heng had said that in his own experience running the monetary authority of singapore (mas) during the 2008 to 2009 financial crises, many chief executives of international banks in singapore had given him outstanding advice on how to deal with the crisis, thus demonstrating that they had singapore's interest at heart. he had said, ""some of the ceos from these banks are as singaporean as singaporeans who were born in singapore and went through national service,"" adding that some of them eventually became citizens. countering this, ms chua shared her own experience working with many non-singaporeans in her time at multinational companies, people who are ""committed"" to their work and ""appreciative"" of what singapore has to offer. however, she added: ""regardless of their abilities and level of contributions, none of them came to singapore out of altruism; they did not travel across countries merely wanting to help build singapore or boost our gross domestic product. ""they came here to seek better opportunities for themselves – and there is nothing wrong with that. ""while singapore benefited from their contributions, they in turned gained the means to lead better lives and/or to better provide for their own families. ""she cautioned, ""the powers that be should not obfuscate the singapore identity to suit their political objectives,"" and emphasised that the singapore core cannot be anything other than singaporeans. she also shared the 1978 national day parade theme song, ""we are singapore, singaporeans"", describing it as her favourite national day song for it's ""meaningful, simple and unambiguous lyrics"". ""now it serves as a beacon to be for what the singapore core should be,"" she concluded.  © 2006 2021 the online citizen© 2006 2021 the online

2021-06-01,Netizens question MOH & MOM protocols after another case of MDW being released early from SHN only to test positive for COVID-19 again later.,"about two weeks after former model and dj jade rasif publicly shared her traumatising experience with her migrant domestic worker (mdw)'s confusing quarantine order and subsequent events, news of a similar case has made the spotlight. in this case, the straits times reported on tuesday (1 june) of a hotel worker whose new maid was discharged from stay-home notice (shn) just five days in despite testing positive on the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) test.  she had arrived from indonesia on 15 april. according to reports, the mdw's employer, known only as ms lee, was concerned by the early discharge.  she checked with the isolation facility where the helper was quarantined and was told she had nothing to worry about as the indonesian's serology test came back positive.  they said this indicates that it was a past infection. unfortunately, two weeks later the helper tested positive on a mandatory swab test.  she had been living with ms lee and her two elderly parents and her brother since she was released from shn. following the second test, she was taken by ambulance to the national centre for infectious diseases (ncid). this is eerily similar to what happened with ms rasif's helper who was released from quarantine just three days after arriving in singapore instead of the full 14-days that was paid for. two weeks after being released, however, ms rasif received a phone call informing her that her helper needed to be tested for the virus again.  the test came back positive and the helper was picked up by an ambulance and taken to a quarantine centre. similar to ms rasif, when ms lee was informed that her helper was suspected to be positive with covid-19, her family was told they could still continue with their daily activities but decided to self-quarantine anyway. on 8 may when the helper was swabbed again, after testing negative twice, ms lee was told that her family of 12 would have to quarantine. ms lee was quoted by st saying: ""we were speechless at this point.  we thought it was safe to go about our daily lives, and had met so many people at work and school. . .  we were also worried for the safety of our parents, who have chronic illnesses. ""the family has since completed their quarantine and cleared their swab tests.  their helper's status remains unclear, however.  though she was discharged on 25 may after serving the full 21 days of shn and the family was told she was no longer infectious, a ministry of health (moh) doctor who spoke to ms lee said it was unclear if the helper had been reinfected. ms lee's and ms rasif's helpers are among several mdws who had been discharged from shn early only to test positive for covid-19 again a few weeks later. now, since 5 february, all mdws with recent travel history to high-risk countries are required to take an on-arrival serology test and pcr test. moh had clarified with toc back in march that the additional on arrival serology test ""will allow for the identification of workers who have recovered from an old covid-19 infection and have antibodies"". those who test positive on the serology test ""can therefore be released from shn,"" said moh, as it indicates a past infection. this second story in as many weeks about another mdw who was released early, has netizens on edge, as many on the straits times facebook page are questioning the protocols implemented by both the ministry of health (moh) and ministry of manpower (mom). many wondered if the moh shouldn't just require the helpers to complete the full shn period to be safe, instead of releasing them early even with a positive serology test to indicate a past infection. a couple of people even noted that the employers had paid for a full shn, so it shouldn't be a problem to have the helpers be quarantined for the full duration. one user expressed worry over the case and wondered how many other similar cases are out there and have ""contributed other infected cases"".  the user also wondered if these cases of ""past infected but till infectious"" are considered linked or unlinked. several people called for an investigation to be carried out into this ""serious lapse"" as well as moh's protocol and staff.  one person called out the mom for not clarifying these lapses yet. while another described these cases as signs of ""complacency"" on the government's part in allowing early releases from shn.  © 2006 2021 the online citizen© 2006 2021 the online

            Aguero was the 'worst trainer' at City, says ex-teammate.","home  all the news  aguero was the 'worst trainer' at city, says ex-teammatedate published: monday 31st may 2021 10:44                 lewis oldham micah richards has claimed that sergio aguero was the ""worst trainer"" at man city, but it was ""game over"" when it came to his finishing. richards was still a key part of city's defence when aguero joined the club in 2011 for around £35m. the forward made an instant impact as he shone during his debut season in the premier league.  he scored the vital goal that secured them the title on the final day of the campaign. if solskjaer is sacked then guardiola must go too. . . over the years, aguero has established himself as one of man city's greatest ever players.  he scored 260 goals for them from his 390 outings across all competitions. the striker's contract with city expired at the end of the season and he has now joined barcelona on a two-year deal.  richards has told bbc sport that at times, aguero would not ""even have his boots tied up"" for training:""from the moment he came through the door, you are in awe.  you have that feeling of 'wow'.  the only other time i had that was when robinho came through the door.  for us growing up, shaun goater or nicolas anelka was a big thing – so when aguero comes, you can't believe this is happening. ""he was the worst trainer in the history of training.  he had that laid-back style.  aguero would just walk around.  sometimes he wouldn't even have his boots tied up.  but the moment it came to the finishing, it was game over.  i thought he was going to be sensational but when i trained with him i thought 'have we made a mistake here?' i thought tevez was better – but then he makes his debut. . . ""the fans just erupted when he came on and it was like a genuine superstar here.  you can't write it and from them i knew we had signed a player. ""i was there for four years with him.  with aguero, you don't associate him with being a superstar in terms of how he was off the pitch.  he was the most humble person ever. ""

""while jaywalking by elderly pedestrians contributed to some of these accidents, many accidents also arise from irresponsible driving behaviour on the motorist's part, such as failing to slow down when approaching a pedestrian crossing. ""the situation may be improved with greater care on the part of motorists,"" said mha. for example, for failing to slow down or give way when approaching pedestrian crossings, offenders will incur eight demerit points, up from six, outside silver zones and school zones. driving or riding against the flow of traffic in these zones will likewise incur eight demerit points instead of six.  composition fines for light vehicles will be $300, up from $200, and $350 for heavy vehicles, up from $250. a motorist who runs a red light, which is a 12-demerit point offence when committed outside a silver zone and school zone, will incur 14 demerit points when committed in the zones. the motorist can be fined $500 instead of $400 for all vehicles.  this is the maximum composition fine for all 12-demerit-point offences, which is capped at half of the maximum court fine of $1,000. a composition fine allows an offence to be settled with a fine, without having to be convicted in court. mha said it will monitor accident rates for heavy vehicles in silver zones and school zones, and review the cap on composition fines if necessary. the stiffened measures for motorists in these zones come after other ongoing efforts by the traffic police to enhance road safety for elderly pedestrians.  these include public education for the elderly and enforcement measures for pedestrians at jaywalking hot spots. the land transport authority has also included additional crossing points and lanes with reduced width to slow down traffic at silver zones. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-06-01,Hong Kong prosecutors seek up to life in prison for 'subversive' activists.,"kalvin ho, one of the 47 pro-democracy activists charged under the national security law for participating in an unofficial primary election last year, was denied bail in march/afpdozens of leading hong kong democracy activists could face up to life in prison for organising an unofficial primary election, prosecutors confirmed monday, in the most sweeping use yet of beijing's strict new security law. police charged the 47 activists with ""subversion"" after they organised a non-binding vote last year to choose candidates for an ultimately postponed local election. the defendants say they were simply taking part in opposition politics. but authorities accused them of a ""vicious plot"" to subvert the government by seeking a majority in the city's partially-elected legislature. on monday the defendants appeared en masse for the first time in nearly three months at a hearing in which a judge granted a request by prosecutors to have the case upgraded to the city's high court. offences heard in that court start at seven years imprisonment for those who are convicted.  the maximum penalty under the new security law is life in prison. beijing has moved to quash dissent in the semi-autonomous city after huge and sometimes violent pro-democracy demonstrations in 2019. the security law criminalises anything authorities deem to be subversion, secession, terrorism or collusion with foreign forces. police and prosecutors have since applied the law broadly with the vast majority of those charged for political speech. under the new law — which beijing imposed directly on the city last june — defendants may only be granted bail if they can persuade a court they no longer pose any kind of national security risk. that clause has removed hong kong's common law tradition that maintains a presumption of bail for non-violent crimes. monday's proceedings were the first time the public was able to see most of the defendants since early march when the vast majority — 36 — were denied bail at a mammoth hearing. that hearing dragged on for so many days that some of those in the dock collapsed from exhaustion. bail decisions published since that hearing have revealed that judges are deciding whether some of those in custody still pose a potential security risk. claudia mo, a former lawmaker, was denied bail partly because of whatsapp messages with foreign journalists in which she commented on news and political events. another former lawmaker jeremy tam saw his application turned down in part because the united states consulate invited him by email for a ""catch up"" — even though the email went unanswered. in both instances judges argued the fact that the two defendants remained influential meant denial of bail was needed. china says the national security law is needed to restore stability. critics say it has eviscerated the freedoms hong kong was promised ahead of its handover and has rapidly begun to change city's vaunted, business reliable common law traditions. — afp © 2006 2021 the online citizen© 2006 2021 the online

2021-06-01,Iran fails to explain uranium traces found at several sites: IAEA report.,"vienna: iran has failed to explain traces of uranium found at several undeclared sites, a report by the un nuclear watchdog showed on monday (may 31), possibly setting up a fresh diplomatic clash between tehran and the west that could derail wider nuclear talks. three months ago britain, france and germany scrapped a us-backed plan for the international atomic energy agency's 35-nation board of governors to criticise iran for failing to fully explain the origin of the particles; the three backed off as iaea chief rafael grossi announced fresh talks with iran. ""after many months, iran has not provided the necessary explanation for the presence of the nuclear material particles at any of the three locations where the agency has conducted complementary accesses (inspections),"" a report by grossi to member states seen by reuters said. it will now be up to the three european powers to decide whether to revive their push for a resolution criticising iran, which could undermine wider negotiations to revive the 2015 iran nuclear deal at talks currently underway in vienna.  grossi had hoped to report progress before the board meets again next week. ""the director general is concerned that the technical discussions between the agency and iran have not yielded the expected results,"" the report said. ""the lack of progress in clarifying the agency's questions concerning the correctness and completeness of iran's safeguards declarations seriously affects the ability of the agency to provide assurance of the peaceful nature of iran's nuclear programme,"" it added. in a separate quarterly report also sent to member states on monday and seen by reuters, the agency gave an indication of the damage done to iran's production of enriched uranium by an explosion and power cut at its natanz site last month that tehran has blamed on israel. iran's quarterly increase in its stock of enriched uranium was the lowest since august 2019 at just 273kg, bringing the total to 3,241kg, according to an iaea estimate.  it was not able to fully verify the stock because iran has downgraded cooperation. that total is many times the 202. 8kg limit set by the nuclear deal, but still well below the more than six tonnes iran possessed before the deal. damage to natanzat iran's main enrichment plant, which is underground at natanz, the agency verified on may 24 that 20 cascades, or clusters, of different types of centrifuges were being fed with uranium hexafluoride feedstock for enrichment.  a senior diplomat said that before the explosion that figure was 35-37. after washington pulled out of the nuclear deal in 2018 under president donald trump and re-imposed crippling economic sanctions against tehran, iran began breaching the deal's restrictions on its nuclear activities as of 2019. one of its more recent breaches, enriching uranium to 60 per cent, a big step towards weapons-grade from the 20 per cent it had previously reached and the deal's 3. 67 per cent limit, continued.  the iaea estimated that iran had produced 2. 4kg of uranium enriched to that level and 62. 8kg of uranium enriched to up to 20 per cent. iran's production of experimental quantities of uranium metal, which is prohibited under the deal and has prompted protests by western powers because of its potential use in the core of nuclear weapons, also continued.  iran produced 2. 42kg, the iaea reported, up from 3. 6 grams three months ago. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-06-01,"China's new three-child policy draws scepticism, cost questions.","beijing: china's decision to allow families to have up to three children was met with scepticism on tuesday (jun 1), with doubts expressed on social media whether it would make much difference, and calls for details on what promised ""supportive measures"" will include. on monday, beijing announced that it waslifting the two-child limitin an effort to encourage more child-bearing, weeks after census data confirmed rapid aging and a decline in fertility that puts china on track to see its population, the world's largest, begin shrinking. the major policy shift will include supportive measures ""conducive to improving our country's population structure"", the official xinhua news agency said. ""i don't quite understand.  what's the meaning of supportive measures?"", asked one weibo user in a post that received more than 128,000 thumbs-up, the most popular comment on xinhua's post on the three-child policy. social media participants cited the high cost of raising children in urban china, where housing can be expensive and children undergo private tuition in addition to public schools amid a fiercely competitive education system, as deterrents to having kids. women in china already face a widening gender gap in terms of workforce participation and earnings, and have borne a growing share of childcare duties as state-supported childcare has declined, according to a report last year by the peterson institute for international economics. ""working women in the big cities will be further discriminated against, and it would be harder for women over 30s to find jobs,"" said another weibo user. the xinhua readout from monday's politburo meeting chaired by president xi jinping said that in conjunction with the new policy china would lower educational costs, step up tax and housing support and guarantee the legal interests of working women, but did not give specifics. james liang, a professor at peking university's school of economics and founder of online travel giant trip. com, last month urged china to give parents of each newborn 1 million yuan to lift a fertility rate of just 1. 3 children per woman in 2020.  that rate is in line with countries such as japan and italy and far short of the 2. 1 replacement rate. he said this week that china would need to spend about 5 per cent of gdp, compared with ""practically 0 per cent now"", in cash, tax breaks, housing subsidies, day care and other incentives in order to get the fertility rate up to about 1. 6, and expects the government soon to step up building day-care centres and kindergartens. developed counties typically spend 1 per cent to 4 per cent of gdp on such support, he said. ""the one i'd really like to see is the housing subsidy, especially in large cities,"" he said.  ""if the local government can return (land tax) or give discounts to couples with a third child or second child,"" it would be helpful, he said. uptick and declinewhen china scrapped its one-child policy in 2016 there was a brief uptick in births followed by a decline that has steepened as costs continue to rise. yi fuxian, a university of wisconsin scientist and longtime critic of chinese birth policy, said the decades-long one-child policy entrenched attitudes. in japan, he noted, costly policies such as free childcare and education, housing subsidies for young couples and free medical care for kids helped lift the fertility rate from 1. 26 in 2005 to 1. 45 in 2015, only for it to drop to 1. 36 in 2019. ""having just one child or no children has become the social norm in china.  social and economic patterns cater to the one-child policy, so the inertial effects linger on,"" he said. the global times, a nationalistic tabloid published by the ruling communist party's people's daily, acknowledged the difficulty of having three children in big cities but also said economics was not the only factor. ""it is equally important to change some habitual views of children and family values in a society with a declining birth rate, and to form new expectations and acceptability, as well as views on happiness,"" it said in an editorial. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

this year's tokyo olympics will see over 150,000 condoms being given away to athletes as souvenirs.  ― picture by yusof mat isa

follow us on instagram and subscribe to our telegram channel for the latest updates. kuala lumpur, june 1 ― this year's tokyo olympics will see more than 150,000 condoms given out to athletes as souvenirs of their time in japan. however, the organiser is not encouraging the athletes to use it at the games village but to bring it back to their own countries. quoting the games organiser, tokyo-based news site soranews24 reported that they wanted to raise awareness about sexually-transmitted diseases. in other words, the olympic condoms are meant to be souvenirs from the competitors' time in japan, which they will enjoy using once they are back home. the organising committee is said to be examining the specific distribution process, implying that perhaps they won't be given out until after the games are done and athletes are leaving the village. it has been a tradition since the 1988 seoul olympics that athletes staying in the olympic village be provided with condoms. the tokyo olympics is scheduled to start on july 23 with no spectators from overseas at its venues due to the covid-19 pandemic. loading. . . © 2021, malay mail, all rights reserved.

2021-06-01,FAQ: What you need to know about the COVID-19 vaccination exercise for students.,"singapore: singapore is expanding its national covid-19 vaccination programme to include students, with registrations for more than 400,000 schoolchildren aged 12 and above to open on tuesday (jun 1). theannouncement, made by prime minister lee hsien loong in a televised speech on monday, comes after the pfizer-biontech vaccine was approved by the health sciences authority for those aged 12 to 15 earlier this month. the exercise will begin with graduating cohorts from secondary schools and at the pre-university levels, said the ministry of education (moe) in a separate press release.  slots will be available from jun 3. here are some frequently asked questions about the vaccination exercise for students and how they can get their jab. q: how do i register for the vaccine for myself or my child?a: eligible students aged 18 and above as well as parents of children below 18 will progressively receive smses with a unique registration link, said the education ministry. graduating cohorts from secondary schools and at the pre-university levels in particular, students sitting for the gce n-, o- or a-level examinations later this year will be the first to receive the vaccination invitation. over the next two weeks, the remaining full-time students in schools and institutes of higher learning will receive their invitations to register for the vaccine, said the education ministry. this includes privately-funded schools, madrasahs and special education schools, said moe in the press release.  privately-funded schools comprise anglo-chinese school (international), st joseph's institution international high school and hwa chong international school. parents of students in graduating cohorts who do not receive the sms by jun 3 should contact their children's school for assistance. ""schools will also be reaching out to parents of students in mainstream primary and secondary schools separately with additional details on their vaccinations.  in general, students who are in schools and the institutes of higher learning should receive their smses by the end of the second week of june,"" said moe in a factsheet. sms invites will only be sent to parents or guardians of children who are 12 years old as of jun 1.  students whose 12th birthday fall after jun 1 will be invited for their vaccination at a later date, said moe. q: can i choose which vaccine i want to take?a: students below 18 will only be offered the pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccine, while those aged 18 and above can opt for either vaccine from pfizer-biontech or moderna, said the education ministry. for both vaccines, the interval between the first and second dose will be six to eight weeks. q: where can i get vaccinated?a: eligible students can get their jabs at community vaccination centres.  there will also be four dedicated moe vaccination centres set up at raffles city convention centre, ite college central, ite college east and ite college west, said moe. ite will arrange for their students to take their vaccinations on campus. each ite centre will have up to 1,600 vaccination slots per day, ""comparable"" to community vaccination centres, while raffles convention centre can take up to 2,000 slots per day, said moe in a briefing on monday. the ministry will also deploy mobile vaccination teams to special education schools to ""facilitate access"" for eligible students who may find it challenging to visit a vaccination centre. q: will parents be allowed to accompany their child to the vaccination centre?a: parents are required to accompany their child to the vaccination centre if they are below 13 years old. parents of students aged 13 and above are not required to be present.  should they choose to do so, however, they will be asked to wait at a family area outside the vaccination room to avoid congestion and ensure compliance with safe management measures. students in special education schools must also be accompanied by a parent or guardian. parental or guardian consent is also required for students below 18, as part of the booking process for the vaccination slots through the national appointment system, said moe.  consent given via the system will be collected once, and will apply for both doses of the vaccine. q: what happens if i miss my vaccination appointment? will i be allowed to make another appointment?a: students who miss their first vaccination appointment during the moe vaccination exercise will be able to reschedule when the vaccination is open to the public for their age bands, said the ministry in the factsheet. if students miss their second vaccination appointment, they should contact moh at 1800 333 9999 for further assistance. q: what if my vaccination appointment clashes with my upcoming oral national examinations?a: if students' upcoming oral national examination schedules clash with their appointment dates for the first or second dose of their vaccination, changes to their oral examination dates within the examination window can be accommodated where possible, said the education ministry. new appointment dates for the vaccination can also be scheduled. special consideration may be applicable if rescheduling is not possible, and parents or students should provide evidence of the vaccination appointment to facilitate this, said moe. downloadour appor subscribe to our telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:https://cna. asia/telegramit looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

""the risk of large-scale spread is extremely low,"" the nhc said, adding that the man was in a stable condition and his close contacts had reported no ""abnormalities"".  it described h10n3 as low pathogenic less likely to cause death or severe illness in birds. the man was stable and ready to be discharged from hospital.  medical observation of his close contacts had not found any other cases. the nhc said there had been no human cases of h10n3 previously reported in the world. h10n3 is a low pathogenic, or relatively less severe, strain of the virus in poultry and the risk of it spreading on a large scale was very low, the nhc added. the strain is ""not a very common virus"", said filip claes, regional laboratory coordinator of the food and agriculture organisation's emergency centre for transboundary animal diseases at the regional office for asia and the pacific. only around 160 isolates of the virus were reported in the 40 years to 2018, mostly in wild birds or waterfowl in asia and some limited parts of north america, and none had been detected in chickens so far, he added. analysing the genetic data of the virus will be necessary to determine whether it resembles older viruses or if it is a novel mix of different viruses, claes said. several strains of bird flu have been found among animals in china but mass outbreaks in humans are rare. the last human epidemic of bird flu in china occurred in late 2016 to 2017, with the h7n9 virus. the h7n9 has infected 1,668 people and claimed 616 lives since 2013, according to the united nations' food and agriculture organisation. following recent avian flu outbreaks in africa and eurasia, the head of china's centre for disease control and prevention last week urged stricter surveillance in poultry farms, markets and wild birds. covid-19 was first detected at a food and animal market in the central chinese city of wuhan in late 2019. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

""as we have now entered the warmer months of the year from june to october, the increased risk of higher dengue transmission is a concern,"" said the agency. the nea therefore expects an increasing number of dengue cases due to the accelerated breeding cycle and maturation of the aedes aegypti mosquito vectors meaning it takes less time for the mosquito to become a biting adult in warmer months as well as the shorter incubation period of the dengue virus. this refers to the time needed for the mosquito to pick up the disease and pass it on. according to the world health organisation, this period is around eight to 12 days when the temperature is 25 to 28 deg c. since the covid-19 phase two (heightened alert) measures kicked in on may 16, the nea said that more people staying in and working from home could mean more "" biting opportunities"" for the day-biting aedes aegypti mosquito, and potentially higher risk of dengue transmission. last august, a study examining the impact of the circuit breaker on the number of dengue infections found there were 50 per cent more cases than usual. the study, which was conducted in collaboration with the national university of singapore's saw swee hock school of public health, also found that adults aged 20 to 64 made up the majority of infections, since that part of the population would have normally been in the workplace during the day. in addition, more than half of the positive dengue samples since february were of the less common dengue serotypes 3 (denv-3) and 4 (denv-4). serotypes are distinct variations within a particular virus.  there are four dengue serotypes: denv-1, 2, 3 and 4.  the predominant dengue virus serotype in singapore has been denv-2 since 2016. the nea said that since denv-3 has not been dominant for about the last three decades and the incidence rate of denv-4 has also been consistently low, the population immunity for both serotypes is low, making people more likely to get infected. however, it added that it is too early to say that there has been a switch of dominant dengue virus serotype in singapore. the denv-3 serotype has been detected in the dengue cluster at cashew terrace and hazel park terrace, while denv-4 has been detected in clusters at hougang central and pasir ris street 21. ""if left unchecked, the high aedes aegypti mosquito population, coupled with the circulation of previously uncommon dengue virus serotypes and a sizeable proportion of people. . .  working from home, would add to the dengue risk this year,"" said the nea. it urged the public to prevent mosquito breeding by ensuring that stagnant water is removed. in the meantime, the nea will continue to conduct inspections in areas with higher mosquito population, and has stepped up its operations in dengue cluster areas. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

""despite its doomsday-defying role, it was built by a country that in 1950 was invaded by the neighbouring north, and pyongyang has since developed a nuclear and missile arsenal. the facility was built in the ""safest spot"" in south korea, mr lee said, and designed to withstand a 6. 9-magnitude earthquake and even an atomic strike. ""it's geographically very safe,"" he said.  ""and we paved a 46m-deep underground tunnel to ensure it's safe from war and nuclear threats. ""the world's biggest and best-known seed vault is buried deep inside a former coal mine in svalbard, a remote arctic norwegian archipelago around 1,300km from the north pole. dubbed the ""noah's ark"" of food crops, the global seed vault focuses on agricultural and related plants, storing more than one million seed samples from nearly every country on the planet. but researchers say preserving the seeds of wild plants the original source of the crops we eat today should not be overlooked.

many crop relatives in the wild that could provide genetic diversity to help long-term food security ""lack effective protection"", according to a recent united nations report. it warned that farming was likely to be less resilient against climate change, pests and pathogens as a result, adding: ""the biosphere, upon which humanity as a whole depends. . .  is declining faster than at any time in human history. ""wild plants hold promise as future medicines, fuels and food, said the royal botanic gardens in kew, london, in a report last year, but around two-fifths of them are threatened with extinction, largely due to habitat destruction and climate change. it was a ""race against time"" to identify them before they disappeared, it added. research on wild plant seeds is ""lacking tremendously"", said senior researcher na chae-sun at the baekdudaegan national arboretum.

2021-06-01,"Nestlé says over half of its traditional packaged food business is not 'healthy' in an internal presentation to top executives, according to a report.","the majority of nestlé's traditional food and drinks do not meet a ""recognised definition of health. ""just 37% of its consumer food and beverage products meet international health standards. the global food company acknowledged the issue in an internal presentation seen by the financial times. see more stories on insider's business page. more than 60% of nestlé's traditional packaged consumer food and beverage products do not meet an internationally recognized health standard, according to internal company documents seen by the financial times. ""some of our categories and products will never be 'healthy' no matter how much we renovate,"" the company said in a presentation seen by top executives at the world's largest food conglomerate. ceo mark schneider told bloomberg in september that the company is making continued investments in the healthiness of its products, but ""confectionary and chocolate address a deep human need and are going to be here to stay. ""the definition of ""healthy"" comes from the australian health star rating system, which scores products on a five-star scale and is used by international researchers including the access to nutrition foundation.  a product must score at least 3. 5 stars to be considered healthy. metrics like the health star system ""enable consumers to make informed choices.  however, they don't capture everything,"" a company spokesperson said in a statement to insider.  ""about half of our sales are not covered by these systems.  that includes categories such as infant nutrition, specialized health products and pet food, which follow regulated nutrition standards. """"we believe that a healthy diet means finding a balance between well-being and enjoyment.  this includes having some space for indulgent foods, consumed in moderation,"" the spokesperson added. the presentation highlighted the stats of some of the most unhealthy products made and sold by nestlé-owned brands. a serving of hot pockets pepperoni pizza packs a whopping 48 percent of the daily sodium allowance, followed closely by digiorno's three meat croissant crust pizza, which has 40 percent.  to pair saltiness with sweetness, nestlé also offers an orange-flavored san pellegrino drink with 7. 1g of sugar per 100ml, and nesquik's strawberry-flavored milk powder with 14g of sugar in a 14g serving. ""strawberry nesquik is perfect at breakfast to get kids ready for the day,"" nestlé says in its marketing text for the product. ""we have made significant improvements to our products . . .  [but] our portfolio still underperforms against external definitions of health in a landscape where regulatory pressure and consumer demands are skyrocketing,"" the presentation said. professor marion nestle (no relation), who researches nutritional science at cornell, told the ft that a healthy portfolio is likely out of reach for large publicly traded companies like nestlé. ""food companies' job is to generate money for stockholders, and to generate it as quickly and in as large an amount as possible,"" she said.  ""they are going to sell products that reach a mass audience and are bought by as many people as possible, that people want to buy, and that's junk food. """"nestlé is a very smart company, at least from my meetings with people who are in their science [departments] . . .  but they have a real problem,"" she added.

""this will tear apart our country brick by brick until our house collapses on us"", bennett said. ""mr.  netanyahu is not trying to form a right wing government.  he knows it's impossible.  he wants to take the country to his own personal masada,"" bennett said.  he said netanyahu was operating a ""well-oiled machine that is spreading lies to sow fear in the public. ""bennett stressed the new unity government will not be left-wing, and that it wouldn't give up territories or hesitate to go on a military operation if one is needed. ""the left wing part of the government made big compromises . . .  each side of the government will have a veto power and equal number of votes"", bennett said. the other side: netanyahu gave a statement shortly after bennett's speech, calling him a liar and ""the con artist of the century. "" he called on right wing voters to put pressure on the members of knesset from bennett's party so that they don't vote in favor of the new government. worth noting: under a ""change government,"" bennett would serve as prime minister for two years before lapid rotates into the job.  it would be the most wide-ranging coalition ever formed in israel. what's next: bennett's and lapid's negotiations teams convened right after the speech.  lapid and bennett were already on the verge of a deal three weeks ago when talks suspended over the gaza operation. both of them want to finish negotiations by monday or tuesday, and notify president rivlin that they managed to form a government.  the swearing in of the government could take place no more than a week later. more from axios: sign up to get the latest market trends with axios markets.  subscribe for freehk$0,hk$10,000 apple store. . . step aside, heat tools. rangers who keep an eye on north america's highest mountain peak say impatient and inexperienced climbers are taking more risks and endangering themselves and other climbers after a year off because of the covid-19 pandemic.   denali in southern alaska is 20,310 feet (6,190 meters) above sea level and requires a level of expertise and acclimation to high altitudes not needed for climbing most peaks in the u. s.

his victims' relatives.  giovanni brusca, 64, a former leader of cosa nostra, was released from a high security jail in rome after spending 25 years behind bars for multiple murders and mafia association.  he was notorious for having detonated the huge roadside bomb that blew up a crusading anti-mafia prosecutor, giovanni falcone, in 1992.  brusca told a court how he sat on the side of a hill, watching the progress of the prosecutor's convoy through a pair of binoculars, before activating the explosion by remote control.  the prosecutor's wife and three police protection officers also died in the massive explosion, which happened on a stretch of motorway outside palermo.  brusca ordered the kidnapping of 12-year-old giuseppe di matteo in revenge for the boy's father deciding to become a pentito or informant, offering to collaborate with police and prosecutors.  the boy was kidnapped, held in squalid and inhuman conditions for more than two years, then strangled and dissolved

""we are working with malaysia to ensure the continued flow of essential supplies between our two countries,"" said mr gan, speaking at a covid-19 multi-ministry task force. the government has been working closely with relevant agencies and companies to build up existing stock, further diversify its sources of food and essential items while also increasing local production, he said. ""i want to assure everyone that we have ample supply of food and essential items.  but please remember to only buy what you need,"" said mr gan, who is also co-chair of the task force. economic agencies in singapore are working with companies, especially those dealing with essential goods and services, to minimise disruptions to their supply lines, he added. mr gan visited supermarket chain fairprice and home-grown supply chain solutions company ych over the weekend to better understand the measures that have been put in place to ensure that there is sufficient food and essential items for all, he said. describing the covid-19 situation as ""extremely fluid"", mr gan said that as the pandemic continues to evolve globally, singapore must remain prepared and vigilant as a nation while staying flexible and adaptable. speaking after prime minister lee hsien loong's address on singapore's strategy against covid-19, mr gan said that the next few months are ""critical"".

""the impact of the measures will differ across different sectors.  domestic, consumer-oriented sectors, such as food and beverage services, retail, and land transport, will see a greater impact,"" he added. ""on the other hand, the impact of these measures on outward-oriented sectors of the economy, such as manufacturing and finance and insurance, is likely to be less severe. ""last friday, finance minister lawrence wong announcedmore support measuresfor businesses affected by the tightened measures, extending wage subsidies to more sectors.

2021-06-01,"Protection from Harassment Court to be established on Jun 1 to make it easier, faster for victims to obtain relief.","singapore: singapore will establish the protection from harassment court on jun 1, which will allow for easier and faster processing of relief for harassment victims, according to a joint release issued by the ministry of law and the state courts on monday (may 31). the new specialised court will hear all criminal and civil matters under the protection from harassment act (poha) and will adopt a simplified process for certain types of applications, including those for protection orders and orders relating to falsehoods. under the simplified track, a claimant can file a claim online and at lower cost through the state courts'community justice and tribunals systemthat is accessible 24/7. this is as opposed to the current process, which requires travelling to filing bureaus to file an originating summons with a supporting affidavit in-person, said the authorities. the system also offers a pre-filing assessment for people to assess the validity of their claims. claims that can be made under the simplified track must involve only one claimant and no more than five respondents, be brought within two years from the date that the course of action is accrued, and not include a claim for damages above s$20,000. hearings will also be conducted more quickly under the new court, which will target to conduct hearings for expedited protection orders within 48 to 72 hours of the application. this target is reduced to within 24 hours where there is a ""risk of violence or actual violence"", said the authorities. the court will aim to hear protection orders within four weeks of the application. respondents can also initiate an ""enegotiation"" process on the system to try and reach an amicable settlement with a claimant, said the authorities. cases in the protection from harassment court may be transferred to other courts, and vice versa. ""this transfer mechanism recognises how harassment may occur against the backdrop of other ongoing proceedings, such as divorce proceedings,"" said the authorities. from jun 1, cases may be transferred between the protection from harassment court and district court or magistrate's court.  transfers with the family court will be operationalised at a later date. enhanced protectionseveral changes to enhance protection for victims of harassment will also come into effect on jun 1. firstly, victims will face fewer hurdles to obtain protection orders.  if a respondent has been convicted of any poha or hurt-related offence against the victim, the requirement to show that a poha provision has been contravened – which is necessary before a protection order can be granted – will be ""deemed satisfied"". ""victims will not have to relive their experience more than necessary, to obtain protection,"" said the authorities. secondly, judges granting expedited protection orders will be required to consider whether a criminal investigation is warranted, and if so, to refer cases to the police for investigation. people who have breached protection orders or expedited protection orders can also be arrested in prescribed scenarios, such as where hurt is caused. these changes are being introduced because in egregious cases of hurt or harassment, it may not be enough to grant the victim a civil remedy, said the authorities. thirdly, protection orders and expedited protection orders will be further extended to protect people related to the victim, as they may also be harassed by the same perpetrator. it will also be made clear that domestic exclusion orders – which restrain the perpetrator from entering the victim's residence or parts of the residence – can be granted as part of a protection order. this will ensure better protection for victims who may stay in the same residence as the harasser, said the authorities. the establishment of the protection from harassment court and the other amendments are provided for under the protection from harassment (amendment) bill 2019 passed by parliament in may 2019. minister for law k shanmugam said at the time the changes to the law were a ""crucial step"". ""the message is clear: it is unacceptable for perpetrators, the penalties are increased, toughened, the legal framework is even stricter, so even if it's a civil order, protection order, if you breach it, the police will come after you.  it's an absolute no-no, not acceptable,"" mr shanmugam had said. ""for the victims, it's both that the law will protect you . . .  but also that we have to increase awareness, we have to make them understand that they don't need to be in such relationships, that they can walk out, that there is a system that will protect them.

2021-06-01,Hong Kong's 'Grandma Wong' arrested for solo Tiananmen protest.,"hong kong: hong kong police have arrested an elderly democracy activist as she made a solo demonstration over china's deadly tiananmen crackdown in a vivid illustration of the zero protest tolerance now wielded by authorities in the financial hub. alexandra wong, 65, was detained on sunday (may 30) on suspicion of taking part in an unlawful assembly as she walked towards beijing's liaison office in hong kong. wong known locally as ""grandma wong"" was a regular fixture of the huge democracy protests that swept hong kong in 2019. she could often be seen waving a union jack flag, a symbol of her dissatisfaction with beijing's rule since the city was handed to china by former colonial power britain in 1997. protest is now all but outlawed in hong kong. authorities have used both the threat of the coronavirus and security concerns to ban demonstrations. a vigil planned for this friday the 32nd anniversary of beijing's 1989 crackdown on democracy protests in tiananmen square has beendenied permission for the second year in a row. authorities have cited the coronavirus, although hong kong is currently celebrating no local transmission cases of unknown origin for the last month. activists had also sought permission for a small tiananmen-themed march on sunday to the liaison office, which represents the central government in the city, but it was also denied permission. wong turned up anyway that afternoon holding as sign that read ""32, june 4, tiananmen's lament"" and a yellow umbrella the latter a symbol of hong kong's democracy movement. the south china morning post said the pensioner started chanting slogans in a park before heading towards the liaison office by herself, while being followed and filmed by police. she was stopped twice. ""i'm only by myself, just an old lady here.  why stop me?"" the post quoted wong as telling officers. soon afterwards she was arrested. police confirmed a 65-year-old woman surnamed wong had been arrested for ""knowingly participating in an unauthorised assembly and attempting to incite others to join an unauthorised assembly"". hong kong's democracy movement has been crushed by a broad crackdown on dissent over the last year, including the imposition of a sweeping security law that criminalises much dissent. in the middle of the 2019 protests wong disappeared for more than a year. she resurfaced saying she had been detained by mainland authorities during a trip to shenzhen, a neighbouring city where she lived at the time. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-06-01,"Last resort: Seeds from nearly 5,000 wild plant species kept safe in a South Korean mountain.","bonghwa, south korea: hidden in a south korean mountain tunnel designed to withstand a nuclear blast, the seeds of nearly 5,000 wild plant species are stored for safekeeping against climate change, natural disaster and war. plant extinction is progressing at an alarming rate, researchers warn, driven by increasing human population, pollution and deforestation, even before many species are catalogued. the baekdudaegan national arboretum seed vault centre preserves nearly 100,000 seeds from 4,751 different wild plant species to ensure they are not lost to ""apocalyptic events"", says its head lee sang-yong. it is one of only two such facilities in the world, he told afp: unlike more commonplace seed banks, where samples are stored and regularly withdrawn for various purposes, deposits in seed vaults are meant to be permanent, with use intended only as a last resort to prevent extinction. the vault is designated as a security installation by south korea's national intelligence service, surrounded by wire fences and dozens of cameras, with restrictions on filming in place and police patrolling on a regular basis. inside, a lift leads about eight floors down to a cavernous concrete tunnel, where two heavy steel doors guard the storage room and its hand-cranked shelving racks, kept at minus 20 degrees celsius to preserve the seeds and 40 per cent humidity to keep them viable. the vault's samples are largely of flora from the korean peninsula, but with a capacity of 2 million seeds, the south makes its space available to other countries, with kazakhstan and tajikistan among those to have taken up the offer. depositors retain ownership of their samples and control over withdrawals. but lee pointed out: ""the seed vault stores seeds to prevent their extinction, so the best scenario would be that the seeds never have to be taken out. ""despite its doomsday-defying role, it was built by a country that in 1950 was invaded by the neighbouring north, and pyongyang has since developed a nuclear and missile arsenal. the facility was built in the ""safest spot"" in south korea, lee said, designed to withstand a 6. 9-magnitude earthquake and even an atomic strike. ""it's geographically very safe,"" lee said.  ""and we paved a 46m-deep underground tunnel to ensure it's safe from war and nuclear threats. """"race against time""the world's biggest and best-known seed vault is buried deep inside a former coal mine on svalbard, a remote arctic norwegian archipelago about 1,300km from the north pole. dubbed the ""noah's ark"" of food crops, the global seed vault focuses on agricultural and related plants, storing more than one million seed samples from nearly every country on the planet. but researchers say preserving the seeds of wild plants the original source of the crops we eat today should not be overlooked. many crop relatives in the wild that could provide genetic diversity to help long-term food security ""lack effective protection"", according to a recent un report. it warned that farming was likely to be less resilient against climate change, pests and pathogens as a result, adding: ""the biosphere, upon which humanity as a whole depends . . .  is declining faster than at any time in human history. ""wild plants hold promise as future medicines, fuels and food, said the royal botanic gardens kew in a report last year, but around two-fifths of them are threatened with extinction, largely due to habitat destruction and climate change. it was a ""race against time"" to identify them before they disappeared, it added. research on wild plant seeds is ""lacking tremendously"", said na chae-sun, a senior researcher at the baekdudaegan national arboretum. she and her team collect samples and carry out a meticulous and extensive process including x-ray tests and trial plantations before seeds are catalogued and stored in the seed vault.

""following an interview with the said staff (member), the madrasah made a police report on the unauthorised transfer of the madrasah's confidential documents to third parties,"" said muis. the police confirmed to the straits times that a report was lodged and that they are looking into the matter. the council said the staff member has resigned from madrasah irsyad with immediate effect and that the school will not be able to provide further details, given that the matter is under police investigation. it added that the stolen documents are linked to an ongoing review of the madrasah's financial transactions. muis reiterated that ""it takes any allegations of financial irregularities very seriously and is undertaking the necessary steps to look into the matter"". the review had been stated in a parliamentary reply on april 5 by minister-in-charge of muslim affairs masagos zulkifli, who was responding to mr faisal manap of the workers' party. mr faisal, an mp for aljunied grc, had then asked, among other things, for details on any links between madrasah irsyad and irsyad trust limited (itl), and if any investigations were conducted in 2019 and 2020 regarding allegations of abuse of power in the madrasah. the allegations were regarding a former senior director of madrasah at muis, who had also been chief executive of itl since 2014. mr faisal had asked if the financial reports for both these bodies had been made public, and if there had been any transfer of funds from the madrasah to itl. mr masagos had answered then that there was no affiliation between itl and madrasah irsyad, and that the two had not been affiliated with each other since january. itl was established as a separate company in 2006 by the madrasah's management committee, under the name irsyad foundation limited. in august 2008, muis brought madrasah irsyad into its joint madrasah system, but the school's management continued to oversee its fund-raising efforts, including international projects in training and education.  funds raised from these projects went towards supporting madrasah irsyad's local operations. in 2014, madrasah irsyad's management moved the international side of its fund-raising efforts to itl. during a 2016 audit of madrasah irsyad's accounts, however, it was discovered that the school's management had endorsed a transfer of $2 million to itl for its international operations. ""muis requested itl to repay the monies to the madrasah.  itl returned the $2 million in full to the madrasah in 2016,"" said mr masagos. he added that after a review last year, madrasah irsyad decided to de-prioritise its international projects.  both the school and itl agreed that they would no longer be affiliated with each other from january this year, which meant that itl could no longer use the school's branding for its international projects. muis then asked for a review of the financial transactions between madrasah irsyad and itl, which is ongoing, and will consider further actions based on the findings of the review. the minister said that while muis had conducted an internal investigation into madrasah irsyad staff after a complaint, it was not linked to itl or the former muis senior director, who resigned in 2016. he added that while it was not muis' practice for religious schools to publish their financial statements, each school is required to submit them to muis for final audit purposes. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-06-01,"Higher risk of dengue transmission as Aedes mosquito population growing islandwide, says NEA.","singapore: the national environment agency (nea) is expecting an increasing number of dengue cases as singapore enters the warmer months of the year. this is due to the accelerated breeding and maturation of the aedes aegypti mosquito and shorter incubation period of the dengue virus, the agency said on tuesday (jun 1). the increasing population of the aedes mosquito across the island is also significant, it said. more than 2,700 dengue cases have been reported in singapore since the start of the year.  there are currently 22 active dengue clusters. while recent weekly dengue cases have been lower than in the same period last year, when singapore experienced a""historic"" outbreak, the figures are still higher than those reported in 2017 and 2018, said nea. the population of the aedes mosquito grew by about 30 per cent in april compared to january, said the agency. the population remains high in areas including:- clementi west street 1;- hougang avenues 10, 6 and 8;- jurong east avenue 1 and jurong east street 32; and- mei chin road, mei ling street and stirling road. ""if left unchecked, the current high aedes aegypti mosquito population, coupled with the circulation of previously uncommon dengue virus serotypes and a sizeable proportion of people staying in and working from home, would add to the dengue risk this year,"" said nea. lower immunity and ""biting opportunities""nea highlighted that dengue cases caused by the less common virus serotypes denv-3 and denv-4 made up more than half the serotypes sampled since february. ""denv-3 has not been dominant since about three decades ago, and the incidence of denv-4 has been consistently low. ""thus the population immunity for denv-3 and denv-4 is low, and more people are susceptible to transmission of the virus,"" said the agency. denv-3 has been detected in the dengue cluster at cashew terrace/hazel park terrace, while denv-4 has been detected in clusters at hougang central and pasir ris street 21, it said. the agency also noted that more people are staying in and working at home during phase 2 (heightened alert) of singapore's covid-19 prevention efforts, due to last until jun 13. this could translate into more ""biting opportunities"" for the day-biting aedes mosquito, potentially increasing the risk of dengue transmission, it said. the agency cited a study that found almost 50 per cent more dengue infections were reported during singapore's ""circuit breaker"" last year than there should have been, based on mathematical modelling. ""most of the excess infections were among adults of working age (20 to 64 years old) – people who would normally have been in workplaces, some of which would have been air-conditioned, instead of their homes,"" said nea. the agency carried out the epidemiological study with the national university of singapore saw swee hock school of public health in august last year. nea urged members of the public to remain vigilant and take steps to prevent mosquito breeding. the agency said it continues to conduct targeted inspections at areas with higher mosquito populations and has stepped up operations at dengue clusters. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-06-01,"Employer's family of 12 put under quarantine after maid tests positive for Covid-19 despite early SHN release, Singapore News & Top Stories.","read 3 articles daily and stand to win st rewards, including the st news tablet worth $398. spin the wheel for st read and win now. singapore when a hotel worker hired a new maid to care for her elderly parents, she did not think it would lead to a covid-19 scare and quarantine for her family of 12. the indonesian maid, who arrived here on april 15, was discharged from stay-home notice (shn) only five days later, despite testing positive for her polymerase chain reaction (pcr) test. the employer, who wanted to be known only as ms lee, 32, was worried if the maid's early discharge was safe, so she checked with the isolation facility where the helper was quarantined. she was told not to worry because the helper's serology test came back positive, indicating that it was a past infection. her worst fears came true when the maid was retested and the results were positive an issue that came to light last week when former dj jade rasif said in a social media post that she had a similar experience. in ms lee's case, the helper arrived on april 21 at her home, where ms lee lives with her two elderly parents and her brother. two weeks later, on may 4, the helper tested positive in a mandatory swab test.  an ambulance took her to the national centre for infectious diseases (ncid). she was among several maids who had been released early from shn, only to test positive again a few weeks later.  since feb 5, maids and confinement nannies coming into singapore have had to do compulsory serology tests in addition to pcr tests. those who test positive for antibodies in their serology test are classified as recovered patients and can be released from shn. however, some of these maids were called back for swab tests over the past month, according to several maid agencies the straits times spoke to.  some then tested positive and were put in isolation. on may 16, ms rasif said in facebook and instagram posts that her helper tested positive for covid-19 after being released early from shn.  the manpower ministry (mom) has since clarified that the helper was not infectious and was shedding dead viral fragments. mr steve siva, director of maid agency unistarr employment, said the issue has raised concerns among employers and maids.  he said: ""we didn't expect domestic workers could still be potential covid-19 cases, as our understanding was that they were cleared. employers also have suffered.  ms lee's troubles began when her helper was first taken to ncid on may 4.  ""it was a shock, and it sent us all into confusion and panic because we didn't know what would happen, whether we needed to be quarantined.  nobody told us anything,"" she said. her two sisters and their families of four had also come into contact with the helper when they visited for a family dinner.  all of them decided to self-quarantine. the next day, ms lee received an e-mail that informed her that the helper was a suspected positive covid-19 case, but she and her family could continue their daily activities.  the helper then tested negative twice in a row. on may 8, after the maid was swabbed again, moh called ms lee to inform her that all 12 of them had to be under quarantine. ms lee said: ""we were speechless at this point.  we thought it was safe to go about our daily lives, and had met so many people at work and school. . .  we were also worried for the safety of our parents, who have chronic illnesses. ""ms lee and her family have finished their quarantine and cleared all their swab tests, but the maid's status remains unclear. she was discharged last tuesday after completing 21 days of isolation, with a memo that said she was no longer infectious.  however, ms lee said when she spoke to an moh doctor on may 21, she was told it was still unclear if the maid had been reinfected. she said: ""it's making us very jittery. . .  she went through multiple swab and blood tests, and we just find it unbelievable that there isn't anything on her infection status. ""another employer, rachel (not her real name), 55, said the maid she employs was taken away on may 2 after testing positive for covid-19 not knowing whether her family was safe and when the maid could return. she earlier got a call from the authorities and was told the maid had tested positive but that rachel and her family were not under quarantine. rachel, who did not want to be named to avoid causing alarm at the daycare facility her father visits, said: ""i was so frightened and sceptical because it was just over the phone. ""over the next three days, she worked from home and stopped sending her father to daycare.  she also called the moh hotline, but the officer could not provide any more details about the helper's status. rachel then received an e-mail from mom on may 5 that informed her that the maid was a ""positive suspect"", and that rachel could go about her daily activities.  she was allowed home on may 9 after it was confirmed she was not infected. rachel said the whole experience was frustrating because of the lack of information.  ""they took her away, and i was in the dark until they e-mailed me three days later, but in between, i couldn't do anything.

2021-06-01,Israel's 'magician' Netanyahu faces final curtain after record run.,"by jeffrey hellerjerusalem (reuters) long the familiar face of israel, benjamin netanyahu has held on as prime minister for more than a decade, clinging to power through a criminal indictment and four elections in the past two years alone. now, the question is whether the 71-year-old netanyahu, dubbed ""the magician"" by his admirers, has any cards left up his sleeve. after years in which he exerted near-complete hegemony over israeli politics, an emerging broad coalition of opponents could be about to unseat him. ""fraud of the century,"" an indignant netanyahu declared on sunday, after fellow right-winger naftali bennett turned against him and opted to align with centrist opposition chief yair lapid despite a public promise that he wouldn't. and while netanyahu's likud party has remained unflinchingly loyal to him, gideon saar, a disillusioned likud defector, is in line to join the new government-in-making as head of his own new horizon party. israeli political commentators said the political knives have been out for a while for netanyahu, the country's longest-serving leader. a sense that he was living on borrowed time after 12 consecutive years in office was compounded by a corruption trial now under way. the cases involve alleged favours to media tycoons and illegal receipt of expensive cigars and champagne.  netanyahu has denied all wrongdoing and says, without offering any evidence, that he is a victim of a deep state conspiracy against him. don't count him out yet, political commentators warn. ""it's still too early to declare that (the) ""bibi era"" of israeli politics has ended.  but if change is ultimately achieved, netanyahu will have been toppled by his colleagues on the right, who had it with his leadership,"" aluf benn, editor of the left-wing haaretz newspaper, wrote on monday. gracious in defeat?popularly known by his childhood nickname, bibi, netanyahu is the son of a historian and attended high school and college in the united states, where his father taught. never lost for a soundbite, his booming baritone hasresounded on the world stage since serving as israel's ambassador to the united nations from 1984 to 1988.  entering politics in israel as a likud legislator, he became party leader in 1993. netanyahu last lost the premiership, in his first term, before the turn of the millennium. his gracious handover after a 1999 election to then-labour party leader ehud barak would seem almost impossible today, in the context of netanyahu's frequent social media sniping against his rivals. at a changing of the guard in the prime minister's office, netanyahu and his wife sara smiled as they shook hands with barak and his spouse and chatted amiably with the couple with a glass of wine in their hands. this time around, if lapid meets a wednesday deadline to form a new government with bennett slated to go first as prime minister in a ""rotation"" deal netanyahu will likely be ready to pounce as leader of the opposition. in a possible taste of things to come, a stern-looking netanyahu went on television on monday to decry the creation of a ""dangerous, left-wing government"". the tone of his remarks like ""fraud of the century"" has unavoidable echoes of his closest international ally, himself now unseated, former u. s.  president donald trump. the diverse composition of an alliance of left-wing, centrist and right-wing parties would make it particularly unstable in a country so riven by political divisions that ""do-over"" elections have become the norm. but for netanyahu's loyalist voters, popularly dubbed ""bibists"", he remains a leader tough on security and a bulwark against pressure, even from trump's successor president joe biden, for any bold steps that could lead to a palestinian state. pro-netanyahu sentiment was still alive in southern israel this month, even as the area again came under intensive rocket attack from hamas in gaza. ""thank goodness we have a strong prime minister, bibi netanyahu,"" one resident said, without a hint of sarcasm, on israeli tv as he stood outside his parent's home after it was hit for a second time by a rocket during 11 days of fighting.

Only a global effort can tame COVID-19.","india has been witnessing an unprecedented surge in covid-19 cases, largely due to the new variants.  the variant found initially in the united kingdom (b. 1. 1. 7) was found in parts of north india earlier this year and began to spread across the country.  the world health organisation (who) recently declared the variant first found in india (b. 1. 617) as a variant of global concern as it has already spread to more than 40 countries.  this underscores the fact that no one is safe until everyone is safe.  it calls for globally coordinated efforts to build herd immunity through mass vaccination and to develop new vaccines or tweak the existing ones to become effective against the new variants.  experts have been doubtful about the effectiveness of some of the covid-19 vaccines against the new variants of the virus. an immediate outcome of the second wave in india is that many people are no longer hesitant to take the vaccine.  however, vaccine shortages have been reported in many parts of the country.  several people have criticised the government's vaccine maitri policy.  the government has already imposed temporary restrictions on the export of covid-19 vaccines from india.  although there is a need for these temporary restrictions to meet domestic demand, any definite move towards vaccine nationalism will be detrimental to global efforts to contain the virus.  the pandemic needs to be checked globally in a coordinated manner.  if this is not done, the virus will keep mutating and no country will remain isolated.  
only way to decrease variants of covid-19 is by increasing vaccination, says dr.  gagandeep kang
from may 1, all those aged 18 and above became eligible in india to receive the covid-19 vaccines.  this means that 595 million people who require 1,190 million doses were added to the 344 million people in the 45 and above age group requiring 688 million doses.  inoculating this huge population calls for massive production capacities.  only a little over 12% of the population has received one dose and 3. 2% has received both the doses in india so far. the current production capacity of covishield and covaxin is just over 70 million doses per month.  the government has allocated ₹45 billion as an advance commitment to serum institute of india and bharat biotech for enhancing their production capacity.  by june-july, in the best-case scenario, the combined production capacity of the two companies is expected to rise to 158 million doses per month.  the 50 million imported sputnik doses will add to this.  this vaccine will be available only in major private hospitals for now.  it is reported that the sputnik vaccine will be produced in india from july with an annual capacity of 156 million doses, which, according to the russian ambassador to india, will be gradually increased to 850 million doses.  even if all the three vaccines are exclusively used for domestic supply, the anticipated production in the near future will not be sufficient to meet the enormous vaccine demand. being the pharmacy of the world, india needs to rise to the occasion and cater to the demand for vaccines in the country as well as facilitate inoculation of the global population, especially in poorer countries.  in the first week of may, the indian council of medical research said it was willing to share the know-how to produce covaxin with any company interested in production.  allowing multiple producers will lead to more competition and a reduction in prices.  the government can easily task the public sector vaccine manufacturers with the production of covaxin by providing support to them.  in its attempt to enhance the production of covaxin from 12. 5 million doses to 58 million doses a month, the government of india has involved three public sector enterprises — haffkine biopharmaceutical corporation, bharat immunologicals and biologicals corporation limited, and indian immunologicals limited.   
nobel laureate's claim on variants | experts seek to dispel vaccine fears
while raising an alarm on the spread of infectious diseases, a 2020 report of the who on the urgent health challenges for the next decade expressed concern on the lack of access to medical products, including medicines and vaccines.  as infectious diseases are expected to increase in the coming years, india needs to frame a long-term strategy to enhance supply at the domestic and international level.  public sector enterprises should be an integral part of that strategy.  unfortunately, the public sector enterprise policy, released in february, has not identified public sector enterprises in the pharmaceuticals sector as strategically important, and therefore, all central public sector enterprises will subsequently be privatised. what we need now is the mass production of covid-19 vaccines for the mass vaccination of the global population in order for us to develop herd immunity against the virus.  india still has options left for scaling up production.  the national health profile 2019, published by the central bureau of health intelligence, ministry of health and family welfare, shows that india has an installed capacity of 8,151. 7 million doses of vaccines annually, in the private and public sectors.  a few of these facilities can be re-purposed for the production of covid-19 vaccines. scaling up production of existing vaccines and producing new vaccines is not easy.  unavailability of raw materials, complexities in the transfer of technology, and intellectual property barriers all hinder production.  serum institute and bharat biotech have faced constraints in continuing production due to the lack of raw materials.   
vaccination is our only weapon

(b.', '1.', '617) as a variant of global concern as it has already spread to more than 40 countries.', 'this underscores the fact that no one is safe until everyone is safe.', 'it calls for globally coordinated efforts to build herd immunity through mass vaccination and to develop new vaccines or tweak the existing ones to become effective against the new variants.', 'experts have been doubtful about the effectiveness of some of the covid-19 vaccines against the new variants of the virus.', 'an immediate outcome of the second wave in india is that many people are no longer hesitant to take

be produced in india from july with an annual capacity of 156 million doses, which, according to the russian ambassador to india, will be gradually increased to 850 million doses.', 'even if all the three vaccines are exclusively used for domestic supply, the anticipated production in the near future will not be sufficient to meet the enormous vaccine demand.', 'being the pharmacy of the world, india needs to rise to the occasion and cater to the demand for vaccines in the country as well as facilitate inoculation of the global population, especially in poorer countries.', 'in the first week of may, the indian council of medical research said it was willing to share the know-how to produce covaxin with any company interested in production.', 'allowing multiple producers will lead to more

""""sota does not condone harassment or abuse of any sort, whether online or offline, by or against any member of staff or student,"" the school said.  they explained that reports made to the school would be looked into and punitive action taken once criteria is met and those who wish to lodge a report can submit it to whistleblow@sota. edu. sg.  ""all reports will be treated with utmost seriousness, respect and confidentiality,"" they said. police told media that they are looking into the matter and that someone has lodged a police report against the account.  they did not comment further on the report's details. publication of identifying information about an individual on the internet with malicious intent, known as doxxing is considered an offence.  currently, media has not been able to verify who is running the account durian. dot as the creator or creators insisted on being anonymous. but, in one instagram post, they said they had ""weighed the pros and cons, coming to the conclusion that it is more important to highlight these behaviours than to continue to keep mum"". last week, when the instagram account was live, some posts were removed either because the contributor was suspected of trolling or the the person involved had ""taken necessary action to avoid repeating same behaviours"".  also read: ngee ann poly suspends student union activities as allegations of toxic behaviour mount on social mediain one post, the account durian. dot said they were ""aware that this is considered doxxing and we can get reported. . .  for most cases, we have sufficient evidence on our end to work alongside the police, but we are not posting them in order to protect the victims' identities"". ""for other cases, they may not be compelling due to the lack of evidence, so raising awareness is the next best bet.  our society normalises abuse much more than speaking up.

2021-06-01,"Pregnant women, cancer patients on active treatment can get Covid-19 jabs, Health News & Top Stories.","read 3 articles daily and stand to win st rewards, including the st news tablet worth $398. spin the wheel for st read and win now. singapore pregnant women and cancer patients on active treatment are among the sub-groups of individuals that can also be vaccinated, said the multi-ministry task force (mtf) in an update on monday (may 31). the task force noted that more people have been vaccinated both globally and locally, providing more evidence on the efficacy and safety of vaccine use. this is especially in relation to specific sub-groups where clinical trial data had not been as substantive. health minister ong ye kung said: ""we can now be more inclusive in administering vaccinations.  since the start of the vaccination exercise, a few sub-groups have not been included, mostly because of medical reasons. ""but the expert committee on covid-19 vaccination has reviewed global and local data relating to these sub-groups and is satisfied that vaccination is safe and efficacious for many of them, he added.  pregnant women will be able to register and book a vaccination appointment from friday if they are part of the population group eligible for vaccination. but mtf added that they should discuss the risks and benefits with their doctors to make an informed decision on the vaccination. singapore's director of medical services, associate professor kenneth mak, said this applies irrespective of a woman's stage of pregnancy.  if a woman becomes pregnant after getting her first dose, she can proceed with the second as well.  ""there is currently no evidence to suggest that the pfizer-biontech or moderna covid-19 vaccines may cause harm to pregnant women or their babies,"" mtf said. ""however, the committee recognises that the amount of data collected on this population segment is still much smaller compared to data on the general population. ""it added that it is also safe for women who are breastfeeding to be vaccinated and they do not have to suspend breastfeeding to receive the vaccine. meanwhile, cancer patients on active treatment can also be vaccinated, mtf said.  but they should do so in a hospital setting, after assessment by their treating specialists on their suitability. active treatment includes chemotherapy, immunotherapy or radiation therapy that individuals have undergone in the past three months or plan to undergo in the next two months. under the current guidelines, cancer patients on hormonal therapy can continue to be vaccinated at any available vaccination site. mtf said: ""cancer patients on active cancer treatment remain a vulnerable population that is at an increased risk of complications from covid-19. ""there is currently no evidence of any safety signals or increased rates of adverse events from mrna-based covid-19 vaccines for this group. ""the expert committee is also finalising guidelines on vaccination for cancer patients on treatment, including those who consult private specialists. additionally, those with severe cutaneous adverse reactions, which are rare drug-induced disorders, can also receive the vaccine. such reactions include the stevens-johnson syndrome a rare, serious disorder of the skin and mucous membranes; toxic epidermal necrolysis a reaction where the skin blisters and peels, and can be life threatening; and severe hypersensitivity and rash. these people may go to the vaccination centres, if they are part of the population group that is eligible. mtf said the committee is also reviewing the safety data on people with a history of anaphylaxis, which is a severe allergic reaction that can kill unless treated promptly, to allow more to be safely vaccinated.  the review aims to be completed in the next two weeks and will set out guidelines. mr ong said: ""specifically, the committee is reviewing the restriction for those who are not allergic to the mrna vaccine or its components, but to other substances like seafood, painkillers, antibiotics. ""he added that the review will take about two weeks with the intention of removing these restrictions and allowing more individuals in this group to be eligible for vaccination.  ""this is quite a sizeable group of over 30,000 individuals.  so the lifting of these restrictions will be a fairly meaningful one.

2021-06-01,WHO chief backs ‘pandemic treaty’ to counter future outbreaks.,"the un health agency's director-general tedros adhanom ghebreyesus says the 'time has come' for a global pandemic treaty. the head of the world health organization has called for speedily launching global negotiations to agree on an international treaty on pandemic preparedness, as part of sweeping reforms envisioned by member states. tedros adhanom ghebreyesus, who director-general, told its annual ministerial assembly on monday that the united nations health agency faced a ""serious challenge"" to maintain its covid-19 response at the current level and required sustainable and flexible funding. earlier in the day, health ministers agreed to study recommendations for ambitious reforms made by independent experts to strengthen the capacity of both the who and countries to contain new viruses. the ministers from the who's 194 member states will meet from november 29 to decide whether to launch negotiations on the pandemic treaty. ""the one recommendation i believe will do the most to strengthen who and global health security is the recommendation of a treaty on pandemic preparedness and response which could also strengthen relations between member states and foster cooperation.  this is an idea whose time has come,"" tedros said. in his closing remarks at the who's virtual annual health assembly, tedros said the ""lack of sharing of data, information, pathogens, technologies and resources"" was a defining characteristic of the pandemic. ""a [pandemic] treaty would foster improved sharing, trust and accountability, and provide the solid foundation on which to build other mechanisms for global health security. ""only two international treaties have previously been negotiated under the auspices of the who in its 73-year history: the framework convention on tobacco control in 2003 and the international health regulations in 2005. the coronavirus has infected more than 170 million people and killed nearly 3. 6 million, according to a johns hopkins university tally. on the final day of the week-long assembly, the who member states agreed in a 14-page resolution to ""strengthen who's capacity to rapidly and appropriately assess disease outbreaks"" of possible global concern. ""it's essential that we strengthen global (disease) surveillance and provide the world health organization with the authority and the capacity to do this important job for all the peoples of the world,"" australian prime minister scott morrison told the assembly. the states called for a total overhaul of the global alarm system, and for a stronger, more independent who to help prevent future pandemics [file: francis mascarenhas/reuters]according to the findings of three independent panels that had reported to the assembly, countries and institutions had been woefully unprepared to deal with covid-19.  they called for a total overhaul of the global alarm system, and for a stronger, more independent who to help avert future pandemics. one of the reports found that the un agency had been too slow in declaring a so-called public health emergency of international concern.  who sounded its highest level of alert on january 30, 2020. after days of discussion, members agreed to create a new working group to study and streamline the numerous recommendations in the reports, and create concrete proposals for next year's assembly to consider. the text called for member states to ""ensure the adequate, flexible, sustainable and predictable financing of who's programme budget"". only about 16 percent of the who budget comes from regular membership fees, with the remainder coming from voluntary and heavily earmarked contributions. monday's resolution also called on all countries to strengthen their core public health capacities, increase their ability to detect new threats and communicate such threats effectively both at home and internationally. who's emergencies director, mike ryan, welcomed the decisions, saying: ""right now the pathogens have the upper hand, they are emerging more frequently and often silently in a planet that is out of balance. ""we need to turn that very thing that has exposed us in this pandemic, our interconnectedness, we need to turn that into a strength,"" he said. chile's ambassador frank tressler zamorano said on behalf of 60 countries that a pandemic treaty would help ""heed the call by so many experts to reset the system"". the resolution, meanwhile, stopped short of explicitly backing the experts' recommendation to hand the who broader powers to launch investigations or communicate about health threats without waiting for a green light from the countries concerned. those who have lost a partner

2021-06-01,Iran nuclear program: UN watchdog unable to access data since February.,"international atomic energy agency says it can provide only an estimate of iran's stockpilelast modified on tue 1 jun 2021 01. 08 bstthe united nations' atomic watchdog hasn't been able to access data important to monitoring iran's nuclear program since late february when the islamic republic started restricting international inspections of its facilities, the agency has said. the international atomic energy agency (iaea) reported on monday in a confidential document distributed to member countries and seen by the associated press that it has ""not had access to the data from its online enrichment monitors and electronic seals, or had access to the measurement recordings registered by its installed measurement devices"" since 23 february. while the iaea and iran earlier acknowledged the restrictions limited access to surveillance cameras at iranian facilities, monday's report indicated they went much further.  the iaea acknowledged it could provide only an estimate of iran's overall nuclear material stockpile as it continues to enrich uranium at its highest ever level. last week, the un's nuclear inspectorate said iran's failure to provide credible explanations for traces of uranium found at two undeclared sites was ""a big problem"" that was affecting the country's credibility. rafael grossi, the director general of the iaea, said: ""we know that something happened here.  there is no way round it.  we have found this.  there was material here.  when was this? what has happened with this equipment? where is the material.  they have to answer. ""he said it was not his job to give an ultimatum to iran to explain the cause of the unexplained uranium found at three sites, one of which iran said was a carpet cleaning facility, but to report the technical truth.  ""they know they have to provide explanations.  we are asking them to come clean with all these things because it can only help them.

""we need to turn that very thing that has exposed us in this pandemic, our interconnectedness, we need to turn that into a strength,"" he said. the decisions, approved in committee, are due to be formally adopted in a plenary session later on monday, the last day of its week-long assembly. one panel, headed by former new zealand prime minister helen clark and former liberian president ellen johnson sirleaf, said that a new global system should be set up to respond faster to disease outbreaks to help ensure no future virus causes a pandemic as devastating as covid-19. the experts, who found crucial failures in the global response in early 2020, said that the who should be given the power to send investigators swiftly to chase down new disease outbreaks and to publish their full findings without delay. they also called for setting up a global health threats council, to be led at the head of state and government level, to maintain political commitment to pandemic preparedness. ""the world was hit by this virus unprepared.  and if another virus emerged tomorrow this would be still be the case,"" mr bjorn kummel, of germany's federal health ministry, said last week.

2021-06-01,Football: Zidane says Real's lack of faith led to his departure.,"madrid: zinedine zidane said on monday he had stepped down as real madrid coach as the club's hierarchy did not have enough faith in him to rebuild an ageing squad. zidane, who returned to real for a second spell in charge in march 2019, won two la liga titles and three champions league crowns during his two stints as coach. however, he stepped down last week after real suffered their first trophyless season in 11 years, finishing second in la liga, being knocked out of the champions league semi-finals and suffering a humiliating copa del rey exit in the round of 32 to third division minnows alcoyano. in an open letter published in sports daily as, zidane said the first time he left as coach in 2018 was because he felt the team needed a new approach to stay at the highest level after enjoying so much success. ""right now, things are different,"" he said.  ""i'm leaving because i feel the club no longer has the faith in me i need, nor the support to build something in the medium or long term. ""zidane also suggested that his relationship with the club president had changed in recent weeks, and hit out at the series of leaks and stories about his future coming from within real. ""i would have liked my relationship with the club and the president over the past few months to have been a little different to that of other coaches,"" he added. ""i wasn't asking for privileges, of course not, just a little more recollection. ""it hurt me so much when i read in the press, after a defeat, that i would be sacked if i didn't win the next game. ""it hurt me and the whole team because these deliberately leaked messages to the media negatively influenced the squad, they created doubts and misunderstandings.

""as the pandemic continues to evolve globally, we must remain prepared and vigilant as a nation, while staying flexible and adaptable,"" mr gan said. he noted that the overall impact of phase two (heightened alert) measures on singapore's gross domestic product is expected to be modest, with the effects to differ across various sectors. domestic consumer-oriented sectors, such as food and beverage services, retail and land transport will be hit harder, while the impact on more outward-oriented sectors such as manufacturing and finance is likely to be less severe. last saturday, mr gan had visited supermarket chain fairprice's distribution centre in joo koon and a cold warehouse at local logistics firm ych's supply chain city to better understand the measures that have been put in place to ensure sufficient food and essential supplies for all. he said then that singapore and malaysia have been working together closely since the start of the pandemic to ensure the flow of goods and supplies are not disrupted. these efforts would continue following malaysia's full movement control order (mco) roll-out from june 1, he added. singapore imports an array of products from malaysia, which include food items such as chicken and vegetables. malaysia's total nationwide lockdown means that only essential economic sectors will be allowed to operate.  the country has seen new highs in covid-19 infections and deaths in may, despite putting in place moderate restrictions under the mco. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-06-01,WHO Approves China's Sinovac Covid Vaccine For Emergency Use.,"last month sinopharm became the first chinese vaccine to be approved by the who.  (file)the world health organization on tuesday approved the sinovac covid-19 vaccine for emergency use -- the second chinese jab to receive the who's green light. the un health agency signed off on the two-dose vaccine, which is already being deployed in several countries around the world. ""who today validated the sinovac-coronavac covid-19 vaccine for emergency use,"" it said in a statement. the move gives countries, funders, procuring agencies and communities ""assurance that it meets international standards for safety, efficacy and manufacturing"". last month sinopharm became the first chinese vaccine to be approved by the who. the organisation has also given emergency use listing to vaccines being made by pfizer/biontech, moderna, johnson & johnson, and the astrazeneca jab being produced in india, south korea and the eu, which it counts separately. who's listing paves the way for countries worldwide to quickly approve and import a vaccine for distribution, especially those states without an international-standard regulator of their own. it also opens the door for the jabs to enter the covax global vaccine-sharing scheme, which aims to provide equitable access to doses around the world, particularly in poorer countries. currently only astrazeneca and some pfizer jabs are flowing through the scheme. ""the world desperately needs multiple covid-19 vaccines to address the huge access inequity across the globe,"" said mariangela simao, the who's assistant director general for access to health products. ""we urge manufacturers to participate in the covax facility, share their know-how and data and contribute to bringing the pandemic under control.

2021-06-01,Two Malaysians in Singapore harassed by illegal moneylenders.,"
                    tuesday, 01 jun 2021
                johor baru: two malaysians working in singapore are being harassed by illegal moneylenders after trying to borrow money to recover their losses in an investment scheme. one of them, only wanting to be known as jackie, 28, said they tried to take a loan to recover the s$36,000 (rm112,465) lost in an investment scheme but ended up paying a total of s$5,100 (rm15,937) to the moneylender. ""we have been working in singapore for the past five years and have saved up a significant amount of money, enough to buy a house back home. ""we initially invested in a unit trust scheme through a friend in april in hopes of saving up even more money in the next one or two years so that we can return to malaysia and start a business but did not expect it to end in losses. ""to recover our losses, we found a facebook page advertising moneylending services in singapore and contacted them on may 16, thinking that it was a legitimate moneylender. ""i did not know at the time that moneylenders in singapore, even legal ones, are not allowed to advertise their services in public or social media, "" he said in a virtual press conference on tuesday (june 1). after submitting their identification documents to the moneylender, they were informed that the application was rejected, as they were not locals, and would have to pay s$2,500 (rm7,815) as an activation fee in order to get the loan, said jackie, who works in the food and beverage industry. desperate, they did as told but the moneylender asked for another s$3,000 (rm9,377) to ""process the application"".  by then, the two of them felt suspicious and wanted to cancel the loan. ""the moneylender said we would need to pay a cancellation fee of s$3,000 and gave us an alternative where he would transfer s$300 (rm937) to us and we have to repay him s$200 (rm624) daily for three days. ""we took the second option but on the fourth day, he threatened to splash paint at my friend's house in taman johor jaya, johor baru if we did not continue paying, so we transferred another s$200 to him. ""after seeking advice from a policeman, we ignored the moneylender.  however, on may 27, my friend's house was splashed with red paint, which also damaged her front gate, porch and car. ""the moneylender threatened to do more harm and asked for s$1,800 (rm5,625), which he said was inclusive of a fee to pay the runners who splashed paint at my friend's house. ""we also did as told out of fear for our family members' safety, "" he said, adding that police reports have been lodged in singapore and malaysia. when contacted, seri alam ocpd supt mohd sohaimi ishak said a police report regarding the paint splashing incident was received on may 27 and investigations are ongoing under section 427 of the penal code. meanwhile, mca national public complaints and services bureau deputy chief chua jian boon, who organised the press conference, reminded the public not to get loans from illegal moneylenders or through social media that promised fast-track loan approvals. ""with the total lockdown in place until june 14, i believe more people will face financial difficulties, which could lead to them asking for a loan from illegal sources or ah long. ""it is best not to do so as such moneylenders usually have hidden charges or conditions to trap their victims, "" he said.

2021-06-01,Singapore Rainbow Six squad left with days to find new org.,"stuck in a hotel room at the jw marriott hotel singapore south beach on his 13th day of his 21-day quarantine, glen ""lunarmetal"" suryasaputra still gave off a very positive vibe despite the recent situation over his ex-organisation. the 27-year-old full-time esports pro and captain of the former ex-giants gaming squad had just returned from france after competing at the us$3 million prize pool six invitational 2021, and was serving out his quarantine period with his teammates in the same hotel. it was then they found out that he and his team would be dropped from the giants gaming roster.  the news, which was then revealed publicly the next day on friday in a twitter post, meant that his team had to scramble to find an organisation to stay in the rainbow 6 apac south league. that's because the rules state that a team participating in the tournament has to have a legal entity behind it, and without an organisation, lunarmetal and his squad could be in danger of being removed.  thankfully, ubisoft, along with their former org, have offered to help, but the bulk of their search still has to be done by the team themselves. ""i think the timing [of them being dropped] was unexpected, but the decision was quite reasonable,"" said lunarmetal. it's a strange opinion, given that lunarmetal's team was impacted by the decision.  that said, to understand why, you need to know how the rainbow 6 apac league works. the rainbow 6 apac league is divided into two sections: apac north and apac south.  lunarmetal's squad were the champions of the apac north, before they were transferred over to apac south.  the move, lunarmetal said, was unexpected, to both players and their former org, which had picked them up because they had plans for the apac north market.  apac south, which now mainly focuses on southeast asian and oceanic teams, was not part of the giant's business strategy. ""we were the champions of north last season, we beat a lot of the big organisations, such as c9 and fnatic.  north was seen as the premier league, with powerhouse teams from japan and korea.  that's where the sponsors and viewers were.  in esports, viewership is king,"" explained lunarmetal. ""when giants picked us up in early 2020, they already had in mind that we were going to be in apac north.  the plans that they made when they picked us up was with us being in apac north. ""when ubisoft moved giants over to apac south to create a more competitive environment, viewership numbers grew, and it seemed that the strategy was paying off.  however, lunarmetal and his team weren't happy with how things were turning out, especially with the postponement of the six invitational (the equivalent of lol's worlds and dota 2's ti) that had been scheduled for february.  the team eventually finished in the last spots, which was not what they were hoping for. ""we should have definitely not been so affected by si being postponed, but if you're in a position like us, where some of us have to do national service, and trying to squeeze out the time we have left to practice and do our best, having the event postponed or cancelled, and then having to be moved to apac south, which was a surprise to all of us — it really affected our motivation,"" said lunarmetal. despite the setback, lunarmetal, his team, as well as their coach, have not given up on each other.  lunarmetal told yahoo esports that they plan to continue on together. ""we are reaching out to a lot of orgs, and we are liaising with ubisoft to find a new home.  because giants pulled out of their own accord, the licensing [to compete] still remains with us,"" said lunarmetal. ""i don't think we are at a risk of losing our slot at apac south.  it's just a matter for us to find an org to represent.  ubisoft has also explained to us about some contingency plans we can do if we can't find an org.

equivalent of lol's worlds and dota 2's ti) that had been scheduled for february."", 'the team eventually finished in the last spots, which was not what they were hoping for.', '""we should have definitely not been so affected by si being postponed, but if you\'re in a position like us, where some of us have to do national service, and trying to squeeze out the time we have left to practice and do our best, having the event postponed or cancelled, and then having to be moved to apac south, which was a surprise to all of us — it really affected our motivation,"" said lunarmetal.', 'despite the setback, lunarmetal, his team, as well as their coach, have not given up on each other.', 'lunarmetal told yahoo esports that they plan to continue on together.', '""we are reaching out

""sia sought and obtained strong shareholder support for the additional mcbs at the april 2020 extraordinary general meeting, with 99. 66 per cent of shareholders approving the resolution,"" the airline said in a response issued via the singapore exchange on tuesday (june 1) morning. ""this was subsequently renewed at the july 2020 annual general meeting (agm), where 99. 76 per cent of shareholders approved the resolution to issue the additional mcbs before the next agm in july 2021. ""the company raised $5. 3 billion via rights shares and $3. 5 billion via mcbs last year. it wants to raise another $6. 2 billion via mcbs this year before its agm in july. while the rights issue was well subscribed, the mcb met with tepid response, resulting in substantial shareholder temasek subscribing to the bulk of it, a point that was raised by sias last week. as the shareholders had voted for the fund raising, it was their prerogative to decide if they would subscribe to the mcbs, subject to their own financial circumstances, said sia. in all, sia has raised $15. 4 billion in fresh liquidity since april 1 last year. this includes the $8. 8 billion in rights shares and mcb last year and another $6. 6 billion through bond issues, secured financing and sale and leaseback transactions. besides the $6. 2 billion in fresh liquidity that it hopes to raise through the latest mcbs, it also has $2. 1 billion in untapped lines of credit on top of all the other funds raised. because the mcbs are considered equity, sia has more headroom for further debt financing going forward, if needed. sia said the proceeds would strengthen its financial foundations to meet ongoing financial commitments, allow it to make the necessary investments and capitalise on any opportunities that may arise so as to secure its industry-leading position, as well as provide resources for growth as it navigates through the ongoing crisis. ""the successful implementation of the group's strategy is also dependent on its ability to retain its talented and motivated employees, and to continue having a strong employer brand to attract new talent,"" said sia. it added that it had a pipeline of new-generation aircraft airbus a350s and boeing 787s on order that it could use for further secured financing and sale and leaseback transactions. the airline expects the proceeds to last well through its 2022/2023 financial year. it added: ""since the beginning of the covid-19 pandemic crisis, our monthly operating cash burn has dropped to the current levels of around $100 million to $150 million per month, from around $350 million at the start of the pandemic. ""we will continue to pursue reduction in cash burn through revenue generation (for example, strong cargo revenue and gradual improvement in passenger flown revenue through more flying activities).  in addition, we will continue to maintain stringent cost management. ""turning to sias' question of whether sia would consider privatisation, the company said: ""privatisation is not a matter for sia to consider as it is a shareholder action.  accordingly, sia is not in a position to comment. ""but analysts told the straits times that if privatisation were ever to be contemplated which is unlikely such an exercise could be done only with the approval of majority shareholder temasek. sia said it was grateful to all shareholders, including retail investors, for their strong support over the years and especially since the start of the covid-19 pandemic. ""our goal is to provide long-term value for shareholders by ensuring that the company returns to profitability and remains a leader in the airline industry as we navigate the challenges posed by the covid-19 pandemic,"" it said. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-06-01,Three-child policy: China lifts cap on births in major policy shift.,"beijing: married chinese couples may have up to three children, china announced on monday (may 31), in a major shift from the existing limit of two after recent data showed a dramatic decline in births in the world's most populous country. beijing scrapped its decades-old one-child policy in 2016, replacing it with a two-child limit to try and stave off risks to its economy from a rapidly aging population.  but that failed to result in a sustained surge in births given the high cost of raising children in chinese cities, a challenge that persists to this day. the policy change will come with ""supportive measures, which will be conducive to improving our country's population structure, fulfilling the country's strategy of actively coping with an ageing population"", the official xinhua news agency said following a politburo meeting chaired by president xi jinping. among those measures, china will lower educational costs for families, step up tax and housing support, guarantee the legal interests of working women and clamp down on ""sky-high"" dowries, it said, without giving specifics.  it would also look to educate young people ""on marriage and love"". china had a fertility rate of just 1. 3 children per woman in 2020, recent data showed, on par with ageing societies like japan and italy and far short of the roughly 2. 1 needed for replacement level. ""people are held back not by the two-children limit, but by the incredibly high costs of raising children in today's china.  housing, extracurricular activities, food, trips, and everything else add up quickly,"" yifei li, a sociologist at nyu shanghai, told reuters. ""raising the limit itself is unlikely to tilt anyone's calculus in a meaningful way, in my view. ""zhang xinyu, a 30-year-old mother of one from zhengzhou, the capital of henan province, said the problem was that women bore most of the responsibility for raising children. ""if men could do more to raise the child, or if families could give more consideration for women who had just had children, actually a lot of women would be able to have a second child,"" she told reuters. "". . .  but thinking of the big picture, realistically, i don't want to have a second child.  and a third is even more impossible. ""in a poll on xinhua's weibo account asking #areyouready for the three-child policy, about 29,000 of 31,000 respondents said they would ""never think of it"" while the remainder chose among the options: ""i'm ready and very eager to do so"", ""it's on my agenda"", or ""i'm hesitating and there's lot to consider"". the poll was later removed. ""i am willing to have three children if you give me 5 million yuan (us$785,650),"" one user posted. share prices in birth- and fertility-related companies surged. ""too late now""early this month, a once-in-a-decade census showed that the population grew at its slowest rate during the last decade since the 1950s, to 1. 41 billion, fuelling concerns that china would grow old before it gets wealthy as well as criticism that it had waited too long to address declining births. ""this is without a doubt a step in the right direction, but still it's a bit timid,"" shuang ding, chief economist at standard chartered in hong kong, told reuters. ""a fully liberalised birth policy should have been implemented at least five years ago, but it's too late now, although its better late than never,"" he said. china's politburo also said on monday that it would phase in delays in retirement ages, but did not provide any details. fines of 130,000 yuan (us$20,440) were being imposed on people for having a third child as of late last year, according to a government notice in the city of weihai. fearing a population explosion, in 1979 china implemented its one-child policy, which succeeded in curbing population growth but also led to coerced sterilisations and sex-selective abortions that exacerbated a gender imbalance as many parents preferred male children. a study published earlier this year by academics from hangzhou university found that the two-child policy encouraged wealthier couples who already had a child and were ""less sensitive to child-rearing costs"", while driving up the costs of child care and education and discouraging first-time parents. su meizhen, a human resources manager in beijing, said she was ""super-happy"" to be pregnant with her third child. ""we won't have to pay the fine and we'll be able to get a hukou,"" she said, referring to the urban residence permit that enables families to receive benefits including sending their children to local public schools. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

""the planes flew in that formation using the same point of entry and exit.  the planes then changed (direction), heading to the beting patinggi ali air space which is important to the country. ""the plaaf planes then flew via singapore fir before entering the malaysia maritime zone air space and the kota kinabalu fir, the rmaf statement said, adding that the chinese planes approached within 60 nautical miles of  sarawak beach, ""threatening malaysia's sovereignty"". the rmaf then put its hawk 208 jets from no.  6 squadron on high alert, said the statement. ""the plaaf planes were put under continued radar surveillance and were instructed to contact controllers in the kota kinabalu fir.  when these instructions were not heeded and the plaaf planes crossed kota kinabalu fir and headed towards the national airspace, the malaysia air force scrambled intercepting jets at 1. 33pm to perform a visual identification. """"as a result of the air interception carried out, the rmaf has identified the aircraft as ilyushin il-76 and xian y-20 aircraft.  these types of aircraft are strategic transport aircraft and capable of performing various missions.  this incident is a serious matter that threatens national sovereignty and aviation safety, based on the density of air traffic in the airline routes in kota kinabalu fir"". ""this incident was handled by the malaysian air force based on protocols by the icao and our national air defence strategy.  the foreign ministry has taken note of this through the defence ministry,"" the statement added. ""routine flight training""the chinese embassy in malaysia said on tuesday the planes were conducting routine flight training. ""as far as i know, the reported activities are routine flight training of the chinese air force and do not target any country,"" said a spokesperson. ""chinese military aircraft enjoy the freedom of overflight in the relevant airspace. ""during this training, the chinese military aircraft strictly abided by the relevant international law and did not enter the territorial airspace of any other country.

2021-06-01,IAEA highlights ‘complicated’ Iran ties as nuclear talks continue.,"tehran, iran – as nuclear talks to restore iran's 2015 nuclear deal appear likely to be extended, a report by the global nuclear watchdog has highlighted its complicated monitoring relationship with iran. in a report circulated on monday, the international atomic energy agency (iaea) said iran has failed to thoroughly explain traces of uranium found at several previously undeclared sites. ""after many months, iran has not provided the necessary explanation for the presence of the nuclear material particles at any of the three locations where the agency has conducted complementary accesses [inspections],"" the iaea told member states. the united kingdom, france and germany, the three european powers party to iran's nuclear deal, tried to censure iran at the iaea board of governors – with backing from the united states – earlier this year but dropped their plan after iran agreed to cooperate with international experts. another board meeting is due later this month, but pursuing a similar plan by the european powers could directly endanger ongoing talks in vienna to restore the joint comprehensive plan of action (jcpoa), as the nuclear deal is formally known. iran's nuclear chief ali akbar salehi wrote a letter to iaea director general rafael grossi after the latest agency report was published. according to iran's vienna envoy kazem gharibabadi, he pointed out in the letter that iran recently agreed to keep recording its nuclear facilities for another month in order to continue technical negotiations with the agency. ""on safeguards, iran has so far done its utmost efforts to cooperate with the agency substantively and provide the necessary clarifications and responses,"" gharibabadi tweeted, adding iran will continue to cooperate. in response, russia's top negotiator in vienna, mikhail ulyanov, said the relationship between iran and the iaea is ""complicated"" at the moment but ""we have reasons to believe that the current difficulties are temporary of character"". this is while a fifth round of talks in vienna to lift us sanctions on iran and bring it back to full compliance with the jcpoa may not be the last as delegates hoped. iran's top negotiator, deputy foreign minister abbas araghchi, said on monday he believes the delegates may need to go back to their capitals one more time to consult. ""we have reached the main issues of dispute.  we're at a point where we're only dealing with the obvious differences and much of the required texts have been drafted,"" he said. former us president donald trump unilaterally abandoned the nuclear deal in may 2018, levelling relentless waves of sanctions as part of his administration's ""maximum pressure"" campaign on iran. efforts to restore the deal continue as iran heads for its june 18 election, in which conservative judiciary chief ebrahim raisi is the frontrunner. the iaea report on monday also provided the first detailed insight into the ramifications of sabotage at iran's main nuclear facilities in natanz – one of several over the past year – which the country blamed on israel. the agency said iran's total stockpile of enriched uranium of various grades increased by an estimated 273kg (600 pounds) in the three months ending may 22, just over half the 525kg increase in the previous quarter. the power blackout at natanz happened mid-way in that period, on april 11. iran started enriching uranium up to a purity of more than 60 percent following the incident, its highest yet, prompting iaea's grossi to call it ""very concerning"" last month.  iran's stockpile of 60-percent enriched uranium now stands at just 2. 4kg, according to the watchdog. but the iaea also said iran's total stockpile is now estimated to be about 3,241kg, about 16 times higher than the permitted stockpile under the jcpoa, which also capped enrichment at 3. 67 percent. a fifth round of dialogue to revive the 2015 iran nuclear deal is under way in vienna. the one-month extension gives negotiators in vienna time to revive the nuclear deal from which the us withdrew in 2018. as us and iran try to revive nuclear deal, experts warn about iaea safeguards governing the frequency of inspections. follow al jazeera

2021-06-01,'Very unlikely' to resume Phase 3 straight after 13 Jun.,"singapore — while there are signs that the community spread of covid-19 is coming under control, it is ""very unlikely"" that singapore will immediately revert to phase 3 of its re-opening when phase 2 (heightened alert) ends on 13 june, said finance minister lawrence wong on monday (31 may).  ""we will have to do this gradually. . . so there is some chance of relaxation, but in a controlled and calibrated manner,"" said wong, who co-chairs the multi-ministry taskforce on covid-19.  addressing reporters at a virtual press conference, wong noted that the situation remains highly fluid, in response to a question on whether there might be another spike in covid-19 cases.  ""if we monitor over time and we see new risks emerging, new clusters emerging, more unlinked cases which we are not able to track down and pin down, then it may suggest that this is continuing, a little bit more than we are comfortable with, and therefore we may have to take additional restrictions or precautions and safeguards, based on the data,"" he added.  earlier, health minister ong ye kung noted that the number of community cases in the past 14 days – one full infection cycle – has fallen.  by dividing the past 14 days into two halves, the first seven days (17-23 may) saw 182 cases, followed by 136 cases in the next seven days. in addition, the percentage of unlinked cases has also fallen from 22 per cent of all cases to 18 per cent.  one key method for controlling and monitoring infections is testing, ong said.  in the second half of may, on average, more than 55,000 polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and antigen rapid test (art) tests were conducted each day, according to ong.

2021-06-01,Expect warm and humid nights in first half of June: Met Service.,"singapore: the warm and humid weather in may is expected to continue into the first half of june, the meteorological service singapore (mss) said on tuesday (jun 1). in the first fortnight of june, the nights are also expected to be warm and humid, with night-time minimum temperatures of up to 28 degrees celsius expected on some days. warm nights typically occur when the prevailing winds blow from the southeast and brings warm, humid air from the sea over the land, mss said. the daily temperature is forecast to range between 25 degrees celsius and 34 degrees celsius on most days, with the mercury potentially hitting 35 degrees celsius on a few days when there are few clouds in the sky. the prevailing light and variable winds over singapore and the surrounding region are forecast to strengthen and blow from the southeast or southwest. this signals the end of the inter-monsoon period and the start of the southwest monsoon season, which typically extends into september and is a generally drier season compared to other times of the year. the monsoon rain band is forecast to lie over the northern southeast asia region, bringing generally dry, warm, and humid conditions over singapore and the surrounding region on some days. on several days, there will be localised short-duration showers, at times with thunder, over a few parts of the island in the late morning and early afternoon. ""on one or two days, sumatra squalls moving from the strait of malacca to the south china sea are expected to bring island-wide thundery showers with occasional gusty winds in the morning,"" said the met service. the overall rainfall for the first half of june 2021 is likely to be below normal over most parts of singapore. review of may weatherin its review for the weather last month, the met service said that inter-monsoon conditions prevailed over singapore and the surrounding region, and the prevailing winds were generally light and blew from the east, southeast or southwest. thundery showers fell over parts of the island on most days, mainly in the late morning and afternoon.  they were due to strong daytime heating of land areas, a convergence of winds over singapore and the surrounding vicinity, or a combination of both factors, the met service said. the heaviest thundery showers during the month occurred on may 17 and may 18, particularly over the western and central parts of the island. on both occasions, a convergence of winds over singapore and the surrounding vicinity brought thundery showers in the late morning, early afternoon and in the night. in may, the highest rainfall of 117. 2mm was recorded on may 17 at jurong west, while the highest daily total was 132. 0mm, recorded at toa payoh. ""climatologically, may is one of the warmest months of the year,"" said the met service. the highest daily maximum temperature recorded across the island was at least 34 degrees celsius on 18 days, with the peak 35. 7 degrees celsius recorded at marina barrage on may 11. there were also a few warm nights where the night-time temperature was around 28 degrees celsius, particularly over the south-eastern part of the island. rainfall was slightly above average for most parts of singapore in may.  the highest rainfall anomaly of 69 per cent above average was recorded at jurong.  the anomaly was lowest at kranji at 56 per cent below average. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

""i'm leaving because i feel the club no longer has the faith in me i need, and doesn't offer me the support to build something in the medium or long term,"" the frenchman wrote in the letter published in the sports daily as. ""i am a born winner and i was here to win trophies, but beyond this there are human beings, emotions, life and i have the feeling that these things have not been valued, that it has not been understood that this is also how the dynamic of a great club is maintained,"" he said. ""but everything i built on a daily basis, what i brought to the relationship with the players. . .  has been forgotten. "" ""i'm leaving, but i'm not jumping ship and i'm not tired of coaching,"" he said. real had a disappointing season, finishing second in la liga behind neigbours atletico madrid and losing to eventual winners chelsea in the champions league semi-finals. it is the second time that zidane has resigned as real madrid manager. the 1998 world cup winner first took the helm in january 2016 and guided real to the 2017 la liga title and an unprecedented hat-trick of champions league titles before abruptly quitting on may 31, 2018. less than a year later he returned after julen lopetegui and santiago solari were sacked as managers in quick succession. in his letter zidane said he left the club in 2018 because it needed ""a different voice to keep itself at the highest"" but this time ""things are different"". ""i want what we have achieved together to be respected.  i would have liked in recent months my relationship with the club and with the president (florentino perez) to have been a little different from that of other coaches,"" zidane said. ""i wasn't asking for privileges, of course not, but a little more memory,"" added zidane. 'always grateful' zidane's contract with real was set to expire in 2022 but he had repeatedly refused to confirm he would still be at the club next season. he has a history of making surprise announcements: as a player, he initially announced his retirement from international football in 2004 before coming back for the 2006 world cup, after which he retired for good following his red card for butting on italy's marco materazzi as france lost the final. ""spending 20 years in madrid has been the most beautiful thing that has ever happened to me in life and i know that i owe it exclusively to florentino perez who bet on me in 2001,"" zidane said in the letter. ""i say it from the heart, i will always be grateful to the 'presi' for it.  always,"" he added. zidane now take another break from football although there has been talk of him either taking charge of the french national team or juventus, where he spent five years as a player. juventus are suffering financially as a result of the covid-19 pandemic and might not be in a position to entice him. didier deschamps, who led france to victory in the last world cup,  is likely to remain national coach until the 2022 world cup in qatar, barring a disastrous performance at the european championship that kicks off next month.  — afploading. . . © 2021, malay mail, all rights reserved.

2021-06-01,China's tutoring groups fined millions as scrutiny grows.,"beijing: fifteen tutoring firms have been hammered with millions of dollars of fines over alleged fraud, chinese state media said on tuesday (jun 1), as the government's chastening of the tech sector seeps into the private education businesses. the groups including major brands like zuoyebang, which counts alibaba as an investor, and tencent-backed yuanfudao were hit with fines amounting to 36. 5 million yuan (us$5. 7 million). after issuing fines and warnings to tech companies spanning e-commerce, gaming, video streaming and food deliveries, beijing has in recent days turned its attention towards tutoring start-ups, many of them online. the penalties follow a warning by president xi jinping in march of problems in the education sector, including excessive pressure on young students. a number of potential initial public offerings for companies running learning apps have since ground to a halt, reported bloomberg news on monday, naming both zuoyebang and yuanfudao among those that were holding off preparations. the education ministry also plans to create a division overseeing private education platforms, the report added. on tuesday, china's market watchdog said an investigation into the 15 institutions which include online apps alleged they had engaged in ""false advertising"", with many also found to have conducted ""price fraud"". for example, bond education is accused of inflating a package of trial classes to 420 yuan and offering it at an apparent discount of 12 yuan, state broadcaster cctv reported. among other wrongdoings were ""fabricating teacher qualifications, exaggerating the effects of training . . .  and fabricating user reviews"", according to the state administration for market regulation. the services aimed to induce parents to fork over money, said regulators. this follows similar practices by zuoyebang and yuanfudao that authorities flagged in may, including a false claim by zuoyebang of a collaboration with the united nations. intense competition starting from a young age has amplified the pressure on china's parents to pay extra to get their children ahead in the congested education system. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

(afp/anne-christine poujoulat. )on court philippe chatrier, federer kicked off only his second french open campaign in six years with an impressive dismissal of denis istomin. the 39-year-old federer, level with rafael nadal on 20 grand slam singles titles, saw off uzbek istomin 6-2, 6-4, 6-3. federer arrived at roland garros having played only three matches since his australian open semi-final loss to novak djokovic last year, before the covid-19 pandemic hit. the swiss great lost to pablo andujar in his first clay-court outing of the season earlier this month in geneva, but struck 48 winners as he raced to victory over istomin. he had been keen to play down any thoughts that he can add to his 2009 roland garros title in the run-up to the tournament, but was more positive after his win. ""for me coming back after many months or over a year of rehab, the light at the end of the tunnel or the measuring stick was always can i come back to a good level against good players,"" said federer.

(afp/anne-christine poujoulat)later on monday, serena williams survived a brief scare against romania's irina-camelia begu to win 7-6 (8/6), 6-2 in the first ever official french open night match. the 39-year-old, still one behind margaret court's all-time record of 24 grand slam singles titles, saved two set points in the first-set tie-break but dominated from then on. ""it wasn't easy in that first set.  i was up and i felt like i had some opportunities,"" said williams, who will next face begu's compatriot mihaela buzarnescu. the match under the lights on court philippe chatrier was played behind closed doors due to a 9pm curfew imposed by the french government due to covid-19. defending champion swiatek, celebrating her 20th birthday, saw off her good friend kaja juvan 6-0, 7-5 on court philippe chatrier. swiatek, who became the first grand slam singles title winner from poland last october, hit 22 winners in an impressive opening to her bid for a second straight roland garros triumph. ""i tried to put it behind me (being defending champion) and kind of use it in a positive way because i just know that i'm feeling good here,"" said the eighth seed. daniil medvedev, who had lost in the first round in all of his four previous appearances in the tournament, put his poor clay-court form behind him by beating the dangerous alexander bublik 6-3, 6-3, 7-5. the two-time grand slam runner-up was too strong for kazakh bublik, setting up a second-round tie against us player tommy paul. ""it was a good match and i've been training really well,"" said second seed medvedev. the russian is bidding to take advantage of being in the opposite half of the draw to 13-time champion nadal, djokovic and federer, while fourth seed dominic thiem was knocked out on sunday. elsewhere, sixth seed bianca andreescu was dumped out after losing a marathon first-round match with slovenia's world number 85 tamara zidansek 6-7 (1/7), 7-6 (7/2), 9-7. fourth seed sofia kenin, last year's losing finalist, did battle through, though, edging out 2017 champion jelena ostapenko 6-4, 4-6, 6-3. © 2016

2021-06-01,Rise of armed civilian groups in Myanmar fuels fears of full-scale civil war.,"dozens of grassroots people's defence forces have emerged to take on brutal militarylast modified on tue 1 jun 2021 05. 16 bstmyanmar is on the verge of a new civil war, a spokesperson for the country's parallel government has warned, as communities increasingly take up arms to protect themselves from a relentless campaign of military violence. conflict has raged for decades in myanmar's borderlands, where myriad ethnic armed groups are fighting with the military for greater autonomy.  since february's coup, however, dozens of new, grassroots people's defence forces have emerged to oppose the junta, with battles occurring in areas of the country that were previously peaceful. ""the people of myanmar have been left with no other choice.  they just have no other option left,"" said dr sasa, spokesperson for myanmar's national unity government (nug), which was set up by pro-democracy politicians. the constant threat of military raids, arrests, torture and killings had pushed communities to take up arms, he said. ""it is just the beginning.  the situation will become out of control.  even if it is one man in a village, they will not just bow in front of these murderers.  it is the whole country on the road to civil war,"" sasa said. over the past week, tens of thousands of people have been displaced in eastern kayah state by intense fighting between the military, the newly formed karenni people's defence force and the karenni army, an established ethnic armed group.  on monday evening, the military used helicopters to bomb and fire at civilian fighters, the karenni people's defence force told local media.  ""we attacked with light weapons but they responded with artillery shells,"" a the kpdf member told the independent outlet myanmar now. at least 58 defence forces have formed across the country, of which 12 are active, according to the armed conflict location and event data project (acled), a non-profit that tracks conflict.  these groups are formed at a local level and are not necessarily officially linked to the nug.  groups have revealed little about the nature of their training, but their resources and intensity vary. in the town of mindat in chin state, one of the poorest areas of the country, volunteers armed with little more than traditional hunting guns rose up against the military in may.  elsewhere, young city dwellers have fled to the jungle to learn how to make homemade explosives.  celebrities are among those who have announced that they are joining training – from a former beauty queen who represented myanmar in the miss grand international contest, htar htet htet, to han htoo lwin, known as kyar pauk, the lead singer of punk rock band big bag. in myanmar's biggest city, yangon, members of the security forces have been targeted in a wave of attacks over the past week, including shootings and explosions.  a wedding party was also targeted, reportedly because the groom was suspected of being a military informant.  four people were killed – including the bride – after a bomb was disguised as a gift, according to local media.  no one has claimed responsibility for the blasts. schools across the country, some of which have been occupied by the military, have been bombed or set alight by unknown perpetrators, in what may be an attempt to reinforce the shutdown of the education system by anti-coup protesters.  the junta has ordered parents to register their children to return to school, but the vast majority have not done so.  more than half of the teachers working in state schools are on strike, according to local media. such attacks, including the targeting of individuals suspected of colluding with the military, were a worrying trend, said richard horsey, senior myanmar adviser to crisis group.  ""it will be difficult to contain once this kind of violence becomes the norm.  it's hard to shut these dynamics down again later. ""the nug, which has spoken of plans to build a new federal army, has urged anti-coup groups to follow ethical guidelines and not target schools or hospitals.  it released a video on saturday showing the first batch of defence force troops who have finished training. some ethnic armed groups have offered support to anti-coup forces, though others are ambivalent.  groups could seek to exploit the coup for their own territorial gains, further complicating the crisis. anti-coup defence forces face an infamously brutal military that has an estimated 400,000 armed personnel, making it the second largest in south-east asia after vietnam's.  it is supplied primarily by china and russia, drawing on generous state funding as well as its lucrative business networks – which campaigners are trying to weaken by placing pressure on international companies. sasa is calling for the international community to recognise the nug as the official leaders of myanmar.  doing so, he said, would help the body to demand that oil and gas companies, such as total and chevron, hand over payments to democratic officials rather than army generals. ""it is an insult to us that the gas that is from the land of myanmar is being used by these military generals, and being paid for by total company or [other] western companies, to buy weapons from russia and china to kill the people of myanmar,"" he said. nine neighbouring south-east asian countries have reportedly proposed that a draft un resolution be weakened by removing a call for an arms embargo. sasa called for like-minded countries to push for the measure, and to introduce tougher, targeted sanctions.  the more the international community delayed, he added, ""the more bloody it will become, the closer we get to civil war and genocide"". more battles are already reported to have taken place in myanmar in the first half of 2021 than in the entirety of last year, according to acled.  it has also tracked sharp increases in reports of attacks on civilians, and reports of explosions and other forms of remote violence, which include the deployment of artillery, shelling, grenades or ieds. previously, conflict was concentrated in rakhine state and northern shan state, but it has now spread more widely across the country.  this is likely to place pressure on local commanders, said horsey, but it is hard to know what impact it will have on the military as a whole. ""they are quite large, they have a lot of military resources and they are not concerned at all about civilian casualties.  in fact, their whole approach to internal conflict over the decades has been to deliberately target civilians as part of a quite brutal counter-insurgency strategy,"" horsey said. salai za uk ling, deputy executive director of the chin human rights organization, said people from mindat reported the military had used civilians as human shields during recent clashes.  thousands of people from the town remain stranded just as the rainy season was beginning, he said. ""they say they are getting very, very desperate.  there has been some delivery of food aid and basic medical aid from volunteers, but there has been no large-scale delivery,"" he added, warning of an impending humanitarian crisis.  covid-19 is also spreading along the indian border. at least 833 people have been killed by the military since it seized power in february, according to estimates by the advocacy group assistance association for political prisoners burma.  thousands have been detained, often in unknown locations where they are at risk of torture. an activist who has met young people who are training to fight the military, and who asked to remain anonymous, said volunteers believed violence was the only language the military understood.  ""they want to scare the soldiers coming into their communities making arrests, beating and torturing,"" she said.  ""some people are hoteliers, some have their own restaurants, bars – and they have now left all their businesses. ""one young medical student had fled alone to train, the activist said.  ""she was so passionate because her friends got killed.  her place was terrorised under martial law.  she saw people burning alive in front of her.  that experience pushed her to pick up the gun.

2021-06-01,WHO approves China's Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine.,"geneva: the world health organization (who) on tuesday (jun 1) approved the sinovac covid-19 vaccine for emergency use the second chinese jab to receive the who's green light. the un health agency signed off on the two-dose vaccine, which is already being deployed in several countries around the world. ""who today validated the sinovac-coronavac covid-19 vaccine for emergency use,"" it said in a statement. the move gives countries, funders, procuring agencies and communities ""assurance that it meets international standards for safety, efficacy and manufacturing"". last month sinopharm became the first chinese vaccine to be approved by the who. the organisation has also given emergency use listing to vaccines being made by pfizer-biontech, moderna, johnson & johnson, and the astrazeneca jab being produced in india, south korea and the eu, which it counts separately. who's listing paves the way for countries worldwide to quickly approve and import a vaccine for distribution, especially those states without an international-standard regulator of their own. it also opens the door for the jabs to enter the covax global vaccine-sharing scheme, which aims to provide equitable access to doses around the world, particularly in poorer countries. currently only astrazeneca and some pfizer jabs are flowing through the scheme. ""the world desperately needs multiple covid-19 vaccines to address the huge access inequity across the globe,"" said mariangela simao, the who's assistant director general for access to health products. ""we urge manufacturers to participate in the covax facility, share their know-how and data and contribute to bringing the pandemic under control. ""the sinovac jab is already in use in 22 territories around the world, according to an afp count. apart from china, the countries using sinovac include chile, brazil, indonesia, mexico, thailand and turkey. the who's strategic advisory group of experts on immunisation have reviewed the jab and published their advice on its usage. ""who recommends the vaccine for use in adults 18 years and older, in a two-dose schedule with a spacing of two to four weeks,"" the agency said. ""vaccine efficacy results showed that the vaccine prevented symptomatic disease in 51 per cent of those vaccinated and prevented severe covid-19 and hospitalisation in 100 per cent of the studied population.

2021-06-01,School's out for Myanmar students defying junta threats.,"yangon: schools in myanmar will open on tuesday (jun 1) for the first time since the military seized power, but teachers and students are set to defy the junta's calls for full classrooms in a show of resistance. four months of national turmoil have followed the february ouster of civilian leader aung san suu kyi, with more than 800 people killed by security forces and a nationwide strike crippling the economy. public school teachers dressed in the green and white uniforms mandated by the education ministry were prominent in the early mass protests, joining railway workers, doctors and civil servants on the streets. the junta has insisted schools open on tuesday after a year's absence due to covid-19, but many educators had already decided they could not return to a job they love. ""i'm not afraid of their arrest and torture,"" shwe nadi, a teacher from the commercial capital yangon told afp.  her name has been changed for her safety. ""i'm afraid of becoming a teacher who teaches the students propaganda. ""the 28-year-old was fired for supporting the civil disobedience movement one of the thousands of teachers and academics the junta has sacked. ""of course, i feel bad losing my job because i loved being a teacher.  although it is not well paid, we have our pride for being teachers as others respect us,"" she said. nu may not her real name in southern mon state will also stay away, she told afp. the primary school teacher lost months of her salary after joining the nationwide boycott, but said ""my soul is pure"" because she participated in the strike. ""when i see how they have killed a lot of people, i feel i don't want to be their teacher any more,"" she added. some of those killed in the junta's crackdown were of primary school age, and charity group save the children said the dead include 15 children under the age of 16. ""we don't want traitors""junta-run media has in recent days carried pictures of functionaries watching school registrations and promising that parents will be ""satisfied"" with the return of classes. students at a school near the capital naypyidaw opened a setpiece ceremony to mark the new term by performing a ""national enrolment week"" song in front of the regime's education minister, according to the global new light of myanmar state newspaper. but at one high school in central sagaing region, a slogan daubed in red paint across the front of the building urges staff members to stay away. ""we do not want the military slavery teachers,"" showed pictures carried by local media.  ""we do not want the teachers who are traitors. ""university students were key drivers of political activism under nearly five decades of earlier military rulers, who violently suppressed any signs of public dissent. many students back then were killed, jailed or expelled, and universities were shuttered for several years. ""not one of my friends is going""some university classes are already back in session, but boycotts have seen widespread absences on both sides of the teaching lectern. ""not one of my friends is going,"" said an english major at a university in mawlamyine, a city that saw brutal crackdowns by security forces against protesters. ""so i decided not to go too. ""her class of 100 is now empty, despite students being summoned by the few remaining professors on campus. protesters have discouraged parents and teachers from sending children to schools that still have teachers willing to work, saying it amounted to backing the military regime. ""do not be sad when you cannot enrol your child at school when some parents have no children to enrol,"" read a banner in bago region, south of the capital. teacher shwe nadi said she will remain committed to the civil disobedience movement, despite fears of being detained or worse.

2021-06-01,"Students can register to get vaccinated from today, Latest Singapore News.","madam rini saadon has been reading with a heavy heart recent news reports of schoolchildren getting infected with the covid-19 virus. a mother of four, including a pair of twin boys in secondary 3, the homemaker was also concerned for the well-being of her children. it is why yesterday's announcement that students in singapore will soon be able to get vaccinated comes as a relief. her twins will be among more than 400,000 students who will be invited to book their covid-19 jabs from today, education minister chan chun sing announced yesterday.  the earliest vaccination slots will be from thursday. his announcement came after prime minister lee hsien loong gave an update on the covid-19 situation here in a live broadcast on national television, while also providing an overview of singapore's vaccination, testing and contact tracing strategy going forward. the vaccination exercise will kick off with the 56,000 students who will be sitting for the n, o, and a levels, as well as other equivalent qualifications, such as the international baccalaureate diploma, in the second half of this year, the ministry of education (moe) said. over the next two weeks, the invitations will be progressively extended to other full-time students, including those in institutes of higher learning, madrasahs and special education (sped) schools. speaking at a virtual multi-ministry task force press conference after the pm's speech, mr chan said: ""all medically eligible individuals are encouraged to consider getting vaccinated when the vaccination is offered to them. ""and we would like to thank all parents for working closely with our educators and schools to keep our children safe. ""students who are 18 and above will receive an sms containing a unique link for them to book a slot for the first dose of the vaccine at any of the vaccination centres around singapore.  the second dose will be given around six to eight weeks later. for children under 18, who will need parental consent to take the jabs, the sms invitations will be sent to their parents or guardians. those below 13 will have to be accompanied by their parents or guardians during their jab. those aged 18 and above will have a choice of either the pfizer-biontech or moderna vaccines.  those between 12 and 17 will be offered only the pfizer-biontech jab. four dedicated moe vaccination centres will be set up from next monday to support the vaccination roll-out for students. they include three centres at the institute of technical education (ite) college campuses in ang mo kio, choa chu kang and simei, and one at the raffles city convention centre. the ite centres will be able to administer 1,600 vaccine doses a day, while the raffles city centre can do 2,000 doses a day. the ite will arrange for their students to take their shots on campus, and the ministry of health (moh) will send mobile vaccination teams to sped schools as the students may find it challenging to visit a vaccination site. schools will also look into alternative vaccination arrangements for those who need extra support when schools reopen after the current june holidays, including providing transport to the vaccination centres, moe said. the vaccination exercise for students is estimated to be completed by august. madam rini's eldest son, adam naufal, 15, said he understands the importance of the vaccination. the loyang view secondary school student said: ""while i am a little worried about the fever and body aches after the jab, i will still get vaccinated. ""madam rini said that some of her friends whose children have a history of illness or allergies have concerns over safety and will be more cautious and do more research before sending their children for the vaccine. ""it is understandable to be more careful when it comes to our children's health,"" she added. at yesterday's press conference, moh's director of medical services kenneth mak said that based on the ongoing phase three studies that involve nearly 2,300 adolescents between the ages of 12 and 16, there was a very high vaccine efficacy in the vaccinated group. he added: ""we will be watching very closely the experience of others, in the us, in israel, and it will guide our policy even as we start our own programme to offer vaccinations to our schoolchildren. ""to address parents' questions and concerns about the vaccines, moe will be partnering with moh to organise webinars for them. mr woon wui tek, a father of two sons aged 13 and 10, hopes his older son can get vaccinated before he returns to school in july. the 48-year-old who works in a bank said: ""based on the medical evidence up to now, i don't see any reason why he should not be vaccinated. ""singapore management university student lareina chan, 19, said it is important for undergrads to get vaccinated as most like to hang out in groups for projects and outings. ""dr ling li min, an infectious disease physician from rophi clinic, said this latest move is a positive step in the nation's fight against the virus. she said: ""the vaccine will protect the kids from covid and against rare severe complications such as the post-covid multi-inflammatory syndrome, as well as reduce risk of transmission to their more vulnerable household members. ""the pfizer study has shown that the vaccine is safe and works very well.  the vaccine does not stay in the body it will not impact the child's growth.  getting all eligible students vaccinated will go far in achieving effective population herd immunity.

2021-06-01,Netanyahu legal challenge to rival's PM bid is spurned.,"jerusalem: prime minister benjamin netanyahu's party on tuesday challenged the legality of a bid by a rival rightist to head a new israeli government, but the last-gasp attempt at extending his leadership was rejected by president reuven rivlin. naftali bennett, netanyahu's former defence minister, announced on sunday (may 31) he would join a proposed alliance with centrist opposition leader yair lapid, serving as its premier first under a rotation deal. they have until wednesday midnight (2200 gmt) to present a final pact to rivlin, who handed lapid the task of forming a new government after netanyahu failed to do so in the wake of a close election on mar 23. in a letter to the legal counsels of the presidency and parliament, netanyahu's conservative likud said lapid was not authorised to cede the premiership to bennett. but rivlin's office said in response that there was no legal merit to likud's claim because lapid would be sworn in as ""alternate prime minister"", second to serve as premier as part of the rotation. it accepted likud's argument that lapid must provide the president with full details of the new government and not just announce that he has clinched a coalition deal. the lapid-bennett power-share may include other rightist politicians as well as liberal and centre-left parties.  israeli media have speculated it could also court parliamentary backing from a party that draws votes from israel's arab minority. that has prompted netanyahu to accuse bennett of imperiling israel as it contends with internal jewish-arab strife over last month's gaza conflict, the moribund peace process with the palestinians, and iran. netanyahu, 71, is the dominant political figure of his generation.  he was first elected prime minister in 1996 and he returned to power in 2009, holding the top office for more than a decade.  but he also faces a corruption trial for bribery, fraud and breach of trust charges he denies. divided countrya photo-shopped picture of bennett in an arab headdress, circulated on social media, prompted comparisons with attempts to discredit former prime minister yitzhak rabin, assassinated in 1995 by an ultranationalist opposed to his peacemaking. lapid said on monday that both he and bennett had been given extra security following threats to their safety.  both have said they want to bring together israelis from across the political divide and end hateful political discourse. ""a country that is divided and violent won't be able to deal with iran or with the economy.  a leadership that incites us against one another harms our ability to deal with the challenges we face,"" lapid said. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-06-01,COVID vaccination guidelines eased for pregnant women.,"singapore — covid-19 vaccination guidelines in singapore have been eased for pregnant women, breastfeeding women, cancer patients currently receiving treatment, and persons who have previously suffered severe skin allergy reactions to medications.  the expert committee on covid-19 vaccination (ec19v) has been monitoring evidence and developments around the world and has revised its guidelines accordingly, the multi-ministry taskforce (mtf) on the pandemic said at a virtual press briefing on monday (31 may). there was no evidence to suggest that the pfizer-biontech or moderna covid-19 vaccines may cause harm to pregnant women or their babies, the mtf stated. however, the committee noted that the amount of data collected on the population segment was still much smaller compared to data on the general population. it advised pregnant women to discuss the risks and benefits with their doctors to make an informed decision on the vaccination.  pregnant women will be able to register and book a vaccination appointment from 4 june, if they are part of the population group eligible for vaccination. similarly, the two vaccines have been deemed to be safe for breastfeeding women and there is no need to stop breastfeeding while receiving the jabs, the ec19v said.  cancer patients on active cancer treatment remain at an increased risk of complications from covid-19 but there was no evidence of any safety signals or increased rates of adverse events from mrna-based covid-19 vaccines, noted the authorities. director of medical services kenneth mak noted that moh had previously exercised ""considerable caution"" and advised that these patients complete their treatment before getting vaccinated.  ""at this time, we prefer for these patients to be vaccinated in a hospital setting where they can be better monitored for their health status.  and we will review later whether these conditions can be revised. ""persons with severe cutaneous adverse reactions (scar), or sever skin allergy reactions to medications, can also receive both vaccines, even though they were previously not recommended to do so.  scar includes stevens-johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, and drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome. ""these are very severe reactions that occur as a result of taking various types of medications,"" explained prof mak.  ""and if you have previously had such a severe allergic reaction to medications like antibiotics, you will now be eligible to receive your covid-19 vaccination. ""the ec19v is also reviewing safety data on persons with a history of anaphylaxis, to allow more to be safely vaccinated, it added.  the committee said it intends to complete the review in the next two weeks, and will set out guidelines allowing certain persons who have had previous history of anaphylaxis to be vaccinated using mrna vaccines safely. prof mak said, ""we hope that these adjustments to our guidance will offer vaccination opportunities for more people and allow them to benefit from the enhanced immune protection that vaccination offers.

severe reactions that occur as a result of taking various types of medications,"" explained prof mak.', '""and if you have previously had such a severe allergic reaction to medications like antibiotics, you will now be eligible to receive your covid-19 vaccination.', '""the ec19v is also reviewing safety data on persons with a history of anaphylaxis, to allow more to be safely vaccinated, it added.', 'the committee said it intends to complete the review in the next two weeks, and will set out guidelines allowing certain persons who have had previous history of anaphylaxis

            taipei (taiwan news) — foxconn technology group founder terry gou () on monday (may 31) indicated that he is pushing forward with his attempt to acquire 5 million doses of the pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccine directly from germany, with the total cost estimated to be nt$6. 3 billion (us$228 million). 
            in his latest update on his progress, gou wrote on facebook that ""everyone is continuing to work hard.  let's go, everybody!"" the previous evening, gou wrote that his yong lin foundation () is aware of taiwanese concerns about the vaccine and called on the public to rest assured that ""we will strive for the delivery,"" with the goal of completing the application within 72 hours. 
udn cited yong lin foundation director amanda liu () as saying monday that according to the authorities, documents for eight criteria set by the central epidemic command center (cecc) must be submitted in order to begin the process of acquiring vaccines.  liu said there are many steps involved in confirming the feasibility of the eight criteria. 
            she said that guo has given her team 72 hours to complete all the related work.  the deadline is wednesday (june 2), and her team is working hard to submit the application to competent authorities by that time, according to liu. 
            when hong kong purchased the vaccine from biontech, the cost was us$30 per dose.  for 5 million doses, this would come out to us$150 million. 
            however, this does not include the cost of transportation, cold chain logistics, storage, inspection, labeling, distribution, and administration.  once all of these are factored in, gou would find himself having to shell out at least us$228 million. 
            beyond the documentation required, the manufacturer must also coordinate directly with the government on transportation, storage, and other details that must be confirmed and prepared.  only after the eight required documents have been completed in full will the government consider the vaccine purchase application
            in another facebook post, gou said he would entrust the manufacturer with applying with the government and emphasized that he would be applying for 5 million doses of the ""german bnt vaccine. "" he said that if the application is approved, the doses ""will be shipped directly from germany to taiwan by air. ""
            gou pledged that he would not consider introducing vaccines made in china.  he then called on the public to ""not confuse the german-made bnt with chinese-made vaccines. ""
            however, gou did not address the fact that in march of last year, shanghai-based fosun international signed a deal with biontech that gave it exclusive rights to sell the vaccine in the ""greater china"" market, which includes taiwan.  it is unclear how any taiwanese government agency or organization would be able to bypass this agreement. 
            regarding applications from various organizations, health minister and cecc head chen shih-chung () on monday said that the food and drug administration has received four applications to purchase vaccines, while the cecc has received two.  however, he said none of these organizations have included all the required documentation. updated : 2021-06-01 23:57 gmt+08:00taiwan news  ©  2019 all rights reserved.

2021-06-01,Nestle seeks new strategy as 60% of products are unhealthy.,"food giant nestle announced monday that it is seeking to develop a new health strategy after an internal document made headlines around the globe as it showed that almost two-thirds of its products lack nutrition. an internal presentation circulated among top executives earlier this year revealed that more than 60% of nestle's mainstream food and drinks portfolio did not meet the ""recognized definition of health,"" the financial times (ft) reported. the presentation, seen by the ft, revealed that only 37% of nestle's food and beverages by revenues (not including products like pet food, baby food and specialized medical nutrition) achieved a rating of over 3. 5 under australia's five-star health rating system. among drinks except for plain coffee were found to be 96% ""unhealthy"" and candy and ice cream to be 99%. nestle, the owner of everything from chocolate to coffee and baby food brands, has for several years been reorganizing its activities to focus more on health and wellness as consumers increasingly snub frozen pizzas and sugary drinks. the swiss company has among other things been making a major push in vegetarian and vegan products. ""we have made significant improvements to our products,"" the nestle presentation said, according to the ft. but, it added, ""our portfolio still underperforms against external definitions of health in a landscape where regulatory pressure and consumer demands are skyrocketing. ""a nestle spokesperson told agence france-presse (afp) the company was currently ""working on a company-wide project to update its pioneering nutrition and health strategy. """"we are looking at our entire portfolio across the different phases of people's lives to ensure our products are helping meet their nutritional needs and supporting a balanced diet,"" she saidthe initial focus, she added, would be on ""assessing the part (of) our food and beverage portfolio that can be measured against external nutrition profiling systems,"" like the australian system. according to the ft, nestle is aiming to unveil its new strategy this year. quoting an unnamed person familiar with the situation, the paper suggested the company might drop products pushing down its health ratings such as confectionery items.

2021-06-01,"Sri Lanka ship fire finally extinguished; S'pore shipping firm to be sued for marine pollution, South Asia News & Top Stories.","read 3 articles daily and stand to win st rewards, including the st news tablet worth $398. spin the wheel for st read and win now. bangalore the fire aboard a singapore-registered container vessel off colombo port was finally extinguished on tuesday (june 1), after causing extensive marine pollution in sri lanka's waters. with the blaze finally put out after 12 days, the authorities said they were turning their attention to probing the cause of the fire and placing accountability for it. the x-press pearl is operated by the singapore-based x-press feeders.  flying a singapore flag, the ship was carrying 1,486 containers and had 25 tonnes of nitric acid, other chemicals and cosmetics on board. it was on its way to singapore from the port of hazira in india, via colombo, when the fire broke out. the company now faces criminal charges under sri lanka's marine pollution prevention act of 2008, and civil claims will be made subsequently as penalty for the pollution damage caused. ""from the very first day, we have been collecting data regarding the ship and the pollution.  after we settled the immediate issue of the fire and the safety of the crew, it is high time we take legal action,"" dr p.  b.  terney pradeep kumara, general manager of sri lanka's marine environment protection authority (mepa), told the straits times. mepa has lodged a complaint with the harbour police in colombo. a police spokesman said the police will start taking statements from the ship's captain and crew, now that they are out of quarantine, which was required under covid-19 protocols. x-press feeders said in a may 31 statement that ""select seafarers have been helping local police with their enquiries into the fire and are cooperating with investigators.  we will respect this process and not publicly discuss operational details until the investigation has been completed"". while the criminal investigation is ongoing, a damage assessment team from mepa is doing ""a scientific cost assessment"" of the destruction caused to marine resources and the coast, said dr kumara. ""we are focused on the ship not informing (the authorities about) the possible pollution, and compiling reports on the pollution they have caused.  normally, the ship captain is culpable,"" he added. since the ship burst into flames 12 days ago, there have been fears of an oil spill and chemical leaks from the containers. ""at the moment, the fire is under control and there is no sign of an oil spill,"" said mr dan malika gunasekera, a maritime lawyer in sri lanka and former executive director of the ceylon shipping corporation. he added that indian and dutch fire-fighting teams were working to cool the vessel down and take out the bunker oil. but the chemical dispersants used to douse the fire and toxic chemicals in the containers have already affected the sea and coast.

dr kumara said: ""the underwater area is still inaccessible because of the ship's condition and the water is also turbid there. ""the extent of the damage is still difficult to estimate.  ""it will take some months to fully assess it,"" he added. tiny plastic pellets called nurdles, used in plastics manufacturing, have also spilled from the burning ship and spread along sri lanka's western coastline. this kind of waste is challenging to clean up and dangerous to fish as it blocks their airways, and will be factored into the probe. mepa told afp that the plastic waste caused ""the worst beach pollution in our history"", and warned it could cause years of ecological damage.

apart from marine damage, the fisheries ministry is also assessing the expected losses to 4,500 fishermen and the seafood industry in negombo. fishing has been banned in an 80km stretch of the coast where the chemicals and pellets have washed up. after the greek oil carrier new diamond caught fire in september 2020 off the coast of sri lanka, mepa took legal action. the sri lankan attorney-general charged the ship's captain with causing an oil spill and sought a fine of us$1 million (s$1. 3 million), which the colombo high court reduced to us$65,000. that ship's owner, porto emporios shipping, was charged us$2. 4 million for the fire-fighting effort. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-06-01,Israel inches closer to government without Netanyahu.,"jerusalem: israeli nationalist hardliner naftali bennett said on sunday (may 30) that he would join apotential coalition governmentthat could end the rule of the country's longest-serving leader, prime minister benjamin netanyahu. lawmakers opposed to right-wing netanyahu have been in intense talks ahead of a wednesday deadline, as a ceasefire held following the latestdeadly military conflict with hamasin the gaza strip. netanyahu, 71, who faces trial on fraud, bribery and breach of trust charges, which he denies, has clung to power throughout a period of political turmoil that has seen four inconclusive elections in under two years. a march vote saw netanyahu's likud party gain the most seats, but he again failed to form a government. opposition leader and former tv anchor yair lapid now has until wednesday evening to build a rival coalition. lapid, 57, is seeking a diverse alliance which the israeli media has dubbed a bloc for ""change"", which would include bennett as well as arab-israeli lawmakers. in his determination to bring down the hawkish prime minister, lapid has offered to share power and let bennett, 49, serve the first term in a rotating premiership. bennett, after meeting members of his religious-nationalist yamina party, said on sunday: ""i will do everything to form a national unity government with my friend yair lapid. ""lapid and bennett's parties started talks on sunday night to formalise the deal, they said in a statement. religious-nationalist yamina won seven seats in mar 23 elections, but one member has refused to join an anti-netanyahu coalition. netanyahu, who has been in office for 12 consecutive years after an earlier three-year term, in his own televised address minutes later lashed out at the plan, calling it ""a danger for the security of israel"". ""desperate position""he had earlier on sunday tried to cling to power by offering his own, last-ditch power-sharing agreement to several former allies including bennett. he warned that israel would otherwise be ruled by a dangerous ""left-wing"" alliance. lapid has until 11. 59 pm local time on wednesday (4. 59am on thursday, singapore time) to build a coalition of at least 61 deputies, a majority in the 120-seat knesset. a lapid government would also include the centrist blue and white party of netanyahu's rival benny gantz and the hawkish new hope party of his former ally gideon saar. avigdor lieberman's pro-settlement yisrael beitenu party as well as historically powerful labour and the dovish meretz party would also join. the shaky arrangement would need the backing of some arab-israeli lawmakers of palestinian descent in order to pass a confirmation vote in parliament. the intense talks follow weeks of escalating tensions between israel and the palestinians, including a deadly 11-day exchange of rocket fire from gaza and devastating israeli airstrikes. the war with hamas that ended with a may 21 truce, as well as violence in the occupied west bank and in mixed jewish-arab towns in israel, initially appeared to leave netanyahu more likely to hold onto power. but political scientist gayil talshir at hebrew university told afp on sunday that israel was now ""closer than ever"" to a coalition of change, adding: ""netanyahu is in a desperate position. ""netanyahu's likud party won 30 seats in the march elections, but failed to form a governing coalition after his far-right partners refused to sit with arab factions or receive their support. lapid, whose party won 17 seats, was then given four weeks to form a government. netanyahu had previously pushed for yet another election israel's fifth in a little more than two years. more elections?on sunday, netanyahu offered his own proposal of a rotation agreement with bennett and saar.  but saar on twitter said that he remained committed to ""replacing the netanyahu regime"". netanyahu in a video then called on saar and bennett to ""come now, immediately"" to meet him and join a three-way rotation government, warning that they were in a ""crucial moment for the security, character and future of the state of israel"". lapid's ""change"" coalition also still faced several obstacles. some right-wing lawmakers object to a partnership with politicians from israel's arab minority, who make up about a fifth of the population. the recent gaza conflict sparked inter-communal clashes between jewish and arab israelis in mixed cities. arab politicians have also been divided about joining a government headed by bennett, who supports expanding israeli settlements in the occupied west bank, where palestinians hope to create a state. even with support from an arab party, a new coalition in israel is unlikely to reverse years of israeli settlement construction or bring peace any time soon with hamas in gaza. if the anti-netanyahu camp does not manage to form a government on time, a majority of 61 lawmakers could vote to ask the president to name a new premier. another scenario would see the country return, yet again, to the polls. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

""all our members' ecashback and credits are safely stored with us, and you will still be able to use them in your purchases with us,"" the firm said. the retailer added it had strengthened its firewall and the system's security after the incident, and had suspended its website temporarily to conduct more tests and the firewall upgrade. apologising for the potential breach, audio house advised customers who receive any spam e-mails from altdos not to respond to it. the company also urged customers not to spread unverified information about the incident that could bolster the hacking group's efforts. those who need help can contact audio house.  altdos had previously claimed responsibility for hacking vhive. the furniture retailer had said its server was hacked on march 23. compromised information included customers' names, physical and e-mail addresses and mobile numbers, but did not include identification numbers or financial information, said the furniture retailer. in an e-mail to affected customers in early april, altdos said it managed to hack into vhive three times in nine days and claimed to have stolen information related to more than 300,000 customers and nearly 600,000 transaction records. the group said it would leak 20,000 customer records daily, until its demands to vhive's management were met. cyber-security experts had previously said personal details stolen by hackers could be used by cyber criminals to, among other things, send victims personalised phishing e-mails that would allow them to steal passwords or drop ransomware to lock up digital files until the crooks are paid. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.
