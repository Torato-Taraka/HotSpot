2021-05-28,Liverpool sign Konate after triggering release clause worth upwards of £35m.,"other english editionsliverpool have triggered the release clause in ibrahima konate's contract at rb leipzig, with a five-year contract agreed with the french defender. the 22-year-old has been heavily linked with the reds for some time, and a big-money move to england has now been pushed through. a long-term deal has been agreed with the highly-rated defender and he is all set to open a new chapter in his career at anfield. upon completing a switch to england, konate told the reds' official website: ""i'm really happy to be joining such a massive club like liverpool. ""it's a really exciting moment for me and my family and i am really looking forward to meeting my new team-mates, the staff and getting started on this new chapter. ""right now, my focus is on the u21 european championships with france, but after this competition i know i will be joining one of the best teams in the world and that gives me a great feeling. ""i have worked very hard for many years to get to this point, but i would like to say a big thank you to everyone at rb leipzig and all the people i worked with there – the coaches, my team-mates, the staff and especially the fans. ""your support helped me grow up during my time there and become not only a better player, but a better man and i will always be grateful for it. ""konate's release clause at leipzig was worth in excess of £35 million ($50m), with liverpool investing heavily in securing his services. all of the relevant paperwork is now in place, with signatures added where required. a medical has also been completed, with a top target snapped up early in the summer by jurgen klopp.    klopp saw best-laid plans decimated by injuries in 2020-21, with his defensive ranks feeling the full force of those blows. virgil van dijk, joe gomez and joel matip were among those to take in lengthy spells on the sidelines, forcing academy graduates to be promoted and fresh faces to be drafted in. ozan kabak was among those acquired in january, in a loan agreement with schalke, but an £18m ($26m) purchase option will not be taken up there. with konate on his way to merseyside, klopp must now decide what to do with a number of other options at his disposal. rhys williams and nat phillips impressed during a late surge for champions league qualification, but could both be loaned out in 2021-22, while a decision also needs to be made on the future of winter arrival ben davies who is yet to take in an appearance for the club. konate has figured prominently on klopp's recruitment radar ever since the decision was taken to bring in another centre-half. alternative options were, however, mulled over, with liverpool eager to ensure that they were not solely reliant on plan a. brighton defender ben white, who has made england's preliminary squad for this summer's european championship, is another that the reds considered, along with marseille star duje caleta-car.    copyright © 2021 goal (singapore) all rights reserved.  the information contained in goal (singapore) may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed

                    wednesday, 26 may 2021
                singapore (the straits times/ann): convinced he was taking an x-ray via the phone, as instructed by who he thought was a police officer, the student posed topless, blindfolded and gagged, while on a video call. the 21-year-old believed he was speaking to a police officer from china, who had told him there was an outstanding warrant against him for money laundering offences. but the ""officer"" was actually a scammer, who then sent a recording of the student blindfolded and gagged to his parents in china, demanding they pay a ransom of 6 million yuan (s$1. 2 million). the scammers had contacted the student earlier this month, and convinced him he was under investigation.  besides getting him to pose for the ""x-ray"", they also told him to cease all contact with his friends and family. the scammers then told a 33-year-old man here to pass the student a mobile phone and sim card.  the man also booked a hotel room for the student to stay in. it is believed the man, who has been arrested by the police, received $1,000 from the scammers to do so. from the hotel, the student was put in touch with a 61-year-old man here.  he was then offered temporary accommodation at the man's home. this man is also being investigated. preliminary investigations by the police found that both the men were themselves victims of the scam.  in the case of the 61-year-old, the scammers had allegedly told him the student was an important witness. after the student had initially stopped contacting his family and friends, his parents in china made a police report on may 16.  they received the ransom demand on may 20, but did not pay up. later that day, the police here found the student safe at the residence of the 61-year-old man. speaking to the media on tuesday (may 25), the student said he was not harmed throughout the ruse, but wanted to warn other foreign students studying in singapore to be wary. he said: ""the reason why i believed the scammers was that they had some of my personal information.  i've heard some of my friends have had similar experiences, but i never thought it would happen to me. ""last year, close to $40 million was lost here to scammers impersonating officials from china.  this was despite there being a slight decrease in the number of cases from 456 in 2019 to 443 last year. in one case, the scammers made off with some $4. 2 million. superintendent of police steven tan, head of anti-scam investigation at the commercial affairs department, advised members of the public to hang up on unsolicited phone calls when in doubt, and to check with the police. he said: ""the china police, interpol and other overseas law enforcement agencies have no jurisdiction or powers to conduct operations in singapore.  they also have no powers to ask members of the public to help with any form of investigation without the approval of the singapore government. ""those convicted of cheating can be jailed for up to 10 years and fined.  those convicted of money laundering can be jailed for up to 10 years and/or fined up to $500,000.  the straits times/asia news network

2021-05-28,Opinion.,"president biden took an important but limited step wednesday toward a genuine investigation into the origins of covid-19.  he issued an order directing his intelligence agencies to ""redouble their efforts"" to look into the two competing hypotheses about the source of the pandemic (a random viral spillover in nature or an accident at one of the chinese labs studying bat coronaviruses in wuhan).  but this represents just one aspect of a growing u. s.  government and congressional effort to finally try — as best we can —  to get to the bottom of how the pandemic started. multiple senior administration officials told me that biden's statement, which came the day after china publicly refused to cooperate with further world health organization investigations, was meant to signal a new, broader phase of the u. s.  inquiry.  after receiving an initial u. s.  intelligence community assessment two weeks ago as part of his president's daily brief, these officials said, biden decided to declassify some of it and send the intel community back to do more digging.  but now he's also including a range of other federal institutions. over the next 90 days, this investigation could and should examine any and all information on the wuhan institute of virology held by the u. s.  national institutes of health, including the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases, the u. s.  agency for international development, the defense department, the department of homeland security and the national science foundation.  the list also includes the nonprofit organization ecohealth alliance, which channeled u. s.  funding to the wuhan lab. this expanded scope will, it's hoped, enable the intelligence community to do better than simply claim there's not enough evidence to make a high-confidence assessment in either direction.  but that's not going to be the end of the process, not by a long shot. full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic""we are not saying that in 90 days we will have an answer or the answer, we're saying in 90 days we are going to have an update, and then we will see where we go from there,"" a senior administration official told me.  ""this is a commitment to redouble our efforts and be as transparent as we can. ""biden's officials acknowledge he acted in part due to rising public and congressional pressure to explore the lab accident theory, an effort supported by an ever-growing pile of circumstantial evidence and an ever-growing list of top scientists.  but they insist biden himself always believed the lab accident theory was plausible and needed investigation.  even so, there's concern on capitol hill that the white house may use the new investigation to thwart several ongoing inquiries by lawmakers.  and republicans still doubt that biden is willing to exert significant pressure on beijing. on tuesday, the senate unanimously passed an amendment that would ban all u. s.  government funding to the wuhan institute of virology, where — according to both the trump and biden administrations —  chinese scientists were conducting secret coronavirus research with the chinese military and where researchers got sick with covid-like symptoms.  in the house, democratic leaders are now openly calling for a public investigation into the lab leak theory. sen.  marco rubio (r-fla. ) told me he is preparing sanctions legislation to push for a transparent forensic investigation into the wuhan lab and ""impose costs if beijing doesn't allow one. "" lawmakers also want to probe the failures of the u. s.  intelligence agencies, including why they were caught flat-footed   when the pandemic hit: why did they have no idea what was going on inside this network of chinese labs conducting risky research? and that obviously can't be part of the intelligence community's own investigation. some say there's little likelihood that the intelligence community or congress will be able to find a conclusive answer on the lab leak theory in 90 days — if ever.  biden alluded to this possibility in his statement, saying beijing's actions to cover up and conceal events in wuhan early on ""will always hamper any investigation into the origin of covid-19. ""even if ironclad proof can't be found, that doesn't absolve us of the responsibility to keep looking.  along the way we need to completely rethink how we manage oversight of these chinese labs and all the u. s.  labs that work with them.  the answers may be complicated.  but if it should turn out that most of the evidence points to the wuhan labs, are lab leak skeptics really going to propose we do nothing and just wait for the next pandemic?put simply, it has become amply clear that these chinese labs, which have a record of safety lapses, operate with little transparency and zero accountability, which means they present an ongoing risk that must be mitigated.  the intelligence community's job is to collect intelligence.  it's the policymakers and the legislators who will have to use that intelligence to formulate a response in the form of policies and laws. some say pursuing the lab leak investigation risks upsetting complex and fragile u. s. -china relations.  well, if uncovering the truth about 591,000 american deaths doesn't warrant risking offending the delicate sensibilities of the chinese communist party, what would? there's no statute of limitations on 3 million deaths worldwide.  this is not going away.  this is not about ""blaming china.

program, according to the immigration services agency. those aiming to obtain ""specified skilled worker"" status can extend their stay up to a year, it said.  the new category was created in 2019 as japan increasingly relies on foreign workers to make up for its aging and declining workforce. the government also said two myanmar diplomats in tokyo who were dismissed by their country's military junta for supporting the anti-coup movement can keep their diplomatic visas issued by the ousted government of aung san suu kyi. also friday, the u. n.  special envoy for myanmar, christine schraner burgener, met with japanese foreign minister toshimitsu motegi and discussed support for an effort by the association of southeast asian nations to hold a dialogue of all stakeholders on stopping the violence in myanmar. burgener said she has been in consultation with all parties and asean leaders and hopes to be able to give more details in two to three weeks. the feb.  1 coup reversed years of progress toward democracy in myanmar after five decades of harsh military rule.  it was met with widespread popular opposition that the military has tried to silence through force, including killing protesters and imprisoning activists and journalists. the most important news stories of the day, curated by post editors and delivered every morning. by signing up you agree to our terms of use and

2021-05-28,"New scam in S'pore asking borrowers to make payment before getting loans cost victims $200,000, Singapore News & Top Stories.","read 3 articles daily and stand to win st rewards, including the st news tablet worth $398. spin the wheel for st read and win now. singapore people were cheated of more than $200,000 by a new type of loan scam in the first four months of this year, with at least 20 police reports made. the police issued an advisory on wednesday (may 26) warning the public of it. the scam starts with victims receiving unsolicited text messages or coming across websites or advertisements offering loans. when victims respond, they are redirected to a whatsapp chat, during which scammers ask for their personal particulars to ""process"" the loan application. the scammers then send fake letters or e-mails, supposedly from banks or government agencies such as the state courts or the monetary authority of singapore, seeking payment for processing or transfer fees. ""these letters could indicate that the processing fee or tax payment would be required under specific regulations before the loan could be disbursed,"" the police said.  ""victims only realised that they had been scammed when they did not receive the loan. ""last month, the police had said that more than $3. 9 million had been lost in the first four months of the year to a scam in which conmen posed as singapore high court or interpol officials. in recent months, the police have also warned of a text message scam advertising fake jobs and one in which people receive a text message claiming that their bank accounts have been suspended. the overall crime rate in singapore was pushed to its highest in more than 10 years last year, with a record number of scams reported, climbing 65 per cent from 2019.  with more internet traffic, many of these were e-commerce scams. the police on wednesday reminded the public that licensed moneylenders are not allowed to approach potential borrowers via text messages, phone calls or social media platforms.  a fully online loan transaction is also not allowed, and licensed moneylenders must meet borrowers at the approved place of business to verify their identity before granting loans. any administrative fee will also not be sought from the borrower before the loan is dispensed, much less in payment to any government agency.  any such fee should instead be deducted from the loan principal. people are advised to ignore or block and report such messages.  they should not provide personal information such as their nric, singpass or bank account details to anyone. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-05-28,"Victoria state in lockdown after ‘highly-infectious’ Covid-19 outbreak, Latest World News.","sydney australia's second-most populous state of victoria will enter a one-week covid-19 lockdown forcing its near seven million residents to stay home except for essential business, as the authorities struggle to contain a highly-infectious outbreak. ""we are dealing with a highly infectious strain of the virus, a variant of concern, which is running faster than we have ever recorded,"" victoria state acting premier james merlino told reporters in melbourne, the state capital. ""unless something drastic happens, this will become increasingly uncontrollable. ""mr merlino said contact tracers have identified more than 10,000 primary and secondary contacts who will need to quarantine, test and self isolate, adding ""that number will continue to grow and change"". the fresh cluster of infections in melbourne detected early this week swelled to 26 yesterday after 12 new cases overnight, while the number of virus-exposed sites rose above 150. victoria state chief health officer brett sutton said he ""absolutely expects"" more positive cases to emerge in the coming days as the variant, first detected in india, was likely to be more virulent than the original strains. the current strain can take one day to infect another person compared with earlier strains, which can take about five or six days, mr merlino said. under the lockdown, from 11. 59pm yesterday until june 3, people will be allowed to leave their homes only for essential work, healthcare, grocery shopping, exercise or to get a coronavirus vaccination. several infected contacts have visited crowded hot spots that included sports stadiums and one of the largest shopping centres in the country, raising concerns of a significant outbreak days ahead of the winter season. the lockdown comes just days after the authorities reinstated coronavirus curbs for melbourne, limiting gathering sizes and making masks mandatory in restaurants, hotels and other indoor locations until june 4.

2021-05-28,"IMDA orders offensive poll on female Islamic teachers to be removed from social media platforms, Singapore News & Top Stories.","read 3 articles daily and stand to win st rewards, including the st news tablet worth $398. spin the wheel for st read and win now. singapore the authorities have asked that a poll to rate the attractiveness of ustazah, or female islamic religious teachers, with a view to committing sexual violence against them be removed from social media platforms here. on friday (may 28), the infocomm media development authority (imda) said the poll constitutes prohibited content under singapore's internet code of practice, and has no place here. the poll on social media platform mewe came to light on wednesday, and is currently under police investigation. ""a poll on local female asatizah (religious teachers). . .  promotes sexual violence or sexual activity involving coercion or non-consent.  such content is unacceptable and has no place in singapore,"" said imda. it added that it has contacted mewe to remove the offending poll if it still remains on the platform.  imda has also spoken to other social media platforms to ensure that the post does not surface on their platforms. minister for communications and information josephine teo said in a facebook post on friday that the poll was ""revolting"", and that she condemned it in the ""strongest terms"". ""whoever is behind this isn't just trying to be funny.  they have designed a deliberate exercise to demean women, and especially women who have dedicated themselves to upholding their faith,"" said mrs teo, who is also chairman of the people's action party's women's wing. the mewe poll was first highlighted by ustaz muhammad zahid mohd zin late on wednesday in an instagram post.  mewe allows users to post comments, start polls, message one another and have group discussions. many netizens, including other asatizah, have since uploaded similar screenshots of the post to criticise it.  the list shows at least 12 asatizah being ranked, with 1,005 participating in the poll. the straits times understands that about 20 to 30 asatizah were ranked in it. the islamic religious council of singapore (muis) said on thursday that it was aware of the post, which had caused ""immense distress"" to the individuals involved, and was very concerned by it. the council has lodged a police report to expedite investigations into the matter and ""bring the perpetrators to justice"". other muslim groups have also spoken out against the poll.  the singapore muslim women's association said on thursday that it stood in solidarity with the women who are affected by the poll, which it called ""deplorable and unacceptable"". the group said that it was shocked at how more than 1,000 people had voted in the poll, and it urged the authorities to investigate the matter thoroughly so that the perpetrators are held accountable and counselled. several netizens have alleged that those who started the poll were students studying to become asatizah, and have urged muis to not accredit them. the singaporean students welfare assembly in egypt told the straits times that it had published a letter on wednesday to show that it does not condone such acts, and that it stands with the people who have been affected. beyond the hijab, a website focusing on the experiences of muslim women in singapore, said on its twitter account: ""we are very disturbed by the fact that the group is allegedly comprised mostly of undergrads of islamic studies and therefore potential future teachers. ""this is not behaviour that teachers, as people in positions of power, should have.  it would not be safe for (their) students. ""mrs teo joins several leaders who have spoken out strongly against the poll on thursday, including president halimah yacob, minister-in-charge of muslim affairs masagos zulkifli and minister in the prime minister's office maliki osman. she added that her ministry will continue to work on protecting women and girls from online harm. ""whether offline or online, respect and safety for women must be the norm.  there should be no question about it,"" she said.  parliamentary secretary for communications and information rahayu mahzam said she deeply appreciated the clear stance from imda that offensive content like the poll has no place in society here.  noting that there is much online harm faced by women and girls that often goes unaddressed, she pointed out that the ministry has been working on a singapore together alliance for action workgroup to discuss, co-create solutions and act against such harm.  ""an overarching theme that surfaced during our discussions is the importance of cultivating a culture of respect for singaporean women both online and offline,"" said ms rahayu.  ""behaviours that perpetuate sexual harassment must be condemned.  i hope singaporeans, both men and women, will work towards a safer and more responsible online culture in singapore and with mutual respect for all.

2021-05-28,"US' Indo-Pacific Strategy Will Lead To Division, Chaos In Area: China.","china and the us are currently at loggerheads over a host of issues (representational)china's military today criticised the biden administration for continuing the trump era ""indo-pacific strategy"", saying the us should not form ""cliques"" or provoke ""new cold war"" featuring bloc confrontation. no strategy should instigate countries to establish selective and exclusive military alliances, to gang up or to create the ""new cold war"" featuring bloc confrontation, and the zero-sum game will only lead to more division, antagonism and chaos, senior colonel tan kefei, spokesperson for the chinese ministry of national defence, said at an online press conference. he made the remarks while responding to a question that us president joe biden has continued to promote the ""indo-pacific strategy"" formulated by his predecessor donald trump to deter china and made frequent military provocations against beijing. his comments come a week after a us navy guided-missile destroyer sailed through the taiwan strait on may 19, challenging china's claims over the area as beijing claims taiwan as part of its mainland. the chinese navy, which rushed its ships to pursue the american warship, accused the us of resorting to provocative moves. the us navy's 7th fleet said in a statement, ""the ship's transit through the taiwan strait demonstrates the us commitment to a free and open indo-pacific. ""senior colonel tan did not directly refer to the quadrilateral alliance or quad comprising the us, india, australia and japan while accusing washington of forming cliques.  however, the chinese foreign ministry has in recent weeks stepped up attacks on the four-nation alliance, terming it as an exclusive clique portraying china as a challenge and sowing discord between beijing and regional countries. senior colonel tan, while claiming that china always holds that no strategy should go against the historical trend of peace and development, or deliberately hype up conflict and confrontation, said that intensifying military presence and highlighting military competition will only aggravate regional tensions and endanger world peace and stability. ""no strategy should harm the welfare of people in regional countries, or put them in a dangerous situation.  seeking one's own selfish interests and unilateral absolute security will only do harm to others and lose their support,"" he was quoted as saying by the chinese military online. referring to the reported comments by a us defence department official that the us government intends to put in place more defence hotlines with china to manage security risks and prevent potential conflicts, the chinese defence ministry spokesperson said that for a long time, the chinese and american militaries have always maintained communication through multiple channels, including the direct line between the two defence ministries. ""we believe that its purpose is to enhance trust, reduce misgivings, manage crises, and prevent conflicts.  the us side should not, on the one hand, claim to put up new defence hotlines, while on the other hand keep ramping up military deployments in the asian pacific region, frequently conduct close-in reconnaissance on china, and even deliberately initiate dangerous circumstances where aircraft and vessels nearly collide,"" he said. he said that china advises the us side to keep their words and match their deeds accordingly, display sincerity, work with the chinese side toward the same goal, and push forward the healthy and stable development of mil-to-mil relations by intensifying dialogue and communication and properly managing divergences. china and the us are currently at loggerheads over a host of issues as the biden administration continued the tough policy to contain china initiated by trump, targeting beijing on xinjiang, hong kong and taiwan. biden beefed-up the us-china policy by uniting us allies like the uk, the eu and japan.  he also hosted the first quadrilateral summit of the emerging alliance called quad in march which included the us, australia, japan and india.

2021-05-28,A choppy market likely to persist for ‘most of the summer’: Tematica Research CIO.,"chris versace, tematica research chief investment officer, joins yahoo finance to discuss the outlook on the market and inflation concerns. john macphee, the jed foundation executive director & ceo, joins yahoo finance to discuss&nbsp;the importance of mental health programs and resources within schools. myles udland breaks down the morning brief, which details how vital the may jobs report in determining transitory inflation will be and if the fed will be compelled to change its stance in the market. !smart759 ,5%,smart!u. s.  consumer prices surged in april, with a measure of underlying inflation blowing past the federal reserve's 2% target and posting its largest annual gain since 1992, reflecting pent-up demand as the economy reopens.   the strong inflation readings reported by the commerce department on friday had been widely anticipated as the covid-19 pandemic's grip eases, thanks to vaccinations, and will have no impact on monetary policy.   fed chair jerome powell has repeatedly stated that higher inflation will be transitory, with supply chains expected to adapt and become more efficient. while commodity prices fell after chinese warnings over onshore speculation, ""the fundamental path in key commodities such as oil, copper and soybeans remains orientated towards incremental tightness in h2, with scant evidence of a supply response sufficient to derail this bull market. ""  the market is beginning to reflect this, as copper prices are increasingly driven by western manufacturing data rather their chinese counterparts, it said.   ""this is a role reversal from the bull market of the 2000's, with china now the incumbent consumer as the u. s.  was when emerging chinese demand squeezed out marginal u. s consumers,"" goldman said. (bloomberg) -- credit suisse group ag executives ignored warnings from colleagues about troubled steel tycoon sanjeev gupta as they channeled $1. 2 billion of client funds to his businesses, according to people familiar with the matter. bankers in credit suisse's commodity trade-finance unit blacklisted gupta's liberty commodities ltd.  in 2016 because they suspected some of its deals weren't legitimate, the people said.  when they learned about two years later that the bank was lending to his companies through a suite of investment funds, which eventually grew to $10 billion, they flagged their worries to leaders in compliance and the division that housed the loans, one of the people said. the disclosure that credit suisse may have put clients at risk despite internal concerns over gupta's businesses adds a new twist to the debacle stemming from the march implosion of greensill capital, the finance firm at the center of the three-way relationship. investigations, lawsuitsthe u. k.  serious fraud office is now investigating gupta's group of companies for suspected fraud, including in its financing deals with greensill, according to a may 14 statement.  credit suisse has sued to force gupta's liberty commodities into insolvency and has since shut the funds that made the loans and launched an internal investigation.  investors are staring at losses as the bank confronts embarrassing lawsuits. ""we are currently focusing our efforts on recovering our investors' money,"" will bowen, a spokesman for credit suisse in london, said in an emailed statement, adding that the bank's internal probe will focus on ""all of the issues"" linked to the funds.  ""we are committed to learning the lessons and will share the relevant lessons learnt at the appropriate time. ""andrew mitchell, a spokesman for the gupta family group alliance, or gfg alliance, a collective of businesses linked to gupta including liberty commodities, denied any wrongdoing. the greensill saga represents just one of the two disasters that rocked credit suisse in the first half of 2021.  since greensill began unraveling, the bank has announced a $5. 5 billion hit from the blowup at archegos capital management. apologiesformer chairman urs rohner apologized to shareholders and his successor, antonio horta-osorio, who arrived at the end of april, has promised a sweeping strategy review. chief executive officer thomas gottstein, who was head of the division that oversaw trade finance, wasn't aware of the internal concerns about gupta that had prompted the bank to cut him off, according to a person familiar with the matter. employees at the trade-finance unit, which lends money for the buying and selling of commodities, cut ties with gupta in 2016 after becoming skeptical toward his liberty commodities, the people said.  they distrusted the documents the company provided, triggering doubts about its transactions, they said.  in one example reported by bloomberg, the company had presented another bank with what seemed to be duplicate shipping receipts.  credit suisse's commodity team had stopped working with gupta after identifying suspicious shipments while the bank's credit-structuring team lobbied against the greensill funds, the wall street journal reported in april. a spokesman for gupta has denied any wrongdoing. banking tiesliberty commodities pledged assets to credit suisse as security for borrowings in 2013 but by early 2016, all such commitments had been extinguished, indicating that the financing relationship had ceased, u. k.  companies house filings show.  and while gupta's company listed the swiss bank as one of its lenders in its 2014 annual report, it didn't in the following year's report, which is dated may 2016, according to the filings. their counterparts at other banks, including macquarie group ltd.  and sberbank pjsc, halted trading with liberty commodities around the same time because of similar concerns; goldman sachs group inc.  also stopped in 2016, bloomberg has reported. nevertheless, executives at credit suisse's asset-management division -- which creates investment products for clients and charges a fee for overseeing them -- began arranging a suite of funds focused on supply-chain finance in 2017.  the entities bought securitized loans packaged by greensill, a firm created by australian businessman lex greensill.  much of the debts were linked to gupta's businesses. warningsofficials at the commodity trade-finance unit were concerned when they found out about the funds' links to gupta and took their fears to thomas grotzer, general counsel for the bank's swiss division.  they also warned luc mathys and lukas haas, the bankers who helped oversee the trades at the asset-management unit. grotzer was promoted last month to interim global head of compliance at credit suisse.  he didn't respond to requests for comment.  mathys, head of fixed-income at the asset-management division, and haas, a portfolio manager, were put on temporary leave in march.  neither responded to requests for comment. the bank pushed ahead with the funds and marketed them to investors as being made up of short-term debt secured on invoices, assets considered so safe that credit suisse gave the largest vehicle its lowest rating for risk.  yet part of the loans were linked to mere possible future revenues. other parts of the bank continued working with gupta as well.  credit suisse's investment bankers were due to lead an initial public offering for liberty's u. s.  steel arm, which was ultimately pulled, according to a statement from the company.  gupta also announced that the swiss bank would finance his planned acquisition of thyssenkrupp ag's steel unit, which fell apart earlier this year. credit suisse has so far recouped about $5. 9 billion of the $10 billion in these supply-chain funds, but it remains unclear how much will be returned ultimately to investors.  loans to gupta's businesses are among a batch of debts that are the ""principal sources of valuation uncertainty,"" the bank said earlier this month. liberty commodities's external legal advisors investigated ""alleged rumors concerning the paperwork"" it used in 2019, according to mitchell, the spokesman for gfg alliance.  they found no evidence to substantiate the rumors, nor was the company ""ever subject to further complaints or proceedings,"" he said. ""lcl has ongoing banking relationships with separate financial institutions,"" mitchell said, referring to liberty commodities.  ""the trade-finance market has been hugely challenging for all but the very largest commodities traders in recent years.  nevertheless, no financial institution has been left out of pocket as a result of lending money to lcl.  on the contrary, they have received substantial commercial returns.

(bloomberg) -- the manager of nigeria's biggest pension fund is teeing up millions in financing for the renewables sector but it's also embracing solar energy for the good of its own business. standard bank group ltd. 's nigerian unit is aiming to run nearly half its offices on solar by 2022 to cut down on energy costs and dependence on diesel-powered generators in the west african nation, which suffers from acute power shortages and frequent blackouts. stanbic ibtc holdings plc's shift to solar-powered systems will enable it to cut diesel cost for generators by about 20%, omolola fashesin, its head of sustainability, said in an emailed response to questions.  the fuel makes up a significant portion of spending on its banking premises that accounted for about 6. 3% of its operating expenses -- excluding staff costs -- in 2020. the bank has 175 business offices in africa's largest economy, all of which have to be supported by diesel-powered generators. stanbic ibtc also plans to set aside $100 million for lending to local companies in the renewables sector over the next three years to help boost adoption of cleaner forms of energy, according to fashesin. ""the prospects for solar companies in nigeria are good but it does require a significant amount of capital,"" she said.  ""there are opportunities for banks to partner with these companies to provide lending. ""energy goalsstanbic ibtc's parent, africa's largest bank by assets, agreed this month to set targets for reducing its exposure to fossil fuels after initially rejecting a demand from a group of fund managers to include a resolution on climate-change goals at its may 27 annual general meeting. the greenhouse gas emissions associated with financial institutions' investing, lending and underwriting activities are more than 700 times higher, on average, than their direct emissions, according to a report published in april by climate nonprofit cdp. lenders and businesses in africa's largest economy routinely run generators for their offices because of the unreliability of power supply from the national grid, which provides only about 4,500 megawatts of electricity for more than 200 million people. stanbic ibtc is in talks with development financial institutions including international finance corp.  and us international development finance corp.  for on-lending facilities to nigerian firms investing in renewables, fashesin said. nigeria has pledged to cut carbon emissions 20% by 2030 under the paris climate agreement as part of an effort to overcome its energy challenges. while the government is encouraging private sector investments in renewables, it's also injecting 10% of the 2. 3 trillion naira ($5. 6 billion) intended to spur a recovery from the coronavirus pandemic toward providing solar power for households. more stories like this are available on bloomberg. comsubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source. ©2021 bloomberg l. p. 1. 75%,18,60,!deutsche bank's multi-year overhaul is ahead of plan and remains its primary focus, chief executive christian sewing told shareholders on thursday, promising an era of more sustainable profit.   the bank's annual shareholder meeting, held online due to the coronavirus pandemic, took place in a more relaxed atmosphere than in recent years, a reflection of the lender's return to profit and rising share price.   three years into its restructuring, sewing said germany's largest bank wasn't over the finish line. the activist investor said cryptocurrency would endure but not necessarily all the current digital.

""regulators ""will be a little more friendly over time"" toward cryptocurrencies out of fear of missing out on the innovation provided by the sector, wood said at the consensus 2021 conference organized by coindesk. read more: cathie wood's bad spring is a blip when future is so magnificentthe most high-profile recent broadside came from china.  a push to rein in cryptocurrency mining there was partly triggered by concern over a surge in illicit coal extraction to deliver the power needed by the server farms underpinning bitcoin.  billionaire elon musk also highlighted environmental risks in suspending bitcoin payments at tesla inc. wood, founder of ark investment management llc, said that the focus on green factors likely led to a pause in institutional buying of bitcoin.  she has previously said she expects the token to surge longer term. bitcoin's questionable environmental profile has eroded the argument that the token is bound to lure more mainstream investment, whether as an online store of value akin to digital bullion or for more speculative purposes. musk has backed an effort to shine a light on energy consumption by north american miners, including planned renewable use.  but it will take years for many of the largest miners to recalibrate where they source their energy. ""half of the solution is understanding the problem,"" wood said.  ""this auditing of what miners, certainly in north america, are willing to do around how much of their electricity usage is generated by renewables is going to bring that topic into stark relief, and will encourage an acceleration in the adoption of renewables beyond which otherwise would have taken the place. ""ark investment management published a report last month saying cryptocurrency mining can drive investment in solar power and make more renewable energy available to the grid. capital-gains taxon the stock market outlook, wood said concerns about higher u. s.  capital-gains taxes had hurt ""high-volatility, high-multiple stocks,"" but added those fears have eased amid increased chances of gridlock in washington. ark's funds have faced a tough time of late as a wave of selling swept across former market darlings in the technology sector amid a switch to less richly valued segments of the equity market.  the firm's flagship ark innovation etf has slumped about 28% from its february peak. bitcoin was trading around the $38,000 level as of 12:41 p. m.  in tokyo, down some 40% from a record in mid-april.

(bloomberg) -- hedge funds often measure their investments in minutes, not decades; but for anchorage capital group, its long-held stake in metro-goldwyn-mayer studios inc.  is proving that patience can also be profitable. the new york-based money manager stands to make roughly $2 billion on its investment in the film and tv producer, one that began almost 11 years ago with mgm in bankruptcy court.  amazon. com inc.  agreed to buy the company for $8. 45 billion wednesday, a price that includes just under $2 billion in debt. the deal is in many ways a vindication for kevin ulrich, the former goldman sachs group inc.  trader who co-founded anchorage in 2003 and was part of a group of distressed debt investors that took control of mgm as it went through the restructuring process.  in recent years the stake looked to be an albatross for the fund, one that came with significant drama in its own right. ulrich brought in and later fired a high-profile chief executive officer, resisted efforts by activist investor carl icahn to take control, and held out for a bigger payday after years of considering various exit strategies.  by selling now, as demand for media content from entertainment and technology companies alike is booming, he's proving his long-held faith in the investment was justified.

""a representative for anchorage declined to comment. when ulrich first invested in mgm, he was new to hollywood.  he helped pick gary barber, a south african-born producer of films such as ""ace ventura: pet detective"" as chief executive officer of the storied but debt-laden studio.  barber brought to the table a shrewd business sense, and connections into a world ulrich long admired from afar. barber shepherded mgm's development of ""the hobbit"" franchise, a co-production with warner bros. , that became a global smash hit.  he helmed the release of the james bond film, ""skyfall,"" which generated over $1 billion at the box office, and he revived the studio's work in television.  barber also brokered a deal to bring on tv super producer mark burnett, which gave mgm access to reality show hits like ""survivor"" and ""the apprentice,"" but would ultimately become personally troublesome. in 2012 the company bought back icahn's stock for $590 million.  it also filed paperwork for a possible public offering of shares, and considered other options, such as a sale. as barber boosted mgm's film and tv pipeline, ulrich was increasingly entranced by the allure of hollywood.  he became a regular at movie premieres in los angeles and new york, and frequented industry parties in the hamptons and elsewhere.  he became active in creative decisions after becoming chair of mgm's board -- somewhat unusual for a non-executive lacking hollywood experience -- even getting involved with business granularities like casting. growing riftbut over the following years a rift began to open up between barber and ulrich.  when it was time to renew barber's contract in 2017, ulrich conducted an extensive search for a new ceo.  when it ended, he ultimately chose to sign barber to a new five-year deal.  yet around the same time, the pair split on whether to sell the company, with ulrich wanting to hang on to the studio and barber saying it was time to find a buyer. the company would hold buyout talks with apple inc.  as well as chinese investors that would ultimately prove fruitless. only months after renewing barber's deal, ulrich fired him.  the shock departure meant the company had to pay barber for five years of salary and buy out his equity, a package totaling $260 million.  in the three years since barber left, ulrich hasn't replaced him, instead operating an ""office of the chief executive officer,"" comprised of various people that each have their personal vision for mgm. barber declined to comment via his spokesperson. bounce backafter the initial period of success following the restructuring, the gains became harder to come by, as they did in anchorage's overall credit-focused business.  two senior managers left the firm in january 2020, and another in november.  anchorage's flagship strategy, with about $8. 5 billion under management, returned just 0. 6% in 2018, 1. 5% in 2019 and 4. 4% in 2020, according to people familiar with the matter. in december, mgm hired investment bankers for a potential sale. mgm only released one film in theaters in 2020.  its biggest potential hit, the latest bond film, ""no time to die,"" was pushed from last year to this october as a result of the pandemic. yet the value of mgm's library rose as everyone from media companies to technology giants have sought to build video streaming platforms that can compete with industry leader netflix inc.  earnings jumped 48% last year, to about $307 million, even as sales declined. anchorage holds a roughly 30% stake in mgm, worth about $2. 5 billion in the sale, said people with knowledge of the matter.  anchorage invested around $500 million in the company more than a decade ago.  including the mgm stake, anchorage's flagship fund is up 18% this year, the people added.  the fund has gained about 8% in 2021 not counting the studio. more stories like this are available on bloomberg. comsubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source. ©2021 bloomberg l. p. ,.   !the draft rules, which will be open for public comment until june 1, could set a precedent for other bitcoin mining hubs in china. (bloomberg) -- china is taking another step to shape up state firms with a new fund aimed at reforming a sector that has emerged as the nation's biggest source of credit risk. china reform holdings corp. , a state-run investment firm, and a group of local state asset regulators have launched a suite of equity investment funds totaling 70 billion yuan ($11 billion) to help improve state-owned enterprises' corporate governance and turn them more market oriented, the company said in a statement thursday. the announcement marks the latest move by beijing to make the country's cumbersome and inefficient soes, especially those at the local level, more commercially viable and financially healthier.  a wave of bond defaults by state-linked firms since late last year and the ongoing debt saga at china huarong asset management co. , a top bad-loan manager, have challenged long-held assumptions of government support for such firms. the first batch of the newly established funds will total 35 billion yuan, which will be deployed in six cities including shanghai, shenzhen, shenyang, hangzhou, xi'an, and qingdao, said the statement, without offering further details about the specific uses of the funding. china's state asset regulator, including its local branches, oversees the vast majority of the nation's soes, except for financial firms including banks and bad-loan managers such as huarong that are overseen by financial regulators. china's state-linked borrowers, which have more than $4 trillion in outstanding onshore bonds, are facing increased scrutiny.  including its silence over huarong's debt woes, beijing is sending a clear signal that poorly run soes won't be automatically bailed out as president xi jinping seeks to reduce moral hazard in the country's financial markets. deepening concern about the level of backing for state firms at the local level has in part caused new debt sales to plunge in financially weaker provinces such as henan and shanxi this year. more stories like this are available on bloomberg. comsubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source. ©2021 bloomberg l. p. (bloomberg) -- china is clamping down on some corn imports amid concern that overseas purchases have spiraled out of control, prompting several feed mills to cancel their u. s.  cargoes. chinese customs authorities are restricting imports into free trade zones, which aren't counted toward an official annual purchase quota, according to people with knowledge of the matter.  total u. s.  corn cancellations are estimated to be less than 1 million tons, said two of the people, who asked not to be identified as the matter is private. the increased scrutiny by beijing over its corn imports comes as the broader market focuses on whether the country will continue its heightened purchases of raw materials from grains to metals to fossil fuels.  prices across a variety of products have soared this year partly because of chinese demand, raising import costs and sparking fears over inflation in the asian nation. corn futures in chicago fell as much as 2% before erasing losses as traders determined the scrapped purchases aren't big enough to alter an already tight supply situation.  some market watchers claim china, which is forecast to import a record amount of corn this year, is trying to get a better deal after prices recently surged above $7 a bushel for the first time since 2013. ""china is playing a negotiating game,"" said david martin, founder of martin fund management in new york. china's crackdown on corn purchases is targeted at businesses that have set up blending facilities in the free trade zones, according to the people familiar with the matter.  these facilities allow firms to mix the imported corn with other raw materials to produce livestock feed that enable them to profit from zero-tariff imports, the people said. calls to chinese customs outside business hours went unanswered. illinois corn farmer matt bennett, a co-founder of commodities brokerage and consulting firm agmarket. net, noted that china has a pattern of crop-import cancellations only to start ""buying the daylights out of stuff. ""the canceled shipments are a small amount compared to more than 20 million tons of american corn that china has purchased this season.  the asian nation has been a key source of demand for the grain to feed its recovering hog herd, helping to push prices to multiyear highs.  imports from the u. s.  have soared as beijing also seeks to fulfill its commitments for the ""phase one"" trade deal signed with the u. s.  in january 2020. the latest move by china ""is likely to have only a very small impact on china's compliance with the overall purchase commitments on the phase one agreement,"" said chad bown, an expert at the pro-trade peterson institute for international economics in washington.  ""corn is just too small a portion of the overall deal. ""corn quotaschina allocates annual corn import quotas to state and private firms.  state-owned cofco corp.  may at times receive an allowance to buy an additional amount that it resells domestically to private mills or to replenish state reserves. the quotas for 2021 are set at 7. 2 million tons.  imports outside the quota are possible, but may incur tariffs of up to 65% of the purchase price.  shipments into bonded zones are exempt from duties. the proliferation of businesses that are shipping corn into bonded zones and blending them for animal feed has alarmed authorities, who are seeking to control imports and maintain the quality of feed products. last month, shandong province shut down a feed producer located at a local bonded zone after its product was found to have fallen short of protein requirements.  the plant mainly blended corn with a low amount of distillers dried grains, or ddgs, said one of the people. all the cancellations will be of old u. s.  corn crop from the 2020-21 marketing year, the people said.  more than 15 million tons of american corn have been purchased for state stockpiles from old and new crops, two of the people said.

2021-05-28,Australia's Covid success under threat as Melbourne goes into lockdown.,"five million weary melbourne residents were put back under lockdown on friday, straining local resolve and testing australia's ""zero-covid"" strategy of smothering outbreaks however small. as authorities said a cluster of positive cases had grown to 39, streets in australia's second city emptied out for the fourth time since the pandemic began. ""it's just very difficult,"" resident gavin catt told afp.  ""this lockdown is affecting us.  many families and friends can't work. ""melbournians have been ordered to stay at home for seven days to stall transmission and buy the authorities time to investigate how the virus again jumped from hotel quarantine into the community. the outbreak is believed to have begun when a traveller infected with the indian variant returned to australia, but victoria's acting state premier james merlino called for military help with the investigation. around 15,000 close contacts have been identified and the list of venues visited by confirmed cases had grown to 130. merlino on thursday blamed sluggish vaccine rollout and hotel quarantine failures for the latest outbreak. ""if we had an alternative to hotel quarantine for this particular variant of concern, we would not be here today,"" he said. it is believed to be the 17th time in six months that the virus has leaked out of makeshift hotel quarantine facilities, which are now facing tough scrutiny. fingers are also being pointed at australia's conservative federal government for the slow rate of vaccinations, which threatens to reverse the country's early virus success. australia has recorded 30,000 covid-19 cases since the pandemic began -- with a large portion in hotel quarantine -- in a country of 25 million people. but only two percent of australians have so far been fully vaccinated. ""i'm from new york originally so i feel like we've had a really good go of it here in australia in terms of how many people have gotten sick,"" said david gonzalez. ""so i guess i'm willing to accept a bit of a slow rollout but if these things happen more often, they just have to get more vaccines in the country. ""prime minister scott morrison has defended his government's handling of the crisis saying hotel quarantine facilities were ""99. 99 percent effective. ""but critics countered that a single infection leaking from a quarantine system that has processed thousands of travellers was sufficient to shut down an entire state, and the country's second-biggest city. in recent months, australians had largely been enjoying few restrictions after the country successfully contained the spread of coronavirus. but outbreaks in taiwan and japan have underscored how initial success containing the virus can quickly be eroded without widespread vaccination. australia is currently vaccinating around 75,000 people each day. in a note to clients on friday, the national australian bank warned that it is ""clear that virus outbreaks from hotel quarantine remain a significant risk for australia until a high degree of vaccine penetration is reached"". ""on the current pace, australia will not reach a level of vaccination approaching herd immunity (estimates suggest that is around 70% or higher) by the end of the year.

""will the bank call the loans? will suppliers continue to offer credit terms?"" he said on his facebook page.  noting the statement was issued by the board, leung questioned why it had not made its own assessment during the trading suspension, rather than relying on the management's.  ex-hong kong leader has government on the defensive.  is he planning a comeback? ""who is the person in charge of the management? this is the chief executive officer.  and who is the chief executive officer? he is cheung kim-hung,"" he wrote.  the former leader – who is also a vice-chairman of china's top political advisory body – had already lashed out at cheung before next digital's announcement, revealing on wednesday that he had appointed a lawyer to file a formal complaint with law enforcement against the ceo for making ""negligent, irresponsible and intentionally misleading"" remarks.  leung disputed cheung's suggestion the company's operations and finances would not be affected by the freezing of lai's assets, and demanded a thorough investigation by authorities.  asked about the criticisms, cheung declined to comment.  additional reporting by jeffie lammore from south china morning post:hong kong authorities freeze nearly hk$500 million in assets belonging to media tycoon jimmy laifuture of hong kong's apple daily is on the line after founder jimmy lai's assets are frozen under national security lawthis article national security law: jimmy lai's hong kong bankers warned that handling assets could land them in jail first appeared on south china morning postfor the latest news from the south china morning post download our mobile app.  copyright 2021. the trial of an australian academic detained for more than two years in china on espionage charges began behind closed doors on thursday, with canberra voicing deep concerns over a lack of transparency after its ambassador was denied access. laliga santander's official 2020-21 season awards have rewarded three stand-out individual performances and achievements.

2021-05-28,"Tokyo Games could lead to 'Olympic' COVID-19 strain, Japanese doctor warns.","tokyo: the head of a japanese doctors' union warned on thursday (may 25) that holding the olympic games in tokyo this summer, with tens of thousands of people from around the world, could lead to the emergence of an ""olympic"" strain of the coronavirus. japan has pledged to hold a ""safe and secure"" 2020 olympics in tokyo after a year-long postponement but it is struggling to contain a fourth wave of infections and preparing to extend a state of emergency in much of the country. japanese officials, olympics organisers and the international olympic committee (ioc) have allvowed the games will go ahead, albeit under strict virus-prevention measures.  foreign spectators have been banned and a decision on domestic ones is expected next month. but even with those steps, worries remain about the influx of athletes and officials into japan, where a vaccination drive remains glacially slow, with just over 5 per cent of the population having had a shot. with people from more than 200 nations and territories set to arrive, the games, due to begin in eight weeks, pose a danger, said naoto ueyama, head of the japan doctors union. ""all of the different mutant strains of the virus which exist in different places will be concentrated and gathering here in tokyo.  we cannot deny the possibility of even a new strain of the virus potentially emerging,"" he told a news conference. ""if such a situation were to arise, it could even mean a tokyo olympic strain of the virus being named in this way, which would be a huge tragedy and something which would be the target of criticism, even for 100 years. ""but kenji shibuya, director of the institute of population health at king's college, london, who has recently been helping the vaccination campaign in japan, played down dangers specific to the games. ""mutation takes place when virus stays in immunocompromised or partially immunised people for a long period of time,"" shibuya said. ""so the current situation in japan is more dangerous than (during) the tokyo games, in my opinion. ""state of emergencythe asahi shimbun, an official partner of the tokyo olympics, carried an editorial on wednesdayurging the games be cancelled, but former ioc vice president dick pound said later in the day the sports extravaganza should and would go ahead. the government is currently preparing to extend a state of emergency across much of the nation originally set to be lifted on may 31, most likely well into june, officials have said just weeks before the games are set to open on jul 23. but ioc member john coates has said the olympics could be held even under a state of emergency, an opinion ueyama said was infuriating. ""in regards to these statements, the people of japan are indeed holding great anger towards this, and this is even more the case for healthcare and medical professionals,"" ueyama said. earlier this week, theunited states advised against travel to japan, but olympics organisers have said this will not affect the games.  the white house on wednesday said it had been assured by japan's government that it will keep in close contact about concerns over the olympics. in a sign of how uncertain the situation remains, however, australia's major sports leagues and olympic hopefuls were left scrambling to make contingency plans after authorities announced a seven-day lockdown in the southern state of victoria to contain a covid-19 outbreak in melbourne. chiba prefecture, which borders tokyo, announced on thursday that it was cancelling its stretch of the olympic torch relay out of safety concerns, becoming the latest area to scale back events. downloadour appor subscribe to our telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:https://cna. asia/telegramit looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-05-28,"Covid-19: Why S'pore is in a stronger position than it was last year, Health News & Top Stories.","read 3 articles daily and stand to win st rewards, including the st news tablet worth $398. spin the wheel for st read and win now. singapore a fresh wave of covid-19 infections is sweeping the globe, with several countries in the region, including malaysia, indonesia and the philippines getting badly hit. singapore has not been spared. in the fortnight till may 26, it has seen between 19 and 38 new community cases diagnosed each day compared with the one to 16 cases a day in the previous fortnight in spite of tighter safety measures. to some, this evokes memories of the days leading up to the circuit breaker last year, when case numbers were rising. but there are key differences.  singapore may be battling more infectious variants of the virus this time around, but it appears to have a firmer grip on the situation. the number of new community cases is currently lower than the roughly 40-60 in early april last year, just before the circuit breaker was implemented. this is despite the fact that all four of the more easily transmissible variants of concern (vocs) have been found here, with several of the recent clusters caused by the spread of the b1617 variant that is ravaging india. there are about 240 people requiring hospital care today, among whom 18 are on oxygen and two need intensive care. but singapore has so far evaded the fate of countries that faced second waves of infection far more devastating than the first. globally, there are more new daily cases this year than last more than half a million people are infected each day largely due to the high rate of transmission in india.  places like brazil and argentina continue to report high numbers. professor leo yee sin, executive director of the national centre for infectious diseases, said: ""the strain that is prevalent in many of the covid-19 cases (in singapore) in recent weeks is the b16172 variant. ""this has a ""higher amount of virus excreted from respiratory secretion compared with the parent strain"", she added, and ""can amplify in all forms of transmission routes"", such as surfaces, through direct contact, droplet and aerosol transmission. yet experts the straits times spoke to were generally optimistic. dr asok kurup, who chairs the academy of medicine's chapter of infectious disease physicians, said: ""i was initially all for a circuit breaker, but it seems that the daily numbers are pretty stable and manageable. ""professor dale fisher, a senior infectious diseases consultant at the national university hospital (nuh), said: ""the curve is quite flat and, importantly, what we aren't seeing is exponential growth. ""prof fisher said singapore can also take comfort that a third of the population has had at least one dose of the vaccine. he said singapore is ""starting to reap the benefits"" of lower transmissions, since people who have been vaccinated, even with just one dose, are less likely to spread the virus.  and should they get infected, the disease is less severe for them. the hospitals have not been overwhelmed and have been able to cope. prof fisher said that while the mrna vaccines may be less effective against the vocs, the drop in efficacy is only about 5-10 per cent which means ""they are still really good"". associate professor hsu liyang of the nus saw swee hock school of public health feels singapore is in a stronger position than it was last year. ""today, we understand far more about the virus than we did before. . .  we know how to limit its spread and have treatment options backed by clinical trials.  we have safe and effective vaccines. . .  and the capacity to ramp up testing and containment facilities,"" he said. his colleague at the school, associate professor alex cook, fully agreed: ""we hold a strong hand. ""the safe management measures to control spread are generally very effective, adherence is good, testing capacity is high, vaccination roll-out is proceeding apace, the border has been made even more secure. ""he said the major risk is the ""seemingly more transmissible variants"", which is why the safety measures ""are not quite as effective as they were last year"". prof cook added that since the immunity levels among migrant workers is much higher today, ""we are much less likely to see the explosive dorm outbreaks we did a year ago"". last year, covid-19 spread like wildfire among dormitory residents, shooting up very quickly to hit more than 1,000 cases a day by mid-april, putting great stress on the healthcare system. cases in the dormitories still account for more than 90 per cent of all local cases.  singapore also has about 4,600 imported cases, bringing the total number here to close to 62,000. but there have been only a handful of cases among dormitory residents in the past fortnight. and yet, it could be a long time before life returns to normal. countries around the world have been hoping to acquire herd immunity through a population vaccination programme as the answer to the pandemic. the idea is that those who are vaccinated would break the chain of transmission, hence reducing the spread of the disease. the number touted for herd immunity has gone up from getting 50 per cent of the population vaccinated when the pandemic was declared, to 60- 80 per cent today. herd immunity depends on a number of factors. the r0, or transmission rate, is of course important.  at the start of the pandemic, one person was thought to be transmitting the disease to two others so if half the population was immune, the spread would fall to one person infecting just one other.  in other words, the number of infections would remain flat. but the vocs are said to be more easily transmitted.  this means that a larger proportion of the population needs to be immune to spreading the virus. then, the level of protection given by the vaccine, or prior infection, also influences the transmission rate.  the lower the protection rate, the higher the percentage of population that has to be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity. ""i am not sure that herd immunity is a useful concept here,"" said prof fisher.  ""the endpoint will be ongoing transmission where only the unvaccinated get sick. ""   so 'herd immunity' will not protect people who do not have immunity either from a previous infection or through vaccination. even with herd immunity, people will get infected, though the country will not see an explosion of cases. professor ooi eng eong, of the duke-nus medical school's emerging infectious diseases programme, said: ""i don't think we will get rid of covid-19, but the number of cases would not overwhelm our healthcare system to result in excessive number of covid-19-related deaths. ""but he is optimistic that vaccines will restore most of what life was before 2020, though he added: ""we will, however, have to develop an active surveillance system for covid-19 cases even when vaccinated, to be proactive in dealing with potential vaccine-escape mutants if they do arise. ""prof fisher agreed that once people here are vaccinated, covid-19 can be treated as a mild disease.  this could even happen by the end of this year, he said. ""that's what the vaccine does reduces transmission and makes the disease mild.  we could remove quarantine as an entry requirement to singapore but it does require a very high vaccine uptake here. ""quarantine may still be required for visitors coming from places with high infection rates. however, dr kurup said: ""no i don't see this yet as we have not even climbed the peak. ""he said travel will only be possible when large numbers of people everywhere get vaccinated, and this is difficult to achieve with inequitable access. prof cook too said that carefree travel may be some way off, given the delays in getting vaccines to low- and middle-income countries. ""but opportunities for some forms of travel may become more possible once vaccination rates have expanded sufficiently. ""so while everyone here might chafe at the current restrictions on movement and socialising, there appears to be a light at the end of tunnel for those who are vaccinated. unfortunately, some people, because of their age or medical conditions, cannot be vaccinated at least with the current vaccines available. prof leo said while vaccination and contact tracing are important tools to prevent or slow down transmission, it is more important that people follow safety measures and see a doctor when sick, since the virus ""is elusive in nature"". rigorous precautions by everyone may be the only way to keep it in check. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

not been spared.', 'in the fortnight till may 26, it has seen between 19 and 38 new community cases diagnosed each day compared with the one to 16 cases a day in the previous fortnight in spite of tighter safety measures.', 'to some, this evokes memories of the days leading up to the circuit breaker last year, when case numbers were rising.', 'but there are key differences.', 'singapore may be battling more infectious variants of the virus this time around, but it appears to have a firmer grip on the situation.', 'the number of new community cases is currently lower than the roughly 40-60 in early april last year, just before the circuit breaker was implemented.', 'this is despite the fact that all four of the more easily transmissible variants of concern (vocs) have been found here, with several of the recent clusters caused by the spread of the b1617 variant that is ravaging india.', 'there are about 240 people requiring hospital care today, among whom 18 are on oxygen and two need intensive care.', 'but singapore has so far evaded the fate of countries that faced second waves of infection far more devastating than the first.', 'globally, there are more new daily cases this year than last more than half a million people are infected each day largely due to the high rate of transmission in india.', 'places like brazil and argentina continue to report high numbers.', 'professor leo yee sin, executive director of the national centre for infectious diseases, said: ""the strain that is prevalent in many of the covid-19 cases (in singapore) in recent weeks is the b16172 variant.', '""this has a ""higher amount of virus excreted from respiratory secretion compared with the parent strain"", she added, and ""can amplify in all forms of transmission routes"", such as surfaces, through direct contact, droplet and aerosol transmission.', 'yet experts the straits times spoke to were generally optimistic.', 'dr asok kurup, who chairs the academy of medicine\'s chapter of infectious disease physicians, said: ""i was initially all for a circuit breaker, but it seems that the daily numbers are pretty stable and manageable.', '""professor dale fisher, a senior infectious diseases consultant at the national university hospital (nuh), said: ""the curve is quite flat and, importantly, what we aren\'t seeing is exponential growth.', '""prof fisher said singapore can also take comfort that a third of the population has had at least one dose of the vaccine.', 'he said singapore is ""starting to reap the benefits"" of lower transmissions, since people who have been vaccinated, even with just one dose, are less likely to spread the virus.', 'and should they get infected, the disease is less severe for them.', 'the hospitals have not been overwhelmed and have been able to cope.', 'prof fisher said that while the mrna vaccines may be less effective against the vocs, the drop in efficacy is only about 5-10 per cent which means ""they are still really good"".', 'associate professor hsu liyang of the nus saw swee hock school of public health feels singapore is in a stronger position than it was last year.', '""today, we understand far more about the virus than we did before.', '.', '.', 'we know how to limit its spread and have treatment options backed by clinical trials.', 'we have safe and effective vaccines.', '.', '.', 'and the capacity to ramp up testing and containment facilities,"" he said.', 'his colleague at the school, associate professor alex cook, fully agreed: ""we hold a strong hand.', '""the safe management measures to control spread are generally very effective, adherence is good, testing capacity is high, vaccination roll-out is proceeding apace, the border has been made even more secure.', '""he said the major risk is the ""seemingly more transmissible variants"", which is why the safety measures ""are not quite as effective as they were last year"".', 'prof cook added that since the immunity levels among migrant workers is much higher today, ""we are much less likely to see the explosive dorm outbreaks we did a year ago"".', 'last year, covid-19 spread like wildfire among dormitory residents, shooting up very quickly to hit more than 1,000 cases a day by mid-april, putting great stress on the healthcare system.', 'cases in the dormitories still account for more than 90 per cent of all local cases.', 'singapore also has about 4,600 imported cases, bringing the total number here to close to 62,000. but there have been only a handful of cases among dormitory residents in the past fortnight.', 'and yet, it could be a long time before life returns to normal.', 'countries around the world have been hoping to acquire herd immunity through a population vaccination programme as the answer to the pandemic.', 'the idea is that those who are vaccinated would break the chain of transmission, hence reducing the spread of the disease.', 'the number touted for herd immunity has gone up from getting 50 per cent of the population vaccinated when the pandemic was declared, to 60- 80 per cent today.', 'herd immunity depends on a number of factors.', 'the r0, or transmission rate, is of course important.', 'at the start of the pandemic, one person was thought to be transmitting the disease to two others so if half the population was immune, the spread would fall to one person infecting just one other.', 'in other words, the number of infections would remain flat.', 'but the vocs are said to be more easily transmitted.', 'this means that a larger proportion of the population needs to be immune to spreading the virus.', 'then, the level of protection given by the vaccine, or prior infection, also influences the transmission rate.', 'the lower the protection rate, the higher the percentage of population that has to be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity.', '""i am not sure that herd immunity is a useful concept here,"" said prof fisher.', '""the endpoint will be ongoing transmission where only the unvaccinated get sick. ""', ""so 'herd immunity' will not protect people who do not have immunity either from a previous infection or through vaccination."", 'even with herd immunity, people will get infected, though the country will not see an explosion of cases.', 'professor ooi eng eong, of the duke-nus medical school\'s emerging infectious diseases programme, said: ""i don\'t think we will get rid of covid-19, but the number of cases would not overwhelm our healthcare system to result in excessive number of covid-19-related deaths.', '""but he is optimistic that vaccines will restore most of what life was before 2020, though he added: ""we will, however, have to develop an active surveillance system for covid-19 cases even when vaccinated, to be proactive in dealing with potential vaccine-escape mutants if they do arise.', '""prof fisher agreed that once people here are vaccinated, covid-19 can be treated as a mild disease.', 'this could even happen by the end of this year, he said.', '""that\'s what the vaccine does reduces transmission and makes the disease mild.', 'we could remove quarantine as an entry requirement to singapore but it does require a very high vaccine uptake here.', '""quarantine may still be required for visitors coming from places with high infection rates.', 'however, dr kurup said: ""no i don\'t see this yet as we have not even climbed the peak.', '""he said travel will only be possible when large numbers of people everywhere get vaccinated, and this is difficult to achieve with inequitable access.', 'prof cook too said that carefree travel may be some way off, given the delays in getting vaccines to low- and middle-income countries.', '""but opportunities for some forms of travel may become more possible once vaccination rates have expanded sufficiently.', '""so while everyone here might chafe at the current restrictions on movement and socialising, there appears to be a light at the end of tunnel for those who are vaccinated.', 'unfortunately, some people, because of their age or medical conditions, cannot be vaccinated at least with the current vaccines available.', 'prof leo said while vaccination and contact tracing are important tools to prevent or slow down transmission, it is more important that people follow safety measures and see a doctor when sick, since the virus ""is elusive in nature"".', 'rigorous precautions by everyone may be the only way to keep it in check.', ""join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you."", 'sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.', 'no.', '198402868e.', 'all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.', 'until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.', 'but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.']",data/2021-5-28.csv,"Myanmar junta moves civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, ex-president Win Myint to 'unknown location', SE Asia News & Top Stories."

""i didn't believe it . . .  but then they called me again using a number that, when i googled, showed that it was from a beijing police department,"" he said. ""they video-called me wearing police attire and their background looked like a police station,"" sam told reporters on may 23 (sunday). the men then told sam that he owed s$10,000, reassuring him that they would investigate and help get his money back. they kept in touch with sam through phone calls and whatsapp messages, occasionally video-calling him. ""gradually, i started believing them,"" said sam. then things suddenly took a dramatic turn. the same men allegedly told sam that he was involved in a serious financial crime by a syndicate.  they told him to cut off contact with his family and friends, and live somewhere else for a few days while they investigated, he added. sam left his house and checked into a hotel along upper serangoon road after receiving a parcel containing s$500, a mobile phone and a hotel key card.  the scammers then told him to pose in front of a video call while gagged and blindfolded. this was for an ""x-ray"" photo that would be used for comparison with ""investigation findings"" in china, the scammers had allegedly said. by this time his parents, who are based in china, felt like something was wrong. ""we couldn't contact him on may 15 and thought that he should be back the next day,"" sam's father told reporters in the same interview. when sam did not return home on may 16, they filed a missing person report with the singapore police force (spf). unaware of the missing person's report, sam moved out of the hotel and into a housing board flat in clementi a few days later under the instructions of the men who called him. there, he met three people  a 61-year-old man, his wife and their tenant. ""the first time i met him, (the 61-year-old man) asked me whether i was sent here by chinese police officers,"" said sam.  ""and so, i believed him,"" he added. sam said he spent his time watching tv shows, ordering food and sometimes, even playing cards with the man's wife. sam's father said that they were mentally preparing themselves for a few outcomes – ""an accident, a scam or a kidnap"". on may 20 at around 7am, sam's parents received a call with the video of sam blindfolded and gagged.  the sender demanded his parents pay six million yuan (about s$1. 24 million) in ransom. the video message, seen by cna, carried an audio message.  a man's voice could be heard, saying in mandarin, ""kid, don't be scared, i won't hurt you.  listen up, as long as your parents pay up you don't have to worry about anything else.  eventually, we will release you, but this is also up to your parents. """"now we know it is fake, but . . .  it was scary,"" said sam's father, adding that he contacted spf and the chinese consulate in singapore. police conducted investigations and eventually found sam a few hours later.  they explained to him that he had been a victim of a scam. two men involved in scam suspected to be victims themselvesthe police arrested the 33-year-old man, who had handed the phone and money to sam, for his alleged involvement in the china official impersonation scam, said spf in a news release on wednesday. the owner of the hdb flat, the 61-year-old man, is currently under investigation. preliminary investigations revealed that the two men, who are unrelated to each other, may also have been victims of a scam, said the police. the 33-year-old man had allegedly received s$1,000 from scammers to help stage sam's ""disappearance"".  he bought the mobile phone and sim card for the victim's communication with the scammer and booked the hotel room.  these were all allegedly done on the scammer's instructions, said the police. meanwhile, the 61-year-old man was also believed to have been tricked into thinking that he was housing an important witness for a police investigation. anyone found guilty of cheating could be jailed up to 10 years and fined. those found guilty of the offence of money laundering could be jailed up to 10 years, fined up to s$500,000, or both. last year, a total of 443 cases of china official impersonation scams were reported, with victimscheated of more than s$39 million.  it marked a small decrease from 2019, which saw 456 such cases reported.

""in osaka and tokyo, the flow of people is starting to creep up, and there are concerns that infections will rise,"" economy minister yasutoshi nishimura, who also heads the country's coronavirus countermeasures, said at the start of a meeting with experts. the experts later approved the government proposal and prime minister yoshihide suga officially announced the extensions. worries about variants of the novel coronavirus and a slow vaccination drive have prompted urgent calls from doctors, some high-profile business executives, and hundreds of thousands of citizens to cancel the olympic games, due to start on july 23. japanese officials, olympics organisers and the international olympic committee (ioc) have said the games would go ahead under strict virus-prevention measures.  ioc's senior official john coates, who oversees the preparations, said last week the games were on whether or not the host city, tokyo, is under a state of emergency at the time. tokyo 2020 organising committee president seiko hashimoto told a news conference she had received pledges from india – now battling a deadly second covid-19 wave – and five other countries to vaccinate all their olympic delegates as a measure against a new variant that has emerged in india. ioc president thomas bach has said 80 per cent of the 10,500 athletes expected in japan would be vaccinated and on thursday urged olympians to get their shots if they could.  delegates must also be tested before and after arrival. comments by ioc officials appearing to dismiss japanese concerns have sparked outrage on social media, including ioc's bach telling an international athletes forum on thursday: ""come with full confidence to tokyo and get ready"", calling tokyo the ""best prepared olympic city ever"". ""i want to say 'shut up',"" said one twitter user.  ""let's beat up on the ioc, which denigrates japan, and halt these crazy olympics. ""japan has recorded about 727,000 coronavirus infections and 12,597 deaths so far.  about 6 per cent of its population has been vaccinated, according to reuters data, the lowest among the world's larger, rich countries. under the government's current plan, about 30 per cent of the population would be vaccinated by the end of july, mr nishimura said. after meeting with japanese officials on thursday, european commission president ursula von der leyen backed tokyo's hosting of the olympics and said the european union had authorised the export to japan of more than 100 million vaccine doses, enough to inoculate about 40 per cent of the population. international spectators will not be allowed for the games but some 90,000 people including athletes and their delegations will be coming.  no decision has been made yet on domestic fans and tokyo 2020's mr hashimoto said the situation regarding the state of emergency would need to be taken into account. polls show a majority of japanese want the games, postponed last year due to covid-19, either cancelled or put off again. that is a worry for mr suga, whose support has slid over his handling of the response to covid-19 and who faces a general election and a ruling party leadership race later this year. but cancellation would carry its own political risk for the premier, some ruling party lawmakers said. ""the demerits would outweigh the merits,"" liberal democratic party mp hajime funada said.  ""it would give the impression that japan is in such dire straits it cannot hold the games. ""japan's latest emergency steps, unlike stricter measures in many countries, have focused mainly on asking eateries that serve alcohol to close and those that don't to shut down by 8pm. nomura research institute executive economist takahide kiuchi said an extension of the states of emergency would mean the economy would likely contract in the current quarter, pushing it back into a recession. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-05-28,Myanmar military tribunal orders 20-year jail terms for torching Chinese-linked factories: Report.,"yangon: a myanmar military tribunal has sentenced 28 people to 20 years in jail with hard labour for arson attacks on two factories, state media reported, after a string of mainly chinese-financed factories were torched during unrest in yangon in march. the army-run myawady news portal said the offenders had targeted a shoe plant and a garment factory in the industrial hlaing tharyar suburb of myanmar's biggest city. martial law was imposed in the suburb after the blazes, with dozens killed or wounded when security forces opened fire on anti-military protesters, media and an activist group said. the chinese embassy in myanmar said at the time that many chinese staff were injured and trapped in the arson attacks and called on myanmar to protect chinese property and citizens. a total of 32 chinese-invested factories were vandalised in the attacks, with property losses reaching 240 million yuan (us$36. 9 million), china's state-controlled tabloid global times said in march. china is viewed as being supportive of the military junta that overthrew the elected government of aung san suu kyi on feb 1. no group claimed responsibility for burning the factories. myanmar has been in chaos since the army took power and arrested aung san suu kyi and other members or her party, with daily protests, marches and strikes against the junta. security forces have responded with lethal force, killing more than 800 people, according to the assistance association for political prisoners activist group.  the military disputes this figure and coup leader min aung hlaing recently said about 300 people had been killed in the unrest, including 47 police. as well as renewed conflict with ethnic forces in border areas, fighting has also escalated between myanmar's army and often rag-tag militias opposed to the military in some regions. in eastern myanmar near the border of shan and kayah states, dozens of security forces and local fighters have been killed in recent fighting, according to residents and media reports. a resident taking refuge near the town of demoso reported on friday (may 28) that power was down and fighting had flared on thursday night with the constant thud of artillery.

2021-05-28,Police warn of loan scam involving fake letters or emails from banks and government agencies.,"singapore: the police have observed a new variant of loan scams that involved fake letters or emails from banks or government agencies, requiring that victims pay an administrative fee before receiving their loan. at least 20 reports were received between january and april this year, with losses amounting to more than s$200,000, the authorities said in a news release on wednesday (may 26). in these cases, victims would receive unsolicited text messages or come across websites or advertisements offering loans. victims who replied with the intention to take up a loan would be redirected to whatsapp to communicate their loan application.  scammers would then request for the victims' personal particulars so the loan application could be processed. subsequently, the scammers would inform the victims that the loan had been approved before asking them to make payments of varying amounts as collateral, processing or transfer fees. according to police, the scammers would present fake letters or emails they said were from banks or government agencies, such as the monetary authority of singapore or the state courts, which could indicate that the payments were required under specific regulations before the loan could be disbursed. victims would only realise they had been scammed when they did not receive the loan, police added. the authorities reminded the public that licensed moneylenders are not allowed to solicit for loans via text messages, phone calls or social media platforms. these moneylenders are also required to meet the borrower in person at the approved place of business to conduct physical face-to-face verification of identity before granting any loan.  loan transactions are not allowed to be performed fully online. licensed moneylenders will also not ask an applicant to make payments for the secure disbursement of the loan, including gst, ""admin fees"" and ""processing fees"".  processing fees or tax payments to a government agency are similarly not required. the business address of each licensed moneylender is published on thelaw ministry's website. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-05-28,Hong Kong tycoons offer US$1 million flat to lottery to boost COVID-19 vaccine take-up rate.,"hong kong: hong kong residents reluctant to get the coronavirus jab have been given a million-dollar reason to roll up their sleeves after property tycoons donated a brand new flat to a vaccine lottery. worth hk$10. 8 million (us$1. 4 million), the one-bedroom apartment will be the lucky draw's grand prize, the property developers announced on friday (may 28). they will also offer 20 other prizes worth hk$100,000 each. hong kong is one of the few places in the world to have secured more than enough doses to inoculate all 7. 5 million people. but rampant distrust of the government combined with a lack of urgency in a comparatively virus-free city has led to hesitancy and a dismally lagging inoculation drive. seeking to boost uptake, sino group, ng teng fong charitable foundation and chinese estates holdings said all hong kong residents aged 18 and above who have received both doses of a covid-19 vaccine will be eligible to register for the lucky draw until sep 1. only permanent residents are eligible for the top prize of an apartment in the world's most unaffordable housing market. ""we hope to increase hong kong's vaccination rate through the lucky draw,"" daryl ng, the director of the foundation said in a statement. the groups said further details would be released at a later date. the announcement came three days after the city's chief executive carrie lam rejected calls for the government to offer cash handouts to encourage inoculations.  she suggested local businesses provide the incentives. ""to offer cash or something physical to encourage vaccination shouldn't be done by the government,"" she said. vaccine lotteries have started catching on in the united states, with california, colorado, ohio, new york and oregon offering a chance to win costly prizes. a rural town in the philippines announced it will raffle off a cow to motivate people to get the jab. in hong kong, less than 20 per cent of the population has received the first vaccine dose, while just over 14 per cent has received two doses. hesitancy is common even among the city's medical workers.  earlier this month, the hospital authority revealed only one third of its staff had been vaccinated. on tuesday, the rollout was expanded to non-residents, with around 40,000 chinese mainlanders with travel permits as well as about 13,000 asylum-seekers now eligible for jabs. earlier this week, the hong kong airport authority announced its own giveaway of 60,000 free flights by the end of september to encourage the lagging vaccine rollout. hong kong's hesitancy comes as many neighbouring countries scramble to secure enough doses to combat spiralling coronavirus outbreaks. some hong kong politicians have suggested the city could look to send its unused doses overseas if take-up does not improve. downloadour appor subscribe to our telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:https://cna. asia/telegramit looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-05-28,"Govt announces $800m Covid-19 support package for workers and businesses, Singapore News.","singapore an $800 million support package that includes enhanced wage subsidies under the jobs support scheme (jss) and rental relief will be rolled out to help businesses and workers cope with the impact of tightened covid-19 restrictions. announcing the measures on friday (may 28), finance minister lawrence wong said affected gyms, fitness studios and performing arts and arts education centres will get 50 per cent of salary support for local employees under the jss. sectors that do not have to suspend operations but are significantly affected by the measures will get 30 per cent of jss subsidies. this will help retailers, personal care service providers, museums, art galleries, historical sites, cinemas, indoor playgrounds and other family entertainment centres. but supermarkets, convenience stores and online retailers will not be eligible for the enhanced wage support. the enhanced payouts, which are based on wages paid in april to june this year, will be disbursed in september, said the ministry of finance (mof) in a statement. employers who put local employees on mandatory no-pay leave or retrench them will not be eligible for jss payouts for those employees, the ministry added. [[nid:518982]]other businesses that wish to appeal for enhanced jss support can do so at this website. the various support measures for those affected by the phase two (heightened alert) restrictions from may 16 to june 13 will not require an additional draw on past reserves. instead, they will be funded through a reallocation of spending, as some development expenditure can be capitalised under the recently passed significant infrastructure government loan act (singa) bill, mof said. a supplementary supply bill will be tabled at the next parliament sitting in july to effect the reallocation of spending. speaking at a virtual press conference, mr wong said the tightened measures have also been helping to curb the spread of the virus. ""therefore, we do not think there is a need for further tightening in our overall posture,"" he said, adding that the multi-ministry task force on covid-19 will give a fuller update at a press conference on monday. if there are further extensions of the restrictions beyond june 13, mof will consider whether support measures can be similarly extended, he added. mr wong, who co-chairs the task force, said the financial support package handed out this time round is not on the same scale as those allocated last year. this is because most parts of the economy are still operating, and there are also more government schemes, like the jobs growth incentive, to support new jobs and opportunities. last year, close to $100 billion was dedicated to covid-19 support measures over five budgets, with up to $52 billion drawn from the reserves. [[nid:507545]]""our circumstances today are very different compared with last year.  and under such a circumstance, i don't think we should be going to the president to seek permission to draw on our past reserves"" said the minister, adding that singapore must expect to run into situations like this from time to time, when restrictions need to be tightened temporarily to control the spread of the virus.

2021-05-28,"US ‘Indo-Pacific strategy’, formation of cliques will lead to divisions, chaos: Chinese military.","china's military on thursday criticised the biden administration for continuing the trump era ""indo-pacific strategy"", saying the us should not form ""cliques"" or provoke ""new cold war"" featuring bloc confrontation. no strategy should instigate countries to establish selective and exclusive military alliances, to gang up or to create the ""new cold war"" featuring bloc confrontation, and the zero-sum game will only lead to more division, antagonism and chaos, senior colonel tan kefei, spokesperson for the chinese ministry of national defence, said at an online press conference. he made the remarks while responding to a question that us president joe biden has continued to promote the ""indo-pacific strategy"" formulated by his predecessor donald trump to deter china and made frequent military provocations against beijing. his comments also came a week after a us navy guided-missile destroyer sailed through the taiwan strait on may 19, challenging china's claims over the area as beijing claims taiwan as part of its mainland. the chinese navy, which rushed its ships to pursue the american warship, accused the us of resorting to provocative moves. the us navy's 7th fleet said in a statement ""the ship's transit through the taiwan strait demonstrates the us commitment to a free and open indo-pacific"". sr.  col.  tan did not directly refer to the quadrilateral alliance or quad comprising the us, india, australia and japan while accusing washington of forming cliques.  however, the chinese foreign ministry has in recent weeks stepped up attacks on the four-nation alliance, terming it as an exclusive clique portraying china as a challenge and sowing discord between beijing and regional countries. tan, while claiming that china always holds that no strategy should go against the historical trend of peace and development, or deliberately hype up conflict and confrontation, said that intensifying military presence and highlighting military competition will only aggravate regional tensions and endanger world peace and stability. ""no strategy should harm the welfare of people in regional countries, or put them in a dangerous situation.  seeking one's own selfish interests and unilateral absolute security will only do harm to others and lose their support,"" he was quoted as saying by the chinese military online. referring to the reported comments by a us defence department official that the us government intends to put in place more defence hotlines with china to manage security risks and prevent potential conflicts, the chinese defence ministry spokesperson said that for a long time, the chinese and american militaries have always maintained communication through multiple channels, including the direct line between the two defence ministries. ""we believe that its purpose is to enhance trust, reduce misgivings, manage crises, and prevent conflicts.  the us side should not, on the one hand, claim to put up new defence hotlines, while on the other hand keep ramping up military deployments in the asian pacific region, frequently conduct close-in reconnaissance on china, and even deliberately initiate dangerous circumstances where aircraft and vessels nearly collide, he said. he said that china advises the us side to keep their words and match their deeds accordingly, display sincerity, work with the chinese side toward the same goal, and push forward the healthy and stable development of mil-to-mil relations by intensifying dialogue and communication and properly managing divergences. china and the us are currently at loggerheads over a host of issues as the biden administration continued the tough policy to contain china initiated by trump, targeting beijing on xinjiang, hong kong and taiwan. biden beefed-up the us-china policy by uniting us allies like the uk, the eu and japan.  he also hosted the first quadrilateral summit of the emerging alliance called quad in march which included the us, australia, japan and india. 📣 the indian express is now on telegram.  click here to join our channel (@indianexpress) and stay updated with the latest headlinesfor all the latest world news, download indian express app.

2021-05-28,Biden’s Asia Czar Says Era of Engagement With China Is Over.,"get the daily fully briefed newsletter, straight to your inbox. (bloomberg) --the u. s.  is entering a period of intense competition with china as the government running the world's second-biggest economy becomes ever more tightly controlled by president xi jinping, the white house's top official for asia said. ""the period that was broadly described as engagement has come to an end,"" kurt campbell, the u. s.  coordinator for indo-pacific affairs on the national security council, said wednesday at an event hosted by stanford university.  u. s.  policy toward china will now operate under a ""new set of strategic parameters,"" campbell said, adding that ""the dominant paradigm is going to be competition. ""chinese policies under xi are in large part responsible for the shift in u. s.  policy, campbell said, citing military clashes on china's border with india, an ""economic campaign"" against australia and the rise of ""wolf warrior"" diplomacy.  beijing's behavior was emblematic of a shift toward ""harsh power, or hard power,"" which ""signals that china is determined to play a more assertive role,"" he said. the blunt comments were among several signs of fresh tensions between the two countries, even as u. s.  trade representative katherine tai and chinese vice premier liu he held their first phone call.  before the talks, tai told reuters that the two sides faced ""very large challenges"" and president joe biden announced that he had ordered the u. s.  intelligence community to ""redouble"" its efforts to determine whether the covid-19 virus had escaped from a chinese lab. biden said in a statement wednesday that chinese officials needed to be more transparent, and that beijing should join an ""evidence-based international investigation and to provide access to all relevant data and evidence. "" the chinese embassy in washington dismissed the inquiry as a ""smear campaign and blame shifting"" that would hurt efforts to prevent future health crises. china foreign ministry spokesman zhao lijian said at a regular press briefing thursday in beijing that the two countries ""stand to gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation. """"china-u. s.  relations will naturally experience some competition, which is prevalent among other major-country relations, but it is wrong to define the relationship with competition because it will only lead to confrontation and conflict,"" he said. the two countries are also locked in disputes over beijing's claims over the south china sea, human rights in the xinjiang region, the future of taiwan and hong kong and economic concerns including the deployment of 5g technology and a global shortage of semiconductors.  chinese and u. s.  officials have said they see areas of cooperation, particularly on climate change, but on many other issues the relationship is far more frosty. ""the u. s.  idea of engagement is one that has conditions and is about bringing china into its system, not only in economics but also in politics,"" said wang yiwei, director of renmin university's institute of international affairs and a former chinese diplomat.  ""the u. s.  sees china overtaking its own economy, so it is looking to contain china and prevent it from moving up the value chain. ""campbell knows well what it's like to negotiate with angry chinese diplomats.  in march he was among u. s.  officials who met with their chinese counterparts in alaska in talks that got off to a rocky start with bickering before reporters and cameras over human rights, trade and international alliances. 'unsentimental' xicampbell said xi was at the heart of the u. s. 's new approach to china ties.  he described the chinese president was ""deeply ideological, but also quite unsentimental"" and ""not terribly interested in economics. ""since coming to power in 2012, xi has ""almost completely disassembled nearly 40 years of mechanisms designed for collective leadership,"" campbell said, adding that top chinese diplomats such as politburo member yang jiechi and foreign minister wang yi -- the senior officials dispatched to the talks in alaska -- are ""nowhere near, within a hundred miles"" of the chinese leader's inner circle. allies will be central to u. s.  efforts to push back against china in the years ahead, campbell said.  the u. s.  has already tried to build up the importance of its work within the so-called quad group of nations, which includes india, japan and australia.  and biden's first meetings at the white house with foreign heads of state were with japan's yoshihide suga and south korea's moon jae-in. ""we believe that the best way to engage a more assertive china is to work with allies, partners and friends,"" campbell said, adding that ""the best china policy really is a good asia policy. "" still, he said the u. s.  will need to dispel fears of american decline in asia and offer a ""positive economic vision"" for the region. ""for the first time, really, we are now shifting our strategic focus, our economic interests, our military might more to the indo-pacific,"" campbell said.

""keith was looking for a new sponsor, and we were looking for partnerships that believe in our mission that could help spread the word.

(the ""company"" or ""valorem"") (cse: valu) (frankfurt: 1xw1) is pleased to provide an update on exploration programs planned for its three gold, nickel, gold-copper, and specimen crystal prospects in british columbia, canada.  the first two properties, the bc gold project and the lac la hache gold project, are located in the cariboo district near the historical and currently active mining town of barkerville in central british columbia, while the third property, the pinto gold-copper project, is in the historical franklin mining camp north of the town of grand forks in south central british columbia.  the bc gold project is located southwest of the main barkerville district (see our news release dated january 29, 2021, and red square on figure 2 below), and a second project also located in the cariboo district, the lac la hache gold project, is located northeast of 100 mile house on the north shore of spout lake.  a third property, the pinto gold-copper project is located in the franklin mining camp north of grand forks in south central british columbia.  bc gold project the bc gold project, totalling 4,000 hectares, is comprised of three claim groups, the west, central and east (see figure 1), extending for approximately 9-15 kms southwest of the osisko development cariboo gold project.  as shown on figure 2, the property area is located in the red rectangle to the southwest of the town of barkerville.  figure 1: https://www. globenewswire. com/newsroom/attachmentng/b4dd3b82-9cdd-468c-b0ba-dec16f83c697 figure 2: https://www. globenewswire. com/newsroom/attachmentng/bd91497c-9f48-45a4-9a17-2f153ed3e5d1 the reader is cautioned that the presence of a deposit on the adjoining osisko development ground does not necessarily indicate that any such mineralization may be present on the company's holdings in the area, or that if discovered, any such mineralization may be economically extracted.  the western claims of the bc gold project are located near the mostique creek and lightening creek placer areas (see b. c.  minfile no.  093g009 and no.  093g060, respectively).  in addition, it covers the gem gold showing, a turbidite-hosted gold target (see b. c.  minfile no.  093g073).  exploration planned for the western claim group containing the two placer showings and the one bedrock showing in black phyllites will consist of in-depth prospecting and sampling of previously excavated pits on the gold showing in bedrock black phyllites, and compilation of all existing min files on this area.  encouraging geochemical values of gold are noted in min files from bedrock sources sampled by previous prospecting.  the central claims contain the sovreign nickel-talc-magnesite showing (assessment file sovreign creek deposit, 093a 013).  also within the central unit are the peters creek surficial placers and the wormwold creek surficial placers.  exploration work planned for the central claims include a re-evaluation of all work done on the nickel and talc zones prospected by historical work to follow up the potential for disseminated nickel values occurring as pentlandite (property file-findlay, 1971).  creek bottom geochemical sampling and ridgeline geochemical sampling and bedrock sampling for both nickel and gold, and prospecting will be conducted throughout the central claims.  the eastern claims cover several potentially economic target types.  the prime targets are the potential for orogenic gold deposits in the snowshoe group of rocks that host many gold occurrences in the barkerville district, plus potential for nickel in serpentinized ultramafic rocks within the property.  also in this claim group are the emerald valley showings of quartz-tourmaline pegmatite veins that host very large quartz and plagioclase feldspar crystals of possible value as gem material or specimen material for potential sale to mineral collectors (assessment report 33212).  both geochemical sampling on creeks and ridges, and prospecting in both the nickel and specimen crystal areas will be undertaken on the eastern claims.  there is no resource delineated on any of the claim groups in the bc gold project holdings lac la hache property the second property, the lac la hache gold project, comprises 180 hectares on the north shore of spout lake in the cariboo gold district located northeast of 100 mile house.  to the south of spout lake engold has been drilling a deposit variously characterized as skarn, carbonate replacement, or porphyry copper deposit containing a modest tonnage of copper-magnetite mineralization.  garibaldi resources has also been exploring a similar discovery in this area.  the upcoming program for the valorem property in this area will consist of geological, geophysical and geochemical surveying to seek a significant deposit in this prospective area.  the property is in the early stage of exploration and no resource has yet been established on the property.  pinto gold project the third property holding, the pinto gold-copper project, covers 80. 9 hectares just north of the historic franklin mining camp located 50 km north of grand forks in south central british columbia.  this property is in an area which has been subject to historical exploration interest by multiple majors during the 1980s, including both noranda exploration company ltd.  and inco ltd.  (see b. c.  minfile no.  082ene19).  several old workings and historical adits and shallow open pits are scattered in the area.  a grab sample by inco in 1989 assayed 6. 829 g/t gold, and a chip sample from a one-meter width of stockwork assayed 4. 6 g/t gold (b. c.  minfile no.  082ene19 and b. c.  assessment report 19385).  the pinto property covers portions of an intrusive complex that contains multiple showings of gold and copper that have been compared to and may be analogous to the historical phoenix mining camp located south of greenwood, b. c. , some 70 km to the southwest of the franklin camp.  the former phoenix mine produced 25. 5 million tonnes of ore averaging 0. 9% copper and 1. 1 grams gold per tonne.  it was mined both from underground and as an open pit from 1900-19 and again from 1956-78 (northern miner press, march 12, 2021).  current vtem surveying is being conducted in the vicinity of the phoenix mine in the search for additional copper-gold deposits.  the presence of copper-gold deposits in the analogous phoenix mine does not infer that any such mineralization may be present on the company's holdings, or that if discovered that any such deposit may be economically recoverable.  exploration on the pinto property will consist of re-evaluation of all available data, prospecting and possibly airborne geophysical vtem surveying to detect the potential for an intrusive-related porphyry copper style deposit.  tony louie, president of the company, stated: ""valorem is very pleased to provide our shareholders with material exposure to the historic cariboo gold district.  the acquisition of the bc gold project and the lac la hache gold project establishes our presence in a premier historic gold camp in bc.  additionally, the pinto gold-copper project provides an entry into the historical franklin mining camp.

2021-05-28,Australia's COVID-19 success under threat as Melbourne goes into lockdown.,"melbourne: five million weary melbourne residents returned to lockdown on friday (may 28), straining local resolve and testing australia's ""zero-covid"" strategy of smothering outbreaks however small. as authorities said the cluster of positive cases had grown to 39, streets in australia's second city emptied out for the fourth time since the pandemic began. ""it's just very difficult,"" resident gavin catt told afp.  ""this lockdown is affecting us.  many families and friends can't work. ""melbournians have been ordered tostay at home for seven daysto stall transmission and buy the authorities time to investigate how the virus again jumped from hotel quarantine into the community. the outbreak is believed to have begun when a traveller infected with a variant first found in india returned to australia, but victoria's acting state premier james merlino called for military help with the investigation. about 15,000 close contacts have been identified and the list of venues visited by confirmed cases had grown to 130. merlino on thursday blamed sluggish vaccine rollout and hotel quarantine failures for the latest outbreak. ""if we had an alternative to hotel quarantine for this particular variant of concern, we would not be here today,"" he said. it is believed to be the 17th time in six months that the virus has leaked out of makeshift hotel quarantine facilities, which are now facing tough scrutiny. fingers are also being pointed at australia's conservative federal government for the slow rate of vaccinations, which threatens to reverse the country's early virus success. australia has recorded 30,000 covid-19 cases since the pandemic began wth a large portion in hotel quarantine in a country of 25 million people. but only 2 per cent of australians have so far been fully vaccinated. ""i'm from new york originally so i feel like we've had a really good go of it here in australia in terms of how many people have gotten sick,"" said david gonzalez. ""so i guess i'm willing to accept a bit of a slow rollout but if these things happen more often, they just have to get more vaccines in the country. ""prime minister scott morrison has defended his government's handling of the crisis saying hotel quarantine facilities were ""99. 99 per cent effective. ""but critics countered that a single infection leaking from a quarantine system that has processed thousands of travellers was sufficient to shut down an entire state, and the country's second-biggest city. in recent months, australians had largely been enjoying few restrictions after the country successfully contained the spread of coronavirus. but outbreaks in taiwan and japan have underscored how initial success containing the virus can quickly be eroded without widespread vaccination. australia is currently vaccinating about 75,000 people each day. in a note to clients on friday, the national australian bank warned that it is ""clear that virus outbreaks from hotel quarantine remain a significant risk for australia until a high degree of vaccine penetration is reached"". ""on the current pace, australia will not reach a level of vaccination approaching herd immunity (estimates suggest that is around 70 per cent or higher) by the end of the year.

2021-05-28,Hong Kong Tycoons Offer $1 Million Flat to Boost Covid-19 Jabs.,"image for representationhong kongers reluctant to get the coronavirus jab have been given a million-dollar reason to roll up their sleeves after property tycoons donated a brand new flat to a vaccine lottery. they will also offer 20 other prizes worth hk$100,000 each. hong kong is one of the few places in the world to have secured more than enough doses to inoculate all 7. 5 million people.  but rampant distrust of the government combined with a lack of urgency in a comparatively virus-free city — has led to hesitancy and a dismally lagging inoculation drive. nothing against ramdev, will consider withdrawing police plaints if he takes back remarks: ima chiefhad no criminal intent to cheat, kalra tells court in oxygen concentrator black marketing caseseeking to boost uptake, sino group, ng teng fong charitable foundation and chinese estates holdings said all hong kong residents aged 18 and above who have received both doses of the covid-19 vaccines will be eligible to register for the lucky draw until september 1. only permanent residents are eligible for the top prize of an apartment in the world's most unaffordable housing market. ""we hope to increase hong kong's vaccination rate through the lucky draw,"" daryl ng, the director of the foundation said in a statement. the groups said further details would released at a later date.  the announcement came three days after the city's chief executive carrie lam rejected calls for the government to offer cash handouts to encourage inoculations.  she suggested local businesses provide the incentives. ""to offer cash or something physical to encourage vaccination shouldn't be done by the government,"" she said. vaccine lotteries have started catching on in the united states, with california, colorado, ohio, new york and oregon offering a chance to win costly prizes. a rural town in the philippines announced it will raffle off a cow to motivate people to get the jab.  hesitancy is common even among the city's medical workers.  earlier this month, the hospital authority revealed only one third of its staff had been vaccinated. on tuesday, the rollout was expanded to non-residents, with around 40,000 chinese mainlanders with travel permits as well as about 13,000 asylum-seekers now eligible for jabs. earlier this week, the hong kong airport authority announced its own giveaway of 60,000 free flights by the end of september to encourage the lagging vaccine rollout.  hong kong's hesitancy comes as many neighbouring countries scramble to secure enough doses to combat spiralling coronavirus outbreaks.  some hong kong politicians have suggested the city could look to send its unused doses overseas if take-up does not improve. read all the latest news, breaking news and

2021-05-28,"Liverpool had alternative Ibrahima Konaté plan, but secret ingredient made him irresistible.","wake up with liverpool. com: as a deal for ibrahima konate nears completion, we assess how he compares to liverpool's alternative centre-back targets. sign up to receive the best lfc opinion direct to your inboxalong with the news that liverpool are on the brink of completing a £35m deal for rb leipzig defender ibrahima konate, which could officially be announced within the next couple of days, it has emerged that liverpool were also considering two other players as alternative centre-back targets before settling on the frenchman as their priority.  marseille's duje caleta-car and villarreal's pau torres were also on the shortlist, according to various  reports, with liverpool having been keen to bring in the former in the january transfer window, only for a £20m deal to be scuppered by marseille not having enough time to find a replacement of their own.  why, then, was konate chosen ahead of the other two to bolster jürgen klopp's defensive options for next season and beyond?in terms of pass completion, they're all fairly similar based on their statistics from the 2020/21 campaign: konate with 86. 4%, caleta-car with 86. 9% and torres a little further ahead with 89. 2%. torres is noticeably superior when it comes to progressive passes (defined as any pass which moves the ball at least 10 yards from its furthest point in the last six passes, excluding passes in the defensive 40% of the pitch, or any pass into the opposition penalty area), averaging 4. 18 per 90, versus 2. 85 for konate and 2. 62 for caleta-car. konate, though, is much more adept at carrying the ball forward with driving runs than he is in terms of his passing ability at this point in his career.  on average, he carried the ball 212 yards towards the opponent's goal per game last season, which puts him in the 96th percentile of all bundesliga centre-backs in this metric.  that's almost double caleta-car's progressive carrying average of 107 yards, and marginally behind torres' average of 218. konate is also an exceptional dribbler, ranking in the 91st percentile of all bundesliga centre-backs for successful take-ons and the 85th percentile for dribble success last season, so his ability to launch attacks in this way will bring a great deal to liverpool's build-up play – something which joe gomez and joel matip also excel in, while virgil van dijk is the outstanding long-range passer of liverpool's current centre-backs. when it comes to aerial duels, konate performs very well, winning 75% on average (in the 94th percentile of bundesliga centre-backs), slightly below caleta-car (77. 7%) but way above torres (60. 6%), which may go some way to explaining why liverpool didn't go for the spaniard despite his excellent on-the-ball numbers. in addition, konate is the tallest of the trio, standing at 6ft 4in, versus caleta-car (6ft 2in) and torres (6ft 3in), as well as being the youngest of the lot, having only just turned 22 this week, compared to the other two who are both 24.  despite his physical stature, konate is also extremely quick, which, given the high defensive line liverpool tend to play, is a hugely valuable attribute. overall, therefore, while torres is the most accomplished in possession-based statistics and caleta-car is the strongest in the air, konate offers an excellent blend of qualities which perhaps makes him the most well-rounded of the three, while still having so much scope for further development.  concerns over his injury record also have seem to have been alleviated following a medical examination. for £35m, liverpool have taken decisive action to safeguard the future of their defence for many years to come, with konate's arrival also taking some of the pressure off van dijk, gomez and matip on their road to recovery. all date in this article was sourced via fbref.

could officially be announced within the next couple of days, it has emerged that liverpool were also considering two other players as alternative centre-back targets before settling on the frenchman as their priority.', ""marseille's duje caleta-car and villarreal's pau torres were also on the shortlist, according to various  reports, with liverpool having been keen to bring in the former in the january transfer window, only for a £20m deal to be scuppered by marseille not having enough time to find a replacement of their own."", ""why, then, was konate chosen ahead of the other two to bolster jürgen klopp's defensive options for next season and beyond?in terms of pass completion, they're all fairly similar based on their statistics from the 2020/21 campaign: konate with 86."", '4%, caleta-car with 86.', '9% and torres a little further ahead with 89.', '2%.', 'torres is noticeably superior when it comes to progressive passes (defined as any pass which moves the ball at least 10

konate and 2.', '62 for caleta-car.', 'konate, though, is much more adept at carrying the ball forward with driving runs than he is in terms of his passing ability at this point in his career.', ""on average, he carried the ball 212 yards towards the opponent's goal per game last season, which puts him in the 96th percentile of all bundesliga centre-backs in this metric."", ""that's almost double caleta-car's progressive carrying average of 107 yards, and marginally behind torres' average of 218. konate is also an exceptional dribbler, ranking in the 91st percentile of all bundesliga centre-backs for successful take-ons and the 85th percentile for dribble success last season, so his ability to launch attacks in this way will bring a great deal to liverpool's build-up play – something which joe gomez and joel matip also excel in, while virgil van dijk is the outstanding long-range passer of liverpool's current centre-backs."", 'when it comes to aerial duels, konate performs very well, winning 75% on average (in the 94th percentile of bundesliga centre-backs), slightly below caleta-car (77.', '7%) but way above torres (60.', ""6%), which may go some way to explaining why liverpool didn't go for the spaniard despite his excellent on-the-ball numbers."", 'in addition, konate is the tallest of the trio, standing at 6ft 4in, versus caleta-car (6ft 2in) and torres (6ft 3in), as well as being the youngest of the lot, having only just turned 22 this week, compared to the other two who are both 24.  despite his physical stature, konate is also extremely quick, which, given the high defensive line liverpool tend to play, is a hugely valuable attribute.', 'overall, therefore, while torres is the most accomplished in possession-based statistics and caleta-car is the strongest in the air, konate offers an excellent blend of qualities which perhaps makes him the most well-rounded of the three, while still having so much scope for further development.', 'concerns over his injury record also have seem to have been alleviated following a medical examination.', ""for £35m, liverpool have taken decisive action to safeguard the future of

2021-05-28,Fight to douse Sri Lanka ship fire could take 'days': navy chief.,"an international firefighting effort to put out a huge blaze on a container ship off sri lanka's coast will likely take days, the country's navy chief said thursday, amid mounting fears of a major oil leak. nine sri lankan ships and three indian vessels have been working with international salvage experts to douse the eight-day old inferno on the singapore-registered x-press pearl. the vessel was carrying nearly 1,500 containers, including 25 tonnes of nitric acid, when a fire broke out as it waited to enter colombo port. it is believed that the fire was sparked by a leak of nitric acid on the 186 metre (610 feet) long ship.  monsoon winds fanned the flames. but easing winds in the indian ocean will make firefighting efforts easier, sri lanka navy chief vice admiral nishantha ulugetenne said, describing the sea and wind conditions as ""favourable"". ""i hope in another few days we can extinguish this fire completely,"" he told afp. sri lanka's marine environment protection authority (mepa) has said it fears the vessel could break up and leak oil onto coastal beaches. ""the hull may not be stable for us to tow the ship away from our waters,"" mepa chairman dharshani lahandapura told afp. the vessel, now anchored, is carrying 278 tonnes of bunker oil and 50 tonnes of marine gasoil, she said. avoidable disaster -lahandapura said the crew knew about a nitric acid leak on may 11 before entering sri lankan waters and that the fire could have been avoided if they acted promptly. the ship's operator, x-press feeders of singapore, confirmed they knew about the acid leak, but said attempts to leave the leaking container in india and qatar had failed. it said port authorities in the two countries had rejected requests because they did not have specialist facilities. sri lankan authorities have lodged a formal complaint with police ahead of initiating legal action against the ship's captain. lahandapura said a large quantity of oil threatens to leak and pollute the tourist and fishing region of negombo, 40 kilometres (25 miles) north of the capital. ""our best option is to clean the beach and we suspect any clearing operation will take a few weeks, if not months,"" she said. sri lankan soldiers were deployed thursday to clean negombo beach as debris from eight containers that fell into the sea after the explosion washed ashore. police also arrested eight people who had been scavenging for plastic raw materials and cosmetics that washed up for violating coronavirus lockdown regulations. in september last year, an oil tanker caught fire off sri lanka's east coast after an engine room explosion that killed one crew member. the fire on the new diamond tanker took more than a week to put out and left a 40 kilometre (25 mile) long oil spill.  sri lanka has demanded the owners pay a $17 million clean-up bill. the 25 crew on the x-press pearl were evacuated on tuesday following the explosion.  two suffered minor injuries, the owners said, and one, an indian national, has tested positive for covid-19. the ship was on its way to colombo from india's gujarat state.  the vessel is anchored 14 kilometres (7. 5 nautical miles) offshore and can be seen from negombo. aj/tw/ohoin a wooded corner of estonia 120 kilometres (75 miles) from the russian border, some 7,000 soldiers are taking part in a nato battleground exercise. a malaysian woman who entered singapore to carry out illegal cosmetic procedures in 2019 was on friday (28 may) jailed for 10 weeks and fined $5,500. $6,600「」,$100「」the grave keeps getting deeper for tajuddin abdul rahman.  this article, after disastrous press conference, ex-prasarana chairman probed for alleged corruption, originally appeared on coconuts, asia's leading alternative media company. find out who stuck with their day jobs and who didn't.  this article, 7 celebrities who married into malaysian royalty, originally appeared on coconuts, asia's leading alternative media company. one of the first robo-advisors in the now crowded space, stashaway is a name well-known by many.  here's what you can expect when you invest your cash or srs funds with stashaway.  as one of the early players in the robo-advisory space in singapore, stashaway [. . . ] the post stashaway review: goal-getting investments through etfs appeared first on singsaver blog we compare, you save. smart,5%!$1,600,!bytedance founder zhang yiming, the brains behind tiktok, said he preferred ""daydreaming"" as he stepped down as head of his own firm last week.  but his departure comes as several of china's once-lauded tech entrepreneurs step aside under increasing scrutiny from a government concerned about their growing power and influence. the ministry of health (moh) on friday (27 may) confirmed 30 new covid-19 cases in singapore, taking the country's total case count to 61,970. hdb flat rentals make up a large part of singapore's property market—according to hdb, there are about 60,000 flats currently being rented out.  we examined rental trends across different hdb estates and here's what we found. 《!》ut,!shares in the parent company of hong kong's pro-democracy apple daily newspaper quadrupled on thursday as trading in them resumed following an eight-day suspension. australia closed its embassy in afghanistan on friday, highlighting security fears for foreign missions and their local workers as us-led troops pull out of the war-torn country. two sleek new roads vanish into mountain tunnels high above a sleepy montenegrin village, the unlikely endpoint of a billion-dollar project bankrolled by china that is threatening to derail the tiny country's economy. 「axa」:,6!the package will assist workers and companies hit by the ongoing phase 2 (heightened alert). aye mar sits with her seven children in their yangon kitchen and worries whether their meal of rice and stringy vegetables -- all she can afford in coup-stricken myanmar -- will satisfy their hunger. hong kong's security chief has warned bankers for jailed media tycoon jimmy lai chee-ying that dealing with his frozen accounts could land them in prison for up to seven years.  when asked whether his move would undermine the reputation of the city as a global financial hub, john lee ka-chiu said on thursday he was following the national security law laid down by beijing last summer that banned acts of subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces.

""will the bank call the loans? will suppliers continue to offer credit terms?"" he said on his facebook page.  noting the statement was issued by the board, leung questioned why it had not made its own assessment during the trading suspension, rather than relying on the management's.  ex-hong kong leader has government on the defensive.  is he planning a comeback? ""who is the person in charge of the management? this is the chief executive officer.  and who is the chief executive officer? he is cheung kim-hung,"" he wrote.  the former leader – who is also a vice-chairman of china's top political advisory body – had already lashed out at cheung before next digital's announcement, revealing on wednesday that he had appointed a lawyer to file a formal complaint with law enforcement against the ceo for making ""negligent, irresponsible and intentionally misleading"" remarks.  leung disputed cheung's suggestion the company's operations and finances would not be affected by the freezing of lai's assets, and demanded a thorough investigation by authorities.  asked about the criticisms, cheung declined to comment.  additional reporting by jeffie lammore from south china morning post:hong kong authorities freeze nearly hk$500 million in assets belonging to media tycoon jimmy laifuture of hong kong's apple daily is on the line after founder jimmy lai's assets are frozen under national security lawthis article national security law: jimmy lai's hong kong bankers warned that handling assets could land them in jail first appeared on south china morning postfor the latest news from the south china morning post download our mobile app.  copyright 2021. !marla40,. $50,. many of the syrian fighters deployed, sometimes forcibly, in foreign conflict theatres such as libya and nagorno-karabakh are robbed of their wages, said a report released thursday. the trial of an australian academic detained for more than two years in china on espionage charges began behind closed doors on thursday, with canberra voicing deep concerns over a lack of transparency after its ambassador was denied access. rafael nadal, novak djokovic and roger federer, the three most successful men in grand slam tennis history, were on thursday all drawn in the same half of the french open. ,.   !five million weary melbourne residents were put back under lockdown on friday, straining local resolve and testing australia's ""zero-covid"" strategy of smothering outbreaks however small. investors rejected the responses of us oil giants to climate change wednesday, installing activist board members at exxonmobil and directing chevron to deepen emissions cuts. belarus on wednesday accused french authorities of committing an act of ""air piracy"" after a belarusian passenger plane flying from minsk to barcelona was denied passage through french airspace and turned back. belarusian state carrier belavia said that flight b2869 with 56 passengers on board had been refused permission to go through french airspace and had to spend around two hours in mid-air before returning to minsk.

prison for up to seven years.  when asked whether his move would undermine the reputation of the city as a global financial hub, john lee ka-chiu said on thursday he was following the national security law laid down by beijing last summer that banned acts of subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces.  ""i am exercising the power because lai has been charged with two offences of collusion with other countries or external forces to endanger national security,"" he said.  ""it is my duty to specify in my notice to the relevant parties what will be the consequences if they fail to comply with my direction.

""will the bank call the loans? will suppliers continue to offer credit terms?"" he said on his facebook page.  noting the statement was issued by the board, leung questioned why it had not made its own assessment during the trading suspension, rather than relying on the management's.  ex-hong kong leader has government on the defensive.  is he planning a comeback? ""who is the person in charge of the management? this is the chief executive officer.  and who is the chief executive officer? he is cheung kim-hung,"" he wrote.  the former leader – who is also a vice-chairman of china's top political advisory body – had already lashed out at cheung before next digital's announcement, revealing on wednesday that he had appointed a lawyer to file a formal complaint with law enforcement against the ceo for making ""negligent, irresponsible and intentionally misleading"" remarks.  leung disputed cheung's suggestion the company's operations and finances would not be affected by the freezing of lai's assets, and demanded a thorough investigation by authorities.  asked about the criticisms, cheung declined to comment.  additional reporting by jeffie lammore from south china morning post:hong kong authorities freeze nearly hk$500 million in assets belonging to media tycoon jimmy laifuture of hong kong's apple daily is on the line after founder jimmy lai's assets are frozen under national security lawthis article national security law: jimmy lai's hong kong bankers warned that handling assets could land them in jail first appeared on south china morning postfor the latest news from the south china morning post download our mobile app.  copyright 2021. the trial of an australian academic detained for more than two years in china on espionage charges began behind closed doors on thursday, with canberra voicing deep concerns over a lack of transparency after its ambassador was denied access. australia closed its embassy in afghanistan on friday, highlighting security fears for foreign missions and their local workers as us-led troops pull out of the war-torn country.

2021-05-28,Engine No. 1’s Exxon Win Provides Boost for ESG Advocates.,"the rejection of exxon mobil corp. 's management team marks one of the most significant victories for shareholders who have been pushing for drastic action on climate change. the movement to transform exxon's board of directors was led by a previously little-known hedge fund called engine no.  1, which has just a 0. 02% stake in exxon and no history of activism in oil and gas.  the firm gained at least two board seats at exxon's annual shareholder meeting wednesday and promised to push the crude driller to diversify beyond oil.  engine no.  1 was backed by two of the largest u. s.  pension funds and some of the world's biggest asset management firms, including blackrock inc. the exxon vote sends an important message not only to exxon and the other big oil companies, but ""also to esg investors at large,"" said bloomberg intelligence analyst rob du boff.  ""the fact that asset managers such as blackrock were swayed by engine no.  1's cause is another sign that esg issues, and climate change in particular, are now mainstream. ""the $255 billion new york state common retirement fund and the $300 billion california state teachers' retirement system have been promoting climate-friendly corporate policies and environmental, social and governance investment principles for years now, and both got behind engine no.  1's exxon push.  so did the church commissioners for england and blackrock, which has been criticized for its uneven track record on supporting environmental-related shareholder resolutions. esg advocates said the rebuke of exxon is going to make it much easier for sustainability investors.  ""just a few years ago we were ignored, but now companies know that they have to pick up the phone and speak with esg investors,"" said kristin hull, founder of nia impact capital in san francisco. ""esg is now core to investment processes and decisions,"" said kalina lazarova, a london-based director in bmo global asset management's responsible-investment team.  ""environmental and social issues can now make or break directors in a way that wasn't previously possible. ""engine no.  1, though a tiny company, was successful because ""it tapped into broadly held discontent among investors who are ever more sensitive to climate and broader esg topics,"" lazarova said. catherine howarth, chief executive officer of shareaction, a nonprofit focused on responsible investing, agreed.  ""engine no.  1 forced all these big investors to take a side,"" she said. ""for years we were told by large institutional investors that behind closed doors they were getting there with companies in the oil and gas sector, but they have delivered so little,"" howarth said.  meantime, engine no.  1 is ""really moving the field,"" she said. blackrock, the second-largest holder of exxon, with a 6. 6% stake, voted for three of the new directors nominated by engine no.  1, according to a vote bulletin published wednesday.  but the investment giant also backed chief executive officer darren woods, who opposed investor demands for a change to the company's approach on climate change -- a move that rankled environmental groups who called for the firm to vote against them. blackrock said in its bulletin that it was ""concerned about exxon's strategic direction"" and that the company could benefit from the addition of the new directors who would ""bring the fresh perspectives"" to exxon's board. exxon's failure to act on previous investor demands to tackle climate change led to the company's loss, said new york comptroller thomas dinapoli.  ""the fact that exxon hasn't been responsive up until now, in a way they set the stage for their own defeat,"" he said wednesday in a bloomberg tv interview. watch: new york state comptroller thomas dinapoli talks about exxon's board vote. source: bloombergcalstrs called the exxon vote ""historic. "" it represents a tipping point for companies unprepared for the global energy transition, the pension fund said.  while the exxon board election is the first of a large u. s.  company to focus on the global energy transition, it won't be the last, according to the statement. chevron corp. , another oil giant, also suffered a rebuke from shareholders at its annual meeting wednesday when investors voted for a proposal to compel the company to reduce pollution by its customers.  additionally, a dutch court issued a ruling wednesday that ordered royal dutch shell plc to slash its net carbon emissions. these decisions send ""a strong signal that esg is mainstream,"" said timothy smith, director of esg shareowner engagement at boston trust walden.  ""corporations are realizing that these issues aren't fringe anymore. ""climate-focused investors ""built the intellectual scaffolding that enabled engine no.  1 to get two of its nominees on the board,"" said jonas kron, chief advocacy officer at trillium asset management.  ""esg investors have told companies for years to think honestly and transparently about climate change risk management.  the market has now caught up.

2021-05-28,"Temporary Covid-19 grant of up to $700 for lower- to middle-income and self-employed workers, Singapore News & Top Stories.","read 3 articles daily and stand to win st rewards, including the st news tablet worth $398. spin the wheel for st read and win now. singapore lower- to middle-income workers who are financially impacted by the latest covid-19 restrictions may receive a one-time payout of up to $700 under a new temporary grant, the ministry of finance (mof) said on friday (may 28). the grant covers those who are self-employed as well. eligible workers who have been placed on involuntary no-pay leave for at least a month from may 16 to june 30, or who have suffered an income loss of at least 50 per cent for at least a month over the same period, may apply for the new covid-19 recovery grant (temporary) (crg-t). mof said the grant, part of an $800 million support package that is being rolled out to help individuals and businesses amid the current heightened alert period, is being introduced as the livelihoods of some workers in the food and beverage, retail, and sports and fitness sectors have been affected. under the grant, eligible individuals placed on involuntary no-pay leave may receive a one-off payout of up to $700, while those experiencing significant income loss may receive a one-off payout of up to $500. mof said applications will be open from june 3 to july 2. the ministry of social and family development (msf) will release more details shortly. crg-t is a supplement to the existing covid-19 recovery grant (crg), which was launched on jan 18 to support lower- to middle-income workers and self-employed people affected by the pandemic, finance minister lawrence wong said at a press conference on friday. ""there are certain conditions and criteria attached to the crg.  we are not changing that.  but we are, in a way, piggybacking on the existing scheme with a temporary scheme with different conditions specific to the current heightened alert situation, where activities have been scaled back and there are these additional restrictions. """"so this is temporary, it's meant for this particular period.  after that we will continue with the regular crg scheme,"" mr wong added. the crg, which was extended by three months in march, provides up to $700 per month for three months for workers who have lost jobs or have been placed on involuntary no-pay leave due to covid-19. for lower- to middle-income workers and self-employed people facing income loss of at least 50 per cent for at least three consecutive months, the crg provides up to $500 a month for three months. msf said in march that the crg had supported more than 10,000 people and disbursed about $10 million as at march 22. there will also be additional support for polytechnic and autonomous university graduates who have to repay student loans, said mof. the ministry of education (moe) will extend the suspension of loan repayments and interest charges by another four months, until sept 30.  with the extension, no interest, whether standard or penalty interest, will be levied on any outstanding loan for the additional four-month period. these include tuition fee loans, study loans and overseas student programme loans, which are all government loans. moe said in a statement that those with outstanding loans will be automatically granted the extension.  these include graduates who have already started paying back their loans, and students with outstanding loans who will graduate before sept 30. those who wish to continue repaying their student loans can do so by informing their tertiary institutions and banks to make the necessary arrangements. moe had previously suspended loan repayments and interest charges for a year, from june 1 last year to may 31 this year. the finance ministry said the four-month extension will give graduates more time to find a stable financial footing, and to plan their finances. mr wong said there is scope to extend the loan repayment suspension even further.  but that will depend on the state of the current outbreak and whether the economy can recover from it. he said: ""before the latest round of heightened alert measures, the economic outlook was improving. . .  and if you look at the employment prospects for fresh graduates, it was also improving. ""but given the latest situation, the uncertainty that the new strains have posed not just to singapore but also to the global economy. . .  we discussed with moe and decided that we would give a short extension. ""mr wong added: ""if the situation indeed does improve, and this current outbreak proves to be temporary, we get back to our recovery trajectory and the external economy remains strong, then i think september should be a reasonable timeframe. ""but if things were to worsen, be it on the external front or even within singapore in terms of our own growth trajectory, then, of course, we will be prepared to reconsider and see if further extensions are needed. ""meanwhile, mof also highlighted support measures for private-hire and taxi drivers, as well as retailers at changi airport, announced over the past two weeks. private-hire and taxi drivers will receive additional cash support of $10 per vehicle per day for the period of may 16 till the end of june, with the government setting aside an additional $27 million as a one-off top-up to the covid-19 driver relief fund. changi airport group on monday said it was fully waiving rental fees for retailers in changi airport terminals from may 13 to june 13 while the airport remains closed to the public. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

$800 million support package that is being rolled out to help individuals and businesses amid the current heightened alert period, is being introduced as the livelihoods of some workers in the food and beverage, retail, and sports and fitness sectors have been affected.', 'under the grant, eligible individuals placed on involuntary no-pay leave may receive a one-off payout of up to $700, while

their tertiary institutions and banks to make the necessary arrangements.', 'moe had previously suspended loan repayments and interest charges for a year, from june 1 last year to may 31 this year.',

""overall, we're in an unpredictable situation,"" suga told reporters after the meeting.  ""we'll make a decision after speaking with experts tomorrow. ""japan also could extend intensive anti-coronavirus measures now in place elsewhere in the country.  these are set to expire monday in five prefectures, including three in the greater tokyo area. sign up to our newsletters to get our best stories delivered straight to your inbox. discover the all new nikkei asia appdiscover the all new nikkei asia appstay ahead with our exclusives on asia; the most dynamic market in the world. stay ahead with our exclusives on asiaget trusted insights from experts within asia itself. get trusted insights from experts within asia itself.

2021-05-28,"Glad the truth is out, says police officer accused of bullying elderly woman in Yishun, Singapore News & Top Stories.","read 3 articles daily and stand to win st rewards, including the st news tablet worth $398. spin the wheel for st read and win now. singapore a police officer who was accused of bullying an elderly woman in yishun has spoken out, saying that while the accusations were upsetting at first, he will not stop helping members of the public when duty calls. station inspector jeff lim kok hwee, 45, a deputy team leader at yishun south neighbourhood police centre, shared his side of the story, adding that he is glad that ""the truth is out"". on may 19, the singapore police force refuted allegations circulating online that four police officers, including station insp lim, had told the elderly woman off for not wearing her mask. the social media posts claimed that the officers had abused their authority in dealing with the elderly woman. two days later, the fake news law was invoked by home affairs minister k.  shanmugam, requiring an instagram user as well as the singapore uncensored and the online citizen asia (toc) websites to carry correction notices for their posts on the incident. but after toc doubled down on its claims, the police released two clips of body-worn camera footage on tuesday (may 25), taken from the officers involved in the incident. the footage showed station insp lim buying the woman a packet of food from a nearby stall and instructing the woman's domestic helper to remind her to wear a mask when she is out. speaking to the media on friday, station insp lim said he was called to the scene on the evening of may 17 after receiving a call from a member of the public about an elderly woman who appeared to be lost and was not wearing a mask. when he arrived with three of his colleagues, he said he tried to make her comfortable by sitting down to chat with her. ""through chatting with her, i understood that she was waiting for her friends and i was concerned that she might be hungry, and that's when i offered to buy her food,"" he said. ""she requested two chicken wings with chilli, and that's what i bought for her. ""station insp lim said that after handing the food which he paid for out of his own pocket to the elderly woman, he offered to accompany her home, but she refused. through his interactions with her, he realised that she may have dementia as she did not seem to remember her name or where she lived. a passer-by then informed the officers that the woman lived in a housing board block nearby.  two of station insp lim's colleagues then combed the block to identify the unit where she lives, while station insp lim and one colleague stayed with her. when they found the flat, the police officers asked the woman's domestic helper to go downstairs to fetch her. when the domestic helper arrived at the scene, station insp lim told her to remind the elderly woman to wear a mask when she is out. ""i did not raise my voice,"" he said, refuting allegations made by toc. station insp lim said he did not expect the incident to be twisted to depict him and his colleagues in a negative manner. ""i felt wronged initially.  but this whole incident shouldn't stop us from helping members of the public and in carrying out our duties,"" he said. he also addressed toc's subsequent interviews with the elderly woman, who said the police officers had bullied her. ""i did not take it personally.  i understand that she has dementia and she might not remember what had happened,"" he said. on tuesday, mr shanmugam defended the officers involved, noting that station insp lim is ""an officer with a heart"" who does volunteer work with family service centres in his spare time, and has gone overseas to help when natural disasters struck. in 2015, station insp lim and eight other officers raised $8,000 from friends, family and colleagues to buy daily necessities and clothing for more than 120 families in kathmandu affected by the nepal earthquake. when they returned, they decided to formalise the grouping to continue their efforts to help those in need.  today, the group counts 51 police officers as members.  they make monthly contributions to fund food and other necessities to the ang mo kio family service centre and underprivileged people overseas.

station insp lim said he hopes the public will not believe everything they see on the internet, but instead try to discern the truth for themselves. ""they (toc) can do what they want, but they should have the responsibility to post something that is factual online,"" he said. on thursday, instagram user @nichology, who originally posted the video of station insp lim and the other officers and accused them of bullying the elderly woman, apologised. ""i am sorry to have jumped to conclusions and for the accusatory tone used on my instagram stories about the police officers,"" he wrote. he added that he accepts responsibility for his actions and the resulting consequences. ""i understand that it was quick and unfair of me to judge so quickly and harshly.  i would definitely be more careful in future,"" he said, adding that he did not have any malicious intent nor did he intend to ""share fake news"". ""while i still believe that citizen journalism is important to provide a community viewpoint, in this case, it also showed that it may cause misjudgments and misunderstandings,"" he said.  join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

frozen accounts could land them in prison for up to seven years.  when asked whether his move would undermine the reputation of the city as a global financial hub, john lee ka-chiu said on thursday he was following the national security law laid down by beijing last summer that banned acts of subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces.  ""i am exercising the power because lai has been charged with two offences of collusion with other countries or external forces to endanger national security,"" he said.  ""it is my duty to specify in my notice to the relevant parties what will be the consequences if they fail to comply with my direction.

""will the bank call the loans? will suppliers continue to offer credit terms?"" he said on his facebook page.  noting the statement was issued by the board, leung questioned why it had not made its own assessment during the trading suspension, rather than relying on the management's.  ex-hong kong leader has government on the defensive.  is he planning a comeback? ""who is the person in charge of the management? this is the chief executive officer.  and who is the chief executive officer? he is cheung kim-hung,"" he wrote.  the former leader – who is also a vice-chairman of china's top political advisory body – had already lashed out at cheung before next digital's announcement, revealing on wednesday that he had appointed a lawyer to file a formal complaint with law enforcement against the ceo for making ""negligent, irresponsible and intentionally misleading"" remarks.  leung disputed cheung's suggestion the company's operations and finances would not be affected by the freezing of lai's assets, and demanded a thorough investigation by authorities.  asked about the criticisms, cheung declined to comment.  additional reporting by jeffie lammore from south china morning post:hong kong authorities freeze nearly hk$500 million in assets belonging to media tycoon jimmy laifuture of hong kong's apple daily is on the line after founder jimmy lai's assets are frozen under national security lawthis article national security law: jimmy lai's hong kong bankers warned that handling assets could land them in jail first appeared on south china morning postfor the latest news from the south china morning post download our mobile app.  copyright 2021. ,.   !many of the syrian fighters deployed, sometimes forcibly, in foreign conflict theatres such as libya and nagorno-karabakh are robbed of their wages, said a report released thursday. the trial of an australian academic detained for more than two years in china on espionage charges began behind closed doors on thursday, with canberra voicing deep concerns over a lack of transparency after its ambassador was denied access. aye mar sits with her seven children in their yangon kitchen and worries whether their meal of rice and stringy vegetables -- all she can afford in coup-stricken myanmar -- will satisfy their hunger. 「」$1,000!(25) ,,,,2!rafael nadal, novak djokovic and roger federer, the three most successful men in grand slam tennis history, were on thursday all drawn in the same half of the french open. five million weary melbourne residents were put back under lockdown on friday, straining local resolve and testing australia's ""zero-covid"" strategy of smothering outbreaks however small. investors rejected the responses of us oil giants to climate change wednesday, installing activist board members at exxonmobil and directing chevron to deepen emissions cuts.

2021-05-28,Millions in Myanmar struggle to buy food as coup price hike bites.,"yangon: aye mar sits with her seven children in their yangon kitchen and worries whether their meal of rice and stringy vegetables all she can afford in coup-stricken myanmar will satisfy their hunger. the national economy and banking system have been paralysed since a military power-grab which pushed civilian leader aung san suu kyi out of office in february. livelihoods have been lost after strikes and factory closures, fuel prices have shot up and those lucky enough to have bank savings face day-long queues to withdraw their cash. venturing out in public to earn a living has also become a safety hazard against the backdrop of an indiscriminate and brutal crackdown on dissent that has killed more than 800 civilians, according to a local monitoring group. in a country which in normal times exports rice, beans and fruit, millions will go hungry in the coming months, the world food programme has warned. ""we have to feed our children so they don't starve,"" aye mar says, sitting barefoot in the commercial capital, a baby swinging in a hammock overhead. the 33-year-old is out of work, along with her husband who has been forced to take any odd job on offer including digging septic tanks. food vendor wah wah, 37, says price increases since the coup mean customers can no longer afford something as modest as a bowl of dried fish. ""i can't sell it because customers cannot afford to buy it . . .  even if i sell it at 500 kyats (us$0. 33) per bowl,"" she told afp. ""everyone has to spend money carefully to be safe because no one has jobs.  we live with fear because we don't know what will happen. """"we are in trouble""father-of-three win naing tun, 26, said those who could previously afford to eat pork regularly have been forced to turn to fish paste and vegetables. and those who survived on that limited diet before ""now can only afford to eat white rice with salt"", he told afp. price hikes have hit remote areas particularly hard near the chinese border in kachin state, rice is almost 50 per cent more expensive, according to the wfp. the cost of transporting produce from farms to cities has also jumped after an estimated 30 per cent fuel price hike since the coup. the wfp estimates that within the next six months, as many as 3. 4 million more people will go hungry in myanmar and it is poised to triple its emergency food assistance. a grassroots community food donation programme is proving to be in high demand in yangon, myanmar's commercial capital. ""they are happy when we donate food.  some even cry,"" volunteer may, not her real name, told afp. ni aye, 51, said she and her husband now have no income at all and depend on handouts for the food they eat. ""we are in trouble . . .  if these conditions continue we will starve,"" she told afp. aung kyaw moe, 47, is considering returning to his home village after the yangon factory he worked in shut down. he told afp he had no money saved up and was in despair over how to support his family of nine, who are squatting illegally with him in the commercial capital.

2021-05-28,Man admits throwing faeces at cop in police station lock-up.,"singapore — a man who was arrested for theft defecated into a paper cup while in a police lock-up and then threw his faeces at an auxiliary policeman, a court heard. at the state courts on friday (28 may), the 34-year-old culprit sulaiman abdul majid maricar pleaded guilty to one charge of using criminal force on a public servant and five other counts including theft and housebreaking to commit theft.  he will be sentenced at a later date pending a report on his suitability for preventive detention, which is a sentencing option meant to protect the public from recalcitrant offenders, who must serve a jail term of between seven and 20 years in full with no reduction given for good behaviour. on 13 october last year, sulaiman was arrested for stealing from a vehicle.  he was placed in a lock-up at the woodlands police division headquarters.  it was his second time being arrested for theft from a vehicle in a week.  he had been arrested on 9 october and released on bail the next day after stealing three handphones and a power bank of unknown value along with a cash card with a stored value of about $40 from a rag-and-bone man's lorry. while in the lock-up on 14 october, sulaiman was given lunch and a paper cup containing a drink.  he later defecated into the paper cup and kept his faeces in it. at about 6. 30pm, an auxiliary policeman went to sulaiman's cell to pass him his dinner.  but the latter took the paper cup containing his faeces and threw it at the officer, causing the excrement to land on the cop's uniform, over his torso, his pants and his boots. the officer asked sulaiman to explain his actions but the latter simply ignored him.  the auxiliary policeman then reported the incident to his superior and went to clean himself up. out on bail just a week later, sulaiman and his then girlfriend nurul natasha roslan, 26, stole a $7,000 motorcycle from an open carpark in marine crescent at about 1am on 21 october.  its owner had accidentally left his keys in the ignition as he was tired.  he had also left his helmet on the motorbike. at the time, sulaiman was under a 25-year driving ban which took effect from april last year.  he also rode the bike without valid insurance policy.  then on 23 october, at around midnight, sulaiman and natasha broke into a food centre in tai seng, kim chuan eating house, and made off with $430 from the cash register of a drink stall. the couple were arrested at a hotel at about 1. 45am the next day.  the motorcycle they had stolen three days earlier was found parked at the hotel and returned to its owner.  in 2009, sulaiman was also convicted of housebreaking at night.  the maximum punishment for housebreaking is up to 10 years' jail along and a fine.  male repeat offenders who are below 50 are liable to be caned. more singapore news:stay in the know on-the-go: join yahoo singapore's telegram channel at http://t.

jimmy lai chee-ying that dealing with his frozen accounts could land them in prison for up to seven years.  when asked whether his move would undermine the reputation of the city as a global financial hub, john lee ka-chiu said on thursday he was following the national security law laid down by beijing last summer that banned acts of subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces.  ""i am exercising the power because lai has been charged with two offences of collusion with other countries or external forces to endanger national security,"" he said.  ""it is my duty to specify in my notice to the relevant parties what will be the consequences if they fail to comply with my direction.

""will the bank call the loans? will suppliers continue to offer credit terms?"" he said on his facebook page.  noting the statement was issued by the board, leung questioned why it had not made its own assessment during the trading suspension, rather than relying on the management's.  ex-hong kong leader has government on the defensive.  is he planning a comeback?

2021-05-28,"Request to drop word 'country' preceded BioNTech vaccine deal collapse, says Taiwan.","taipei: germany's biontech asked taiwan to remove the word ""country"" from an announcement they planned to make on a covid-19 vaccine sale to the island, its health minister said on thursday (may 27), giving details of the deal whose axing was blamed on china by taipei. taiwan and china are engaged in an escalating war of words after beijing offered the shots to the chinese-claimed island via shanghai fosun pharmaceutical group, which has a contract to sell them in greater china. taiwan health minister chen shih-chung told a daily news briefing the government had signed and sent back a ""final contract"" agreed with biontech after months of negotiations, and the two sides were on the verge of issuing a press release on jan 8. but four hours later ""biontech suddenly sent a letter, saying they strongly recommend us to change the word 'our country' in the chinese version of the press release"", chen said. the government agreed to tweak the wording to ""taiwan"" on the same day, he added. a week later, chen said, his government was informed by biontech the completion of the deal will be delayed due to a ""revaluation of global vaccine supply and adjusted timelines"". ""it's crystal clear to me that the contract was finalised,"" he added. ""there's no problem within the contract.  the problem was something outside of the contract,"" he said, without elaborating. biontech declined to comment. china considers taiwan its own territory and strongly objects to any references that imply taiwan is a separate country. chen's comments came a day after taiwan president tsai ing-wen directly accused china of blocking the deal with biontech. the german company, which sells its vaccine in partnership with pfizer, declined to comment on tsai's remarks. taiwan's medical system is coming under increasing strain due to a spike in domestic infections with only about 1 per cent of the population of more than 23 million vaccinated. china has repeatedly said its vaccine offer via biontech's chinese sales agent fosun is sincere and taiwan should not put up political roadblocks. taiwan does not believe china is sincere in offering it vaccines and thinks beijing is launching a ""political warfare"" against the island, officials briefed on the matter told reuters. taiwan announced 667 new domestic covid-19 cases on thursday, including 266 cases added to previous days' totals. it has reported 6,761 infections since the pandemic began, including 59 deaths. downloadour appor subscribe to our telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:https://cna. asia/telegramit looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-05-28,"Covid-19 cases in Australia's Victoria fall on first day of lockdown, Australia/NZ News & Top Stories.","read 3 articles daily and stand to win st rewards, including the st news tablet worth $398. spin the wheel for st read and win now. sydney (reuters, afp) australia's victoria state reported four new locally acquired covid-19 cases on friday (may 28), the first day of a one-week hard lockdown imposed to contain a growing coronavirus outbreak in state capital melbourne. victoria, australia's second most populous state, entered the lockdown on thursday night, due to run until june 3, forcing its near seven million residents to remain home except for essential business. the state reported 12 locally acquired cases a day earlier. crowds have been banned from sporting events and people ordered to stay home except for work, exercise, shopping for essentials, providing care and getting vaccinated. in melbourne, five million weary residents returned to lockdown on friday, straining local resolve and testing australia's ""zero-covid"" strategy of smothering outbreaks however small. as authorities said the cluster of positive cases had grown to 39, streets in australia's second city emptied out for the fourth time since the pandemic began. ""it's just very difficult,"" resident gavin catt told afp.  ""this lockdown is affecting us.  many families and friends can't work. "" melbournians have been ordered to stay at home for seven days to stall transmission and buy the authorities time to investigate how the virus again jumped from hotel quarantine into the community. the outbreak is believed to have begun when a traveller infected with the indian variant returned to australia, but victoria's acting state premier james merlino called for military help with the investigation. mr merlino on thursday blamed sluggish vaccine rollout and hotel quarantine failures for the latest outbreak. ""if we had an alternative to hotel quarantine for this particular variant of concern, we would not be here today,"" he said. it is believed to be the 17th time in six months that the virus has leaked out of makeshift hotel quarantine facilities, which are now facing tough scrutiny. fingers are also being pointed at australia's conservative federal government for the slow rate of vaccinations, which threatens to reverse the country's early virus success. australia has recorded 30,000 covid-19 cases since the pandemic began – with a large portion in hotel quarantine – in a country of 25 million people. but only 2 per cent of australians have so far been fully vaccinated. ""i'm from new york originally so i feel like we've had a really good go of it here in australia in terms of how many people have gotten sick,"" said mr david gonzalez. ""so i guess i'm willing to accept a bit of a slow rollout but if these things happen more often, they just have to get more vaccines in the country. ""the australian olympic committee said it was ""assessing the impacts"" of the melbourne lockdown on athletes completing their vaccinations in the city of 5 million. a protracted lockdown to control a second wave outbreak in victoria last year forced more than a dozen melbourne-based sports teams to play away from home for several months to complete their seasons. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-05-28,Jailed HK tycoon Jimmy Lai sentenced to 14 months for Oct 1 illegal assembly.,"hong kong: jailed hong kong media tycoon and beijing critic jimmy lai was given a new prison sentence of 14 months on friday (may 28) over his role in an unauthorised assembly on oct 1, 2019, during one of the city's pro-democracy rallies that year. this month, lai, who is serving a 14-month sentence for participating in similar demonstrations on aug 18 and aug 31, 2019, and nine other activists, pleaded guilty in district court to organising an unauthorised assembly. he has been in jail since december after being denied bail in a separate national security trial.  he faces three charges under the new law, introduced by china in 2020 in response to the protests, including collusion with a foreign country. lai's repeated arrests have drawn criticism from western governments and international rights groups, who raised concerns over waning freedoms in the global financial hub, including freedom of speech and assembly. beijing sees him as a traitor and an anti-china instigator. china says the sweeping security law, which punishes anything beijing considers as subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison, was vital to restore stability and prosperity. judge amanda woodcock, who handed lai his previous illegal assembly sentence in april, delivered the sentence on friday.  she said part of the new sentence would be served consecutively, meaning lai faces a total of 20 months in prison so far. there were major clashes on oct 1, china's national day, including a live round shot by a policeman at a protester swinging a long stick, the first use of a handgun after months of demonstrations. ""they did call for a peaceful, rational and non-violent procession but how naive and unrealistic was that considering what was happening on a daily basis was the opposite,"" woodcock said.  ""this is not with hindsight.  the risk was very real every day at that time. ""the other nine defendants, including activists figo chan, lee cheuk-yan, albert ho and leung kwok-hung, who is known in hong kong as long hair, were sentenced to up to 18 months.  two received suspended sentences.

2021-05-28,"Old-school HK tycoons losing to China's moguls, Economy News & Top Stories.","read 3 articles daily and stand to win st rewards, including the st news tablet worth $398. spin the wheel for st read and win now. hong kong • the prediction was vintage jack ma, as provocative as it was prescient. ""this is the era of the internet,"" the chinese billionaire proclaimed in october 2013, just weeks after his plan to take alibaba group holding public in hong kong had been scuttled by regulators.  ""it no longer belongs to li ka-shing. ""mr ma's dig at the famed hong kong tycoon raised plenty of eyebrows at the time, but few would disagree with him now.  the past few years have seen a remarkable shift in fortunes between china's tech-savvy moguls and their old-school hong kong counterparts a trend that shows few signs of fading any time soon. the combined wealth of china's 10 richest people has surged threefold since 2016 to us$425 billion (s$563 billion), according to the bloomberg billionaires index.  for hong kong, it doubled to us$218 billion during the same period. mr li, once asia's richest person, is now ranked no.  13, several spots below mr ma, who eventually listed alibaba in new york in 2014. the changes underscore the fading relevance of hong kong businessmen who built their empires on real estate, ports, infrastructure, telecommunications, aviation and retail. at their peak, when the former british colony was the indispensable gateway to a rapidly developing mainland china, mr li and his peers were courted by beijing for their business acumen and access to overseas capital.  these days their political clout is waning and their businesses are increasingly viewed by investors as stale. what's more, hong kong's future as a financial hub is facing an existential threat as china's communist party chips away at the ""one country, two systems"" framework that has underpinned the city's success for decades. one consequence has been a dramatic slide in the stock market valuations for hong kong's biggest conglomerates.  over the past five years, five of the city's top groups ck hutchison holdings, new world development, henderson land development, sun hung kai properties and wharf holdings have consistently traded at deep discounts to their net assets. their shares now fetch just 0. 5 times book value on average, versus 10 for the five companies controlled by some of china's richest tycoons, data compiled by bloomberg show. the main businesses of the large hong kong companies don't have much growth. . .  investors prefer to focus on growth more than on a company's value. ""the main businesses of the large hong kong companies don't have much growth,"" said mr andy wong, founding partner at lw asset management in the city.  ""investors prefer to focus on growth more than on a company's value,"" he said, adding that technology-driven sectors are attractive, especially after the pandemic. while private family offices of some of the city's tycoons have pivoted to high-growth investments, their listed businesses have been slow to catch up. on the other hand, their counterparts across the border have leveraged technology to provide a range of consumer services and create wealth.  chinese tycoons have also benefited from the us$14. 3 trillion economy's quick recovery from covid.  china was the only major economy to expand last year, while hong kong saw back-to-back contractions in 2019 and 2020. most of china's richest billionaires come from the tech industry, including tencent holdings' pony ma, bytedance founder zhang yiming and netease's william ding.  the wealth of zhong shanshan, china's richest person and founder of bottled water giant nongfu spring, is almost us$69 billion, more than double that of mr li's. many of hong kong's business empires owe their success to government policies that encouraged only a small group of deep-pocketed developers to bid at auctions of land parcels, a system that turned hong kong into the world's most expensive property market. the windfall from rising prices allowed the tycoons to diversify into utilities, retail, ports and infrastructure.  but that formula has been difficult to replicate in larger markets like mainland china due to high capital requirements, local competition and regulatory barriers, said mr richard harris, founder of hong kong-based port shelter investment management. the result is that many of the city's tycoons have focused on defending their current turf rather than expanding into new businesses, mr harris said.  ""many of them are quite happy making sure they don't lose"" what they have, he added.  yet even that has proven difficult in recent years as hong kong's economy was battered by anti-government protests and the pandemic. sun hung kai properties, the developer led by billionaire brothers raymond and thomas kwok, reported the biggest decline in underlying profit since 2013 for the year ended june. swire pacific, one of city's two centuries-old british trading firms, recorded an underlying loss last year, the first since listing in 1959.  its flagship cathay pacific airways is struggling despite a government-led rescue. ck hutchison, the flagship of the diversified empire mr li built after his family fled to hong kong from the mainland as refugees in 1940, saw its first profit drop since a revamp of the conglomerate in 2015. as tensions rise between china and the west, the ck group is facing headwinds overseas.  australia blocked it from acquiring a local gas pipeline operator over national security concerns in 2018. some of hong kong's conglomerates have started looking further afield for growth opportunities.  new world development, which is into infrastructure building, hotels and shopping malls, is accelerating its expansion into insurance, health care and education in mainland china. chief executive officer adrian cheng has said he wants to grow the non-property service businesses.  much of the effort ""revolves around non-traditional businesses"", a spokesman said. swire pacific is investing in healthcare groups in mainland china.  jardine matheson holdings, the owner of luxury hotel group mandarin oriental international, is partnering with private equity firm hillhouse capital management to look for investment opportunities in greater china and south-east asia. representatives for sun hung kai declined to comment, while ck group and wharf did not respond to requests for comment.  swire said the group's financial strength and ability to invest remain strong, and is looking at new sectors.  henderson land said it has been diversifying from property, with a strong presence in hong kong and china, and has been incorporating sustainable technologies. mr li's personal investment vehicle, horizons ventures, has been investing in plant-based food, renewable energy and digital services.  the firm's early bet in zoom video communications surged to us$11 billion last year during the pandemic, or one-third of mr li's wealth.  he was also an early backer of facebook, spotify technology and siri. the post-pandemic recovery will be crucial for hong kong's tycoons to consider similar bets on emerging industries, according to mr falcon chan, a partner at deloitte china.

""therefore, we do not think there is a need for further tightening in our overall posture,"" he said, adding that the multi-ministry task force on covid-19 will give a fuller update at a press conference on monday. if there are further extensions of the restrictions beyond june 13, mof will consider whether support measures can be similarly extended, he added. mr wong, who co-chairs the task force, said the financial support package handed out this time round is not on the same scale as those allocated last year. this is because most parts of the economy are still operating, and there are also more government schemes, like the jobs growth incentive, to support new jobs and opportunities. last year, close to $100 billion was dedicated to covid-19 support measures over five budgets, with up to $52 billion drawn from the reserves. ""our circumstances today are very different compared with last year.  and under such a circumstance, i don't think we should be going to the president to seek permission to draw on our past reserves"" said the minister, adding that singapore must expect to run into situations like this from time to time, when restrictions need to be tightened temporarily to control the spread of the virus. ""so we will have to learn to adapt to such situations, using our own resources rather than to dip into our past reserves, and it's on that basis that we are able to set aside some funds for this package,"" said mr wong. rental relief will also be given to small and medium-sized enterprises as well as eligible non-profit organisations in commercial properties, while eligible lower- to middle-income workers and self-employed workers whose income have been affected by the measures can receive a one-off payout of up to $700 under a new covid-19 recovery grant (temporary). under the current covid-19 measures, services such as dining in, facials and saunas are barred from may 16 to june 13, while tighter capacity caps apply to retail spaces such as shopping centres and showrooms.  social gatherings are capped at two people. indoor sports facilities such as gyms, too, face tougher operating restrictions from may 8 to june 13 including having to close, unless they offer only low-intensity activities, where participants are masked and do not share common equipment. some support has been given to businesses and workers to cushion the impact of the measures, but companies have sought more help from landlords and the government. for instance, food and beverage businesses will get 50 per cent wage subsidies under the jss during the period for which dining in is prohibited, up from 10 per cent.  hawkers and coffee shop stallholders who are tenants of government agencies will also get a one-month rental waiver. at least five mall operators have also pledged to help tenants hit by the stricter measures imposed on may 16, including by offering rental rebates. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-05-28,"Policeman accused of bullying elderly woman in Yishun speaks out, OP apologises, Singapore News.","singapore a police officer who was accused of bullying an elderly woman in yishun has spoken out, saying that while the accusations were upsetting at first, he will not stop helping members of the public when duty calls. station inspector jeff lim kok hwee, 45, a deputy team leader at yishun south neighbourhood police centre, shared his side of the story, adding that he is glad that ""the truth is out"". on may 19, the singapore police force refuted allegations circulating online that four police officers, including station insp lim, had told the elderly woman off for not wearing her mask. the social media posts claimed that the officers had abused their authority in dealing with the elderly woman. two days later, the fake news law was invoked by home affairs minister k.  shanmugam, requiring an instagram user as well as the singapore uncensored and the online citizen asia (toc) websites to carry correction notices for their posts on the incident. but after toc doubled down on its claims, the police released two clips of body-worn camera footage on tuesday (may 25), taken from the officers involved in the incident. [embed]https://fb. watch/5mjpvey2za/[/embed][embed]https://fb. watch/5mjqs2v64l/[/embed]the footage showed station insp lim buying the woman a packet of food from a nearby stall and instructing the woman's domestic helper to remind her to wear a mask when she is out. speaking to the media on friday, station insp lim said he was called to the scene on the evening of may 17 after receiving a call from a member of the public about an elderly woman who appeared to be lost and was not wearing a mask. when he arrived with three of his colleagues, he said he tried to make her comfortable by sitting down to chat with her. [[nid:530445]]""through chatting with her, i understood that she was waiting for her friends and i was concerned that she might be hungry, and that's when i offered to buy her food,"" he said. ""she requested two chicken wings with chilli, and that's what i bought for her. ""station insp lim said that after handing the food which he paid for out of his own pocket to the elderly woman, he offered to accompany her home, but she refused. through his interactions with her, he realised that she may have dementia as she did not seem to remember her name or where she lived. a passer-by then informed the officers that the woman lived in a housing board block nearby.  two of station insp lim's colleagues then combed the block to identify the unit where she lives, while station insp lim and one colleague stayed with her. when they found the flat, the police officers asked the woman's domestic helper to go downstairs to fetch her. when the domestic helper arrived at the scene, station insp lim told her to remind the elderly woman to wear a mask when she is out. ""i did not raise my voice,"" he said, refuting allegations made by toc. [[nid:529581]]station insp lim said he did not expect the incident to be twisted to depict him and his colleagues in a negative manner. ""i felt wronged initially.  but this whole incident shouldn't stop us from helping members of the public and in carrying out our duties,"" he said. he also addressed toc's subsequent interviews with the elderly woman, who said the police officers had bullied her. ""i did not take it personally.  i understand that she has dementia and she might not remember what had happened,"" he said. on tuesday, mr shanmugam defended the officers involved, noting that station insp lim is ""an officer with a heart"" who does volunteer work with family service centres in his spare time, and has gone overseas to help when natural disasters struck. in 2015, station insp lim and eight other officers raised $8,000 from friends, family and colleagues to buy daily necessities and clothing for more than 120 families in kathmandu affected by the nepal earthquake. when they returned, they decided to formalise the grouping to continue their efforts to help those in need. today, the group counts 51 police officers as members.  they make monthly contributions to fund food and other necessities to the ang mo kio family service centre and underprivileged people overseas. station insp lim said he hopes the public will not believe everything they see on the internet, but instead try to discern the truth for themselves. ""they (toc) can do what they want, but they should have the responsibility to post something that is factual online,"" he said. on thursday, instagram user @nichology, who originally posted the video of station insp lim and the other officers and accused them of bullying the elderly woman, apologised. ""i am sorry to have jumped to conclusions and for the accusatory tone used on my instagram stories about the police officers,"" he wrote. he added that he accepts responsibility for his actions and the resulting consequences. ""i understand that it was quick and unfair of me to judge so quickly and harshly.  i would definitely be more careful in future,"" he said, adding that he did not have any malicious intent nor did he intend to ""share fake news"". ""while i still believe that citizen journalism is important to provide a community viewpoint, in this case, it also showed that it may cause misjudgments and misunderstandings,"" he said.

India pushes for more studies on origins of COVID-19.","india on may 28 pushed for further studies into the origins of the covid-19 virus, as the world health organisation's decision-making body, the world health assembly, reviewed the findings of its special team. the 120-page report that was submitted by the who on march 31 had listed various hypotheses as possible origins, including the ""lab leak"" theory that it said was ""extremely unlikely"", but concluded that there was need for further research. several countries at the assembly's ongoing annual meeting from may 24-june 1 have raised the need for further studies, but it is unclear whether the body will pass any resolution on the issue. ""the who-convened global study on the origins of covid-19 is an important first step.  it stressed the need for the next phase of studies, as also for further data and studies, to reach robust conclusions,"" said ministry of external affairs (mea) official spokesperson arindam bagchi. ""the follow-up of the who report and further studies deserve the understanding and cooperation of all,"" mr.  bagchi added, in reference to who chief tedros ghebreyesus's earlier statement that accused china of limiting access to its team to conduct studies. speaking at the release of the report, mr.  ghebreyesus had said that he expected ""future collaborative studies to include more timely and comprehensive data sharing"". on april 1, the mea had also issued a lengthy statement on the report, that had listed ""four pathways"" or possible options that led to the pandemic: including a direct zoonotic transmission; the introduction of the virus through another intermediate host or animal; introduction through the cold chain or food chain; and a laboratory incident. the inquiry conducted over four weeks by a joint who-china study team had concluded that the first two theories were ""likely to very likely"", the food chain theory was ""possible"", but the lab incident theory was ""extremely unlikely"". in its statement, india also called for ""a comprehensive and expert-led mechanism"" to investigate the origin of covid-19 in cooperation with all stakeholders, and supported the possibility of an additional who mission to the chinese sites to further study the issue. india's statement comes days after u. s.  health and human services secretary xavier becerra called on the who to conduct a second and more transparent investigation into the origins of the covid-19 at the assembly. u. s.  president joseph biden has also tasked his national security advisor and intelligence agencies to redouble efforts to find a conclusion on the origins of the virus. china, which has consistently denied the theory that there was a leak from a wuhan lab where research on zoonotic transmissions of coronaviruses was taking place, criticised mr.  biden's statement. chinese mfa spokesperson zhao lijian accused the u. s.  of not caring ""about facts and truth. . . or serious scientific origin tracing,"" on thursday, indicating that china considers the ""lab leak"" theory report closed.  our code of editorial valuesplease enter a valid email address.

2021-05-28,"Study: Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccines appear safe, effective.","jakarta, indonesia — two vaccines made by china's sinopharm appear safe and effective against covid-19, according to a study published in a medical journal. scientists had been waiting for more details about the two vaccines, even though they already are being used in many countries, and one recently won the backing of the world health organization for emergency use. the report, published online in the journal of the american medical association, concluded the two vaccines are about 73% and 78% effective, as sinopharm has previously claimed. researchers from sinopharm and its local partners in the middle east say the trial involved around 40,380 participants with the company's two vaccines -- one developed by the wuhan institute of biological products and the other by the beijing institute of biological products — and a placebo.  the trial was carried out in four countries — bahrain, the united arab emirates, egypt and jordan.  however, the study provided data for just bahrain and the uae. ""there's nothing very surprising.  it's consistent with what they have claimed previously, but it does not completely eliminate the doubts about sinopharm,"" said jin dong-yan, a medical professor at the university of hong kong who was not involved with the study. he raised doubts about how protective the vaccine was based on a recent surge of cases in the island nation of seychelles, which had vaccinated a large majority of its population with the sinopharm vaccine. the study, performed mostly in younger men, had little information about the vaccine's effectiveness against severe disease.  some experts also expressed concern at the shortage of female participants, with nearly 85% being male. ""it's important to make sure you have tested it in enough women to be able to start seeing any possible safety concerns,"" said ashley st.  john, an associate professor at duke-nus medical school in singapore. a spokesperson for the company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. the vaccines, both of which are made with inactivated viruses, have already been given to millions of people across the world. the world health organization cleared the beijing institute of biological products' shot for emergency use in early may, making it the first chinese vaccine to receive the certification. chinese foreign minister wang yi said in april that china has provided vaccines to more than 100 countries, although it has not identified them.  while china has six vaccines in use, the majority of its exports come from two companies: sinopharm and sinovac. ___wu reported from taipei, taiwan. ___the associated press health and science department receives support from the howard

2021-05-28,Woman who committed suicide with newborn daughter suffered from postpartum depression: Coroner.,"singapore: a 35-year-old woman who was found dead with her five-week-old daughter at the foot of a block last year had been suffering from postpartum depression and was unable to cope with caring for her baby, a coroner's court has found. in findings made available on friday (may 28), state coroner kamala ponnampalam ruled the woman's death a deliberate suicide and the baby's death as an unlawful killing perpetrated by her mother. the coroner highlighted the ""devastating effects of postpartum depression"" and said it is important for new mothers and those around them to recognise and understand the enormity of stressors faced in such situations. the court heard that the deceased woman was an account executive who was married with two daughters, the second of which was born on sep 20 last year.  the family lived in a flat on the 10th floor of a housing board block. at about 5pm on oct 29 last year, a passer-by at the block heard the sound of bamboo poles breaking followed by two loud thuds.  he turned and saw the woman and the baby on the ground.  he called the police. officers found the deceased woman lying on the ground next to the rubbish chute and the child nearby.  other items found near them include baby shorts, baby socks, a diaper and a pair of broken spectacles. investigations found that the mother and her child had fallen from the kitchen window in their home on the 10th floor.  a stool was found at the same window, which was left wide open. voice recording left to her husbandthere were no signs of struggle in the home and a voice recording addressed to her husband was found on the woman's phone. in the recording, the woman said she should not have had the baby as she did not know how to take care of babies or her family.  she said she was not a good mother and wife and had let the family down. she asked her husband to take good care of their elder daughter and expressed regret that she would not be around to watch her grow up.  she gave her husband the password to her bank account and ended by saying that she has no other way as her mind was not working. two knives were found on top of the toilet cistern in the master bedroom bathroom, with several bloodstains on the cistern and on one of the blades.  the dna on the bloodstains matched the woman's. both mother and baby were certified to have died from multiple injuries consistent with a fall from height. medical reportsmedical reports indicated that the woman had gone to gleneagles hospital on sep 20, 2020, to induce labour.  she was diagnosed with maternal distress during labour and delivery and had an assisted vaginal delivery. she was discharged well three days later with no obstetrical complication other than gestational diabetes.  there was no symptom of postnatal depression and the woman did not mention any suicidal ideation. the woman's husband said they had their first child in 2016 and all was well then.  his wife was healthy post-delivery in 2020, he said. what she told her husbandduring the first month after the baby was born, a confinement nanny cared for the mother and child.  about five days after the nanny left, the woman told her husband that she was stressed over having to take care of two children. she said she had forgotten how to take care of children, and her husband reassured her, saying his mother would care for their elder daughter during the day.  he told his wife that she did not have to do anything except rest and take care of the infant. during her pregnancy, the woman had told her husband that she wanted to quit her job as she was feeling stressed.  he told her that it was normal to feel stressed at work and that she should be thankful to have a job during the covid-19 period. after the birth, the woman again said she wanted to quit her job, but her husband told her to rest during her maternity leave and not think about work.  she did not speak about quitting her job again and her husband thought that everything was alright, the court heard. on oct 29, 2020, the day began as usual according to the woman's husband, and he left for work at about 7am without noticing anything unusual about his wife.  he only found out what happened when the police called him. accounts from the woman's friendsthe deceased woman's colleague said she had not complained of any difficulties in caring for her first child. on the day of the woman's death, the colleague sent her a text message asking if she was well.  the woman replied that she was not feeling very good and she did not know how to take care of babies anymore. she added that she did not know what her baby wanted, or why she was crying and could not sleep.  her colleague suspected that she could be suffering from postnatal depression and advised her to get help and employ a maid. the woman replied that she was not inclined to spend money to hire a domestic helper, and did not express any intention to end her life. her childhood friend also testified in the coroner's inquiry, saying that she did not notice anything unusual when she visited the family at their home. she later heard that the deceased was feeling depressed, and when she asked her friend about it, the latter said she did not know how to take care of babies anymore. a day before the suicide, the friend visited the deceased, who told her that her baby would cry whenever her elder daughter cried.  the deceased said she did not know how to make her children stop crying, and her friend consoled her that it is normal for babies to cry and gave her some advice on how to care for infants. she suggested that the woman employ a maid, and observed that the deceased did not seem to have much appetite and did not sleep well.  she appeared depressed and kept repeating that she was lost and did not know how to care for her baby. police investigations found that the deceased was having difficulties in caring for the baby when she no longer had a nanny to assist her. her friends suspected she was suffering from postnatal depression and suggested that she employ a maid, but she was concerned about the cost.  she also appeared anxious about coping with work after her maternity leave, and although her husband reassured her and made alternative care arrangements for their older child, the woman's concerns and anxiety persisted. recognise postpartum depression: coronerthe coroner said the woman's death is ""yet another stark reminder of the devastating effects of postpartum depression"". ""in acute cases such as (hers), thoughts of self-harm seem almost inevitable,"" she said. ""the pressures from caring for a newborn can be immense.  coupled with the demands from managing the household and family while getting ready to return to work, may all seem insurmountable. ""she said it is important for new mothers as well as their spouses, family and friends to recognise and understand the enormity of the stressors. ""often, they may not resolve on their own without the appropriate help, changes or adjustments, and medical therapy if required,"" said the coroner. ""most of all, a good support network and genuine encouragement from family and friends is essential to help the new mum cope. ""she gave her condolences to the family of the woman and her child for their loss. where to get help:samaritans of singapore hotline: 1800 221 4444institute of mental health's helpline: 6389 2222singapore association of mental health helpline: 1800 283 7019you can also find a list of international helplineshere.  if someone you know is at immediate risk, call 24-hour emergency medical services. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-05-28,What we know about the origins of COVID-19.,"london: scientists are revisiting a central mystery of covid-19: where, when and how did the virus that causes the disease originate?the two prevailing competing theories are that the virus jumped from animals, possibly originating with bats, to humans, or that it escaped from a virology laboratory in wuhan, china.  the following is what is known about the virus' origins. why is the lab in wuhan a focus of interest?the wuhan institute of virology (wiv) is a high-security research facility that studies pathogens in nature with the potential to infect humans with deadly and exotic new diseases. the lab has done extensive work on bat-borne viruses since the 2002 sars-cov-1 international outbreak, which began in china, killing 774 people worldwide.  the search for its origins led years later to discovery of sars-like viruses in a southwest china bat cave. the institute collects genetic material from wildlife for experimentation at its wuhan lab.  researchers experiment with live viruses in animals to gauge human susceptibility.  to reduce the risk of pathogens escaping accidentally, the facility is supposed to enforce rigorous safety protocols, such as protective garb and super air filtration.  but even the strictest measures cannot eliminate such risks. why do some scientists suspect a laboratory accident?to some scientists, the release of a dangerous pathogen via a careless lab worker is a plausible hypothesis for how the pandemic started and warrants investigation. the wuhan lab, china's leading sars research facility, is not far from the huanan seafood market, which early in the health crisis was cited as the most likely place where animal-to-human transmission of the virus may have taken place.  the market was also the site of the first known covid-19 superspreader event. their proximity raised immediate suspicions, fuelled by the failure so far to identify any wildlife infected with the same viral lineage and compounded by the chinese government's refusal to allow the lab-leak scenario to be fully investigated. scientists and others have developed hypotheses based on general concerns about the risks involved in live virus lab research, clues in the virus' genome, and information from studies by institute researchers. although the wuhan lab's scientists have said they had no trace of sars-cov-2 in their inventory at the time, 24 researchers sent a letter to the world health organization (who) urging a rigorous, independent investigation.  the who's first such mission to china this year failed to probe deeply enough, they wrote. a us state department fact sheet, released before the who mission in the waning days of the trump administration, alleged, without proof, that several wiv researchers had fallen sick with symptoms consistent with covid-19 or common seasonal illnesses before the first publicly confirmed case in december 2019. a may 5, story by nicholas wade in the bulletin of the atomic scientists, said lab scientists experimenting on a virus sometimes insert a sequence called a ""furin cleavage site"" into its genome in a manner that makes the virus more infectious.  david baltimore, a nobel prize-winning virologist quoted in the article, said when he spotted the sequence in the sars-cov-2 genome, he felt he had found the smoking gun for the origin of the virus. what are the arguments for animal-to-human transmission?many scientists believe a natural origin is more likely and have seen no scientific evidence to support the lab leak theory.  kristian g andersen, a scientist at scripps research who has done extensive work on coronaviruses, ebola and other pathogens transmissible from animals to humans, said similar genomic sequences occur naturally in coronaviruses and are unlikely to be manipulated in the way baltimore described for experimentation. scientists who favour the natural origins hypothesis have relied largely on history.  some of the most lethal new diseases of the past century have been traced to human interactions with wildlife and domestic animals, including the first sars epidemic (bats), mers-cov (camels), ebola (bats or non-human primates) and nipah virus (bats). while an animal source has not been identified so far, swabs of stalls in the wildlife section of the wildlife market in wuhan after the outbreak tested positive, suggesting an infected animal or human handler. has new information emerged to lend credence to one theory over another?the scientists' mar 4 letter to the who refocused attention on the lab-leak scenario, but offered no new evidence.  nor has definitive proof of a natural origin surfaced. us president joe biden on may 26 said his national security staffdoes not believe there is sufficient informationto assess one theory to be more likely than the other.  he instructed intelligence officials to collect and analyse information that could close in on definitive conclusion andreport back in 90 days. downloadour appor subscribe to our telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:https://cna. asia/telegramit looks like the

market was also the site of the first known covid-19 superspreader event.', ""their proximity raised immediate suspicions, fuelled by the failure so far to identify any wildlife infected with the same

""if we turn on all the firepower for vaccination, the coverage for the first shot could reach 60 per cent,"" health minister chen shih-chung told a daily news briefing. the authorities will use a combination of imported and home-made vaccines to reach that fraction of a population of more than 23 million by the end of october, he said, adding that even coverage of 40 per cent would be effective to curb the outbreak. taiwan has received fewer than one million doses of nearly 30 million on order, as global supply shortages constrict vaccine deliveries.  it has also blamed china for blocking a deal for vaccines from germany's biontech. with just about 1 per cent of its population vaccinated, taiwan is seeking urgent help from allies, such as the united states, to secure vaccines as domestic criticism mounts over the shortfall. after pressure from some opposition politicians, dr chen said local governments and companies would be able to import vaccines directly, but have to follow strict protocols, including doing it through pharmaceutical companies. the charity of billionaire terry gou, founder of apple inc supplier foxconn, said it was preparing to apply for permission to be able to import vaccines, but called on the government to provide clarity on the rules. positive covid-19 cases are currently heavily concentrated in the capital, taipei, and its neighbouring city. dr chen said current curbs, such as limits on gatherings, were effective, but the rise in new infections remained high. ""this is not a very good situation. . .  we are not seeing a downward trend,"" he said, referring to daily new infections that have hovered above 400 in the past week. ""there are hidden patients in the community,"" he added.  ""we need to speed up rapid tests in hot spots.

2021-05-28,Shares in Hong Kong democracy paper quadruple as suspension ends.,"apple daily is hong kong's most popular tabloid and a staunch supporter of the city's pro-democracy movement (source: afp)shares in the parent company of hong kong's pro-democracy apple daily newspaper quadrupled on thursday as trading in them resumed following an eight day suspension. dealing in next digital was halted last week after city authorities said they were freezing the assets of its jailed owner jimmy lai, using a sweeping new national security law. but when trading resumed thursday the share price skyrocketed from its previous close of hk$0. 19 to hit hk$0. 80 before paring the gains to hk$0. 36 mid-morning. the group saw a similar — and volatile — surge in its share price in august when police first arrested lai, as ordinary hong kongers snapped up the firm to show support for the embattled apple daily. the 73-year-old media tycoon has long been a thorn in beijing's side for his caustic newspaper and unapologetic support for democracy. apple daily, the city's most popular tabloid, has staunchly backed hong kong's pro-democracy cause, including the huge and often violent protests that swept the international financial hub in 2019. in a filing on wednesday announcing its plan to start trading again the following day, next digital said some hk$500 million (us$65 million) of lai's assets had been frozen, including his 71 percent stake in the company. the freeze did not extend to next digital itself or its subsidiaries, the company said. it was the first time hong kong authorities have used the national security law to freeze shares of a listed company's majority shareholder — a step that could cause further jitters for investor sentiment in the city. next digital said its unaudited bank and cash balances were approximately hk$521. 4 million at the end of march. ""existing working capital of the group will remain sufficient for at least 18 months from april 1 2021 without additional funding from mr lai,"" the filing said. the asset freeze comes as chinese authorities roll out a relentless and successful campaign to silence dissent in hong kong. lai is currently serving a 14-month jail sentence for taking part in two of the 2019 protests. he is also charged with ""colluding with foreign forces"" — one of the new national security crimes — for allegedly advocating for foreign sanctions. more than 100 people — including some of the city's most prominent democracy activists — have been arrested under the law. most of those charged are refused bail and those who are convicted face up to life in jail. — afp © 2006 2021 the online citizen© 2006

2021-05-28,Police investigating online poll sexualising female religious teachers.,"singapore: an online poll sexualising female muslim religious teachers is being investigated by the police as singapore leaders condemned the poll. president halimah yacob and minister-in-charge of muslim affairs masagos zulkifli are among those who called on the authorities to investigate the poll ranking female asatizah (religious leaders). in response to cna's queries, the singapore police force said on thursday (may 27) that they have received a report about the poll and investigations are ongoing. in a facebook post, mdm halimah said: ""is there no limit to how low some will stoop to degrade and defile women? not only those who conducted the poll but those who participated in it also deserves our strongest condemnation. ""muis (islamic religious council of singapore) and the police should fully investigate this and punish those found guilty.  this is not just the worst kind of harassment that's against our law but amounts to an open invitation to commit sexual violence against women. ""we must not allow the anonymity of the web to embolden those who wish to abuse, denigrate and violate women. ""addressing allegations online that among those who participated in the poll were people studying to become religious teachers, mdm halimah said the community has to ""seriously consider whether they are fit to preach in the community once they complete their studies"". in response to media queries, muis described the poll as ""demeaning and insulting the modesty of some female religious teachers"", and said that it has caused immense distress to those named. ""muis is very concerned by this.  we have reached out to speak to the victims of the post and will be providing support and counselling to help them through this traumatic time,"" the council said, adding that it filed a police report. muis said it will not tolerate any form of sexual harassment, describing such behaviour as ""an abomination in our religion"" and ""a disgrace to the muslim community"". ""our faith calls for mutual respect at all times, and emphasises with utmost importance, the need to safeguard the honour and modesty of all members of society,"" the council added. in a facebook post, mr masagos said he has urged the authorities to investigate the matter ""expediently"". ""the irresponsible people or parties behind this abhorrent poll must be held accountable with the full force of the law,"" he added. he also addressed the claims that those behind the poll are islamic studies undergraduates. ​​​​​​​""if the allegations are indeed true, these perpetrators must be dealt with to the full extent of the law for demonstrating such deplorable behaviour,"" said mr masagos, who is also minister for social and family development. ""all of us have a part to play in calling out and purging such misogynistic attitudes from our society.  i am heartened that many have already spoken out against this appalling incident.  but we must deal with it as a civil society by the rule of law.  we must continue to be a society that honours our women, instead of denigrating them. """"must be held accountable""the issue came to light after ustaz muhammad zahid mohd zin, a popular local religious teacher, said on his instagram account on wednesday (may 26) that he was shocked when he received a ""distress call"" from a female religious teacher about the poll. accompanying the post was a picture of the poll ranking at least 12 women, with their names and faces censored. ""who did this must be held accountable,"" ustaz zahid wrote. one female religious teacher, ustazah fatin afika, shared on her instagram account that some of the images shared in the group were from ""islamic related videos"". the incident also drew condemnation from the singapore islamic scholars and religious teachers association (pergas), which said that all ""sexual harassment, abuse and objectification"" was haram, or religiously forbidden. in a video on social media, pergas acting chief executive dr mohamed qusairy thaha said it was pursuing the matter and intended to ""provide as much assistance as possible"" to victims. mp zhulkarnain abdul rahim (pap-chua chu kang) wrote in a facebook post that he was ""appalled, disgusted and disappointed"" at the poll. ""in my years as a lawyer and volunteer with casa raudha women home, i find that beneath physical or sexual violence lies patriarchal or misogynistic mindset that needs to be eradicated,"" he added. in a facebook post, the association of women for action and research (aware) said it was ""troubled by the demeaning and misogynistic social media poll"" about the female religious leaders. beyond the hijab, a website focusing on the experiences of muslim women in singapore, said on its twitter account: ""this shows how the issue of sexual harassment and violence in essence has never been about whether women are 'modest' enough, it is about a patriarchal culture that routinely dehumanises and reduces women with little consequence for the perpetrators.

land them in prison for up to seven years.  when asked whether his move would undermine the reputation of the city as a global financial hub, john lee ka-chiu said on thursday he was following the national security law laid down by beijing last summer that banned acts of subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces.  ""i am exercising the power because lai has been charged with two offences of collusion with other countries or external forces to endanger national security,"" he said.

""will the bank call the loans? will suppliers continue to offer credit terms?"" he said on his facebook page.  noting the statement was issued by the board, leung questioned why it had not made its own assessment during the trading suspension, rather than relying on the management's.  ex-hong kong leader has government on the defensive.  is he planning a comeback? ""who is the person in charge of the management? this is the chief executive officer.  and who is the chief executive officer? he is cheung kim-hung,"" he wrote.  the former leader – who is also a vice-chairman of china's top political advisory body – had already lashed out at cheung before next digital's announcement, revealing on wednesday that he had appointed a lawyer to file a formal complaint with law enforcement against the ceo for making ""negligent, irresponsible and intentionally misleading"" remarks.  leung disputed cheung's suggestion the company's operations and finances would not be affected by the freezing of lai's assets, and demanded a thorough investigation by authorities.  asked about the criticisms, cheung declined to comment.  additional reporting by jeffie lammore from south china morning post:hong kong authorities freeze nearly hk$500 million in assets belonging to media tycoon jimmy laifuture of hong kong's apple daily is on the line after founder jimmy lai's assets are frozen under national security lawthis article national security law: jimmy lai's hong kong bankers warned that handling assets could land them in jail first appeared on south china morning postfor the latest news from the south china morning post download our mobile app.  copyright 2021. the trial of an australian academic detained for more than two years in china on espionage charges began behind closed doors on thursday, with canberra voicing deep concerns over a lack of transparency after its ambassador was denied access. australia closed its embassy in afghanistan on friday, highlighting security fears for foreign missions and their local workers as us-led troops pull out of the war-torn country.

2021-05-28,"Netizens scold gov't for not being ""proactive"" with regards to pre-departure testing for citizens and PRs.","as of saturday (29 may), singaporeans and permanent residents (prs) will be required to present a negative covid-19 polymerase chain reaction (pcr) test before returning or transiting through singapore. the ministry of health (moh) announced this tightening of border measures on wednesday (26 may) as the country ramps up measures to curb the risk of imported cases of the virus. the new measures would require all travellers to present a negative pcr test taken within 72 hours of their departure to singapore before they are even allowed to board a flight or ferry. upon arrival, they will have to present their results before taking another pcrt test and serving a 21-day stay-home notice (shn). however, citizens and prs who live in countries deemed as ""lower risk"" for 21-days before their departure are exempted from this new measure.  those countries include australia, brunei, mainland china, hong kong, macau and new zealand. citizens and prs travelling from these countries will have to either take an on-arrival pcr test without serving shn, or serve a seven-day shn at their residence before taking the test after the seven days. before this, the requirement was placed on long-term pass holders and short term visitors entering singapore to present a negative pcr test pre departure to singapore.  this has been implemented since november 2020. moh had previously said that it did not extend the requirement of a pre-departure test to returning citizens and prs as it did not want to make it difficult for them to return home if they are taken caught by a quickly deteriorating condition overseas. in its statement yesterday, moh said: ""we have put in place advisories on overseas travel for some time now, and singapore citizens and prs abroad would have had more time to manage the risks of covid-19 in the countries that they are in. ""from saturday, any travellers arriving in singapore without a valid negative pcr test done pre-departure may be denied entry, said the ministry, adding that prs and long-term pass holders who fail to comply may have their permits or pass cancelled. the public reaction to this announcement has been one of surprise, especially the revelation that citizens and prs have not been required to take a pre-departure test all this while.  many were irked at the government's slow and reactive response to the situation, calling them shortsighted and pointing out how other countries had made pre-departure testing a requirement a long time ago. netizens chided that this should have been a requirement much earlier especially when the number of imported cases were on the rise. one person chided the government for never being proactive in its handling of the pandemic. others lamented that this new requirement is ""too little, too late"".  © 2006 2021 the online citizen© 2006 2021 the

2021-05-28,"'Heavy retribution': Driver of Maserati that dragged cop, with new lawyers, loses appeal, Singapore News.","singapore the driver of a maserati that dragged a police officer for more than 100m as he fled had his appeal against his conviction and sentence dismissed by the high court on friday (may 28). lee cheng yan was sentenced by a district court last year to four years and seven months' jail for a slew of offences, including voluntarily causing grievous hurt to a traffic police officer.  he was also given a $3,700 fine and a lifetime driving ban. in his appeal on friday, lee, 37, who was represented by new lawyers, abandoned his previous claim that someone else was driving the car at the time. he conceded that he was the driver but argued that he should be convicted of a less serious charge for causing hurt to the officer. justice aedit abdullah was not persuaded that the conviction was in error or that the sentence was manifestly excessive. the judge said lee's conduct was ""heinous and dangerous"" and he had to be punished severely for his offences. [[nid:470363]]""a car is not normally a weapon, but in the context of a traffic stop, causing injury by a car or other vehicle is tantamount to the use of a weapon. . .  using such a vehicle to cause harm should not only attract deterrence but heavy retribution,"" he said. lee was under a driving ban when he was stopped by staff sergeant khairulanwar abd kahar in bedok reservoir road on the night of nov 17, 2017, for not wearing a seat belt. while the officer was standing next to the driver-seat door, lee suddenly reversed the car and then accelerated forward. the officer's uniform got caught in the door and he was dragged by the moving vehicle for 124m before he fell onto the road. lee was pursued by a motorcyclist, whose pillion rider recorded the chase.  the recording shows lee beating two red lights, overtaking other vehicles without any signal and going against the flow of traffic. the most serious charge faced by lee was for voluntarily causing grievous hurt to a public servant, for which he was handed four years' jail. his lawyer, mr jeremy pereira, argued that he should instead be convicted of causing grievous hurt by a rash act and be sentenced to 12 to 15 months' jail. mr pereira argued that lee was acting rashly because as he stepped on the accelerator, he was aware of the possibility that the officer could get hurt but was ""indifferent"". [[nid:463612]]""he took a chance.  he could have been lucky, he could have been unlucky.  as it turned out, he was unlucky,"" said the lawyer. deputy public prosecutor timotheus koh argued that lee's sentence was appropriate, given the audacious circumstances.  he noted that lee knew the officer was being dragged and heard him shouting, but did not stop. ""his actions were fully deliberate and displayed a shocking level of callousness,"" said the prosecutor. lee started serving his jail term on march 17 after he was remanded into custody. that day, 10

2021-05-28,"Amid more Covid-19 cases, is Singapore better or worse off now than last year?, Singapore News.","singapore a fresh wave of covid-19 infections is sweeping the globe, with several countries in the region, including malaysia, indonesia and the philippines getting badly hit. singapore has not been spared. in the fortnight till may 26, it has seen between 19 and 38 new community cases diagnosed each day compared with the one to 16 cases a day in the previous fortnight in spite of tighter safety measures. to some, this evokes memories of the days leading up to the circuit breaker last year, when case numbers were rising. but there are key differences.  singapore may be battling more infectious variants of the virus this time around, but it appears to have a firmer grip on the situation. the number of new community cases is currently lower than the roughly 40-60 in early april last year, just before the circuit breaker was implemented. this is despite the fact that all four of the more easily transmissible variants of concern (vocs) have been found here, with several of the recent clusters caused by the spread of the b1617 variant that is ravaging india. there are about 240 people requiring hospital care today, among whom 18 are on oxygen and two need intensive care. but singapore has so far evaded the fate of countries that faced second waves of infection far more devastating than the first. globally, there are more new daily cases this year than last more than half a million people are infected each day largely due to the high rate of transmission in india.  places like brazil and argentina continue to report high numbers. professor leo yee sin, executive director of the national centre for infectious diseases, said: ""the strain that is prevalent in many of the covid-19 cases (in singapore) in recent weeks is the b16172 variant. ""this has a ""higher amount of virus excreted from respiratory secretion compared with the parent strain"", she added, and ""can amplify in all forms of transmission routes"", such as surfaces, through direct contact, droplet and aerosol transmission. yet experts the straits times spoke to were generally optimistic. dr asok kurup, who chairs the academy of medicine's chapter of infectious disease physicians, said: ""i was initially all for a circuit breaker, but it seems that the daily numbers are pretty stable and manageable. ""[[nid:530056]]professor dale fisher, a senior infectious diseases consultant at the national university hospital (nuh), said: ""the curve is quite flat and, importantly, what we aren't seeing is exponential growth. ""prof fisher said singapore can also take comfort that a third of the population has had at least one dose of the vaccine. he said singapore is ""starting to reap the benefits"" of lower transmissions, since people who have been vaccinated, even with just one dose, are less likely to spread the virus.  and should they get infected, the disease is less severe for them. the hospitals have not been overwhelmed and have been able to cope. prof fisher said that while the mrna vaccines may be less effective against the vocs, the drop in efficacy is only about 5-10 per cent which means ""they are still really good"". associate professor hsu liyang of the nus saw swee hock school of public health feels singapore is in a stronger position than it was last year. ""today, we understand far more about the virus than we did before. . .  we know how to limit its spread and have treatment options backed by clinical trials.  we have safe and effective vaccines. . .  and the capacity to ramp up testing and containment facilities,"" he said. his colleague at the school, associate professor alex cook, fully agreed: ""we hold a strong hand. ""the safe management measures to control spread are generally very effective, adherence is good, testing capacity is high, vaccination roll-out is proceeding apace, the border has been made even more secure. ""[[nid:528648]]he said the major risk is the ""seemingly more transmissible variants"", which is why the safety measures ""are not quite as effective as they were last year"". prof cook added that since the immunity levels among migrant workers is much higher today, ""we are much less likely to see the explosive dorm outbreaks we did a year ago"". last year, covid-19 spread like wildfire among dormitory residents, shooting up very quickly to hit more than 1,000 cases a day by mid-april, putting great stress on the healthcare system. cases in the dormitories still account for more than 90 per cent of all local cases.  singapore also has about 4,600 imported cases, bringing the total number here to close to 62,000. but there have been only a handful of cases among dormitory residents in the past fortnight. and yet, it could be a long time before life returns to normal. countries around the world have been hoping to acquire herd immunity through a population vaccination programme as the answer to the pandemic. the idea is that those who are vaccinated would break the chain of transmission, hence reducing the spread of the disease. the number touted for herd immunity has gone up from getting 50 per cent of the population vaccinated when the pandemic was declared, to 60- 80 per cent today. herd immunity depends on a number of factors. [[nid:527505]]the r0, or transmission rate, is of course important.  at the start of the pandemic, one person was thought to be transmitting the disease to two others so if half the population was immune, the spread would fall to one person infecting just one other.  in other words, the number of infections would remain flat. but the vocs are said to be more easily transmitted.  this means that a larger proportion of the population needs to be immune to spreading the virus. then, the level of protection given by the vaccine, or prior infection, also influences the transmission rate.  the lower the protection rate, the higher the percentage of population that has to be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity. ""i am not sure that herd immunity is a useful concept here,"" said prof fisher.  ""the endpoint will be ongoing transmission where only the unvaccinated get sick. ""   so 'herd immunity' will not protect people who do not have immunity either from a previous infection or through vaccination. even with herd immunity, people will get infected, though the country will not see an explosion of cases. professor ooi eng eong, of the duke-nus medical school's emerging infectious diseases programme, said: ""i don't think we will get rid of covid-19, but the number of cases would not overwhelm our healthcare system to result in excessive number of covid-19-related deaths. ""but he is optimistic that vaccines will restore most of what life was before 2020, though he added: ""we will, however, have to develop an active surveillance system for covid-19 cases even when vaccinated, to be proactive in dealing with potential vaccine-escape mutants if they do arise. ""prof fisher agreed that once people here are vaccinated, covid-19 can be treated as a mild disease.  this could even happen by the end of this year, he said. ""that's what the vaccine does reduces transmission and makes the disease mild.  we could remove quarantine as an entry requirement to singapore but it does require a very high vaccine uptake here. ""quarantine may still be required for visitors coming from places with high infection rates. however, dr kurup said: ""no i don't see this yet as we have not even climbed the peak. ""he said travel will only be possible when large numbers of people everywhere get vaccinated, and this is difficult to achieve with inequitable access. prof cook too said that carefree travel may be some way off, given the delays in getting vaccines to low- and middle-income countries. [[nid:528667]]""but opportunities for some forms of travel may become more possible once vaccination rates have expanded sufficiently. ""so while everyone here might chafe at the current restrictions on movement and socialising, there appears to be a light at the end of tunnel for those who are vaccinated. unfortunately, some people, because of their age or medical conditions, cannot be vaccinated at least with the current vaccines available. prof leo said while vaccination and contact tracing are important tools to prevent or slow down transmission, it is more important that people follow safety measures and see a doctor when sick, since the virus ""is elusive in nature"". rigorous precautions by everyone may be the only way to keep it in check. this article was first published in the straits times.  permission required for reproduction.

last year, just before the circuit breaker was implemented.', 'this is despite the fact that all four of the more easily transmissible variants of concern (vocs) have been found here, with several of the recent clusters caused by the spread of the b1617 variant that is ravaging india.', 'there are about 240 people requiring hospital care today, among whom 18 are on oxygen and two need intensive care.', 'but singapore has so far evaded the fate of countries that faced second waves of infection far more devastating than the first.', 'globally, there are more new daily cases this year than last more than half a million people are infected each day largely due to the high rate of transmission in india.', 'places like brazil and argentina continue to report high numbers.', 'professor leo yee

2021-05-28,Haj deferred for Singapore pilgrims for second year over COVID-19 concerns.,"singapore: the haj plans for muslim pilgrims from singapore has been deferred for the second year in a row due to concerns over the ongoing covid-19 pandemic, the islamic religious council of singapore (muis) announced on thursday (may 27). ""the covid-19 pandemic situation around the world remains dynamic and of significant concern, with the spread of new variants of the virus in recent months,"" said muis in a news release. ""an increasing number of countries around the world are reporting new waves of infections and the coming months likely will remain challenging,"" it added, noting that the singapore government's advisory to defer travel except for certain essential and compassionate reasons remains in force. in light of this, muis has decided not to send a haj delegation to the kingdom of saudi arabia this year. the council added that this decision is supported by the fatwa committee, which is chaired by mufti dr naziruddin nasir, in consideration of the health and safety of pilgrims. in a typical year, more than two million muslims perform the annual haj pilgrimage to mecca one of the five pillars of islam with singapore allowed 900 pilgrims each year since 2018. the haj was also deferred last year for singapore pilgrims due to the covid-19 pandemic. muis said it will facilitate the re-allocation of haj places for the affected pilgrims to next year, though it noted their eligibility to perform the haj then will be subject to any requirements mandated by the relevant authorities in saudi arabia as well as the prevailing covid-19 situation. last month, saudi authorities said only those immunised against the coronavirus will beallowed to perform the umrah, a pilgrimage that can be performed at any time of the year. in its release, muis said it has ""full confidence"" in saudi arabia's management of the pandemic and that ""appropriate measures"" will be put into place should the haj be allowed to proceed this year. ""however, singapore has its own considerations to safeguard the health and well-being of singaporean pilgrims,"" it said. no official decision yet on international pilgrimsmuis noted that as of tuesday, saudi arabia had not announced an official decision on this year's haj and that it is still unclear whether the annual pilgrimage will be open to international pilgrims, including those from singapore. it noted that this is only one month before zulkaedah 17 in the islamic calendar which this year coincides with jun 28 when flights typically depart from singapore for the haj. ""haj is a complex operation and adequate planning is needed to ensure pilgrims' health and well-being, including assembling and training a medical team to provide medical support to pilgrims,"" muis said. ""additionally, there are many unforeseen circumstances that could happen during this unprecedented period that will compromise pilgrims' health and well-being. ""the council said indications suggest that even if the haj is open to international pilgrims, they will be subject to considerations such as age, their vaccination status, covid-19 testing as well as quarantine requirements in both saudi arabia and singapore. ""these additional restrictions will require significantly much longer travel duration, and also result in significantly higher haj package prices and affect the pilgrims' preparations for haj,"" it said. ""given the evolving nature of the covid-19 virus, as well as the emergence of new, more contagious variants, there is still a risk to the health and safety of the pilgrims despite the good control measures that (saudi arabia) will put in place,"" said muis, noting there could be factors beyond the control of saudi authorities despite their best efforts to ensure the safety of pilgrims. the council's decision is also supported by the association of muslim travel agents (amtas) and haj travel agencies, who have agreed on the importance of protecting the community and minimising the potential spread of the virus. amtas and the haj travel agencies have also agreed that the deposits paid by pilgrims last year which had been carried over for them to perform the pilgrimage this year should now be refunded, the release said. muis is working with saudi authorities to facilitate the refund of deposits, and pilgrims will be contacted by their respective travel agencies within the next two weeks regarding their refunds. muis said it hoped that this decision will help ease the anxieties of the affected pilgrims and families, and allay singapore pilgrims' concern on the uncertainty and the financial risks involved in performing the haj this year. ""this decision will also safeguard the health and well-being of our singaporean pilgrims and the community at large from the risk of covid-19 transmission,"" it added. downloadour appor subscribe to our telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:https://cna. asia/telegramit looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

from singapore has been deferred for the second year in a row due to concerns over the ongoing covid-19 pandemic, the islamic religious council of singapore (muis) announced on thursday (may 27).', '""the covid-19 pandemic situation around the world remains dynamic and of significant concern, with the spread of new variants of the virus in recent months,"" said muis in a news release.', '""an increasing number of countries around the world are reporting new waves of infections and the coming months likely will remain challenging,"" it added, noting that the singapore government\'s advisory to defer travel except for certain essential and compassionate reasons remains in force.', 'in light of this, muis has decided not to send a haj delegation to the kingdom of saudi arabia this year.', 'the council added that this decision is supported by the fatwa committee, which is chaired by mufti dr naziruddin nasir, in consideration of the health and safety of pilgrims.', 'in a typical year, more than two million muslims perform the annual haj pilgrimage to mecca one of the five pillars of islam with singapore allowed 900 pilgrims each year since 2018. the haj was also deferred last year for singapore pilgrims due to the covid-19 pandemic.', 'muis said it will facilitate the re-allocation of haj places for the affected pilgrims to next year, though it noted their eligibility to perform the haj then will be subject to any requirements mandated by the relevant authorities in saudi arabia as well as the prevailing covid-19 situation.', 'last month, saudi authorities said only those immunised against the coronavirus will beallowed to perform the umrah, a pilgrimage that can be performed at any time of the year.', 'in its release, muis said it has ""full confidence"" in saudi arabia\'s management of the pandemic and that ""appropriate measures"" will be put into place should the haj be allowed to proceed this year.', '""however, singapore has its own considerations to safeguard the health and well-being of singaporean pilgrims,"" it said.', ""no official decision yet on international pilgrimsmuis noted that as of tuesday, saudi arabia had not announced an official decision on this year's haj and that it is still unclear whether the annual pilgrimage will be open to international pilgrims, including those from singapore."", 'it noted that this is only one month before zulkaedah 17 in the islamic calendar which this year coincides with jun 28 when flights typically depart from singapore for the haj.', '""haj is a complex operation and adequate planning is needed to ensure pilgrims\' health and well-being, including assembling and training a medical team to provide medical support to pilgrims,"" muis said.', '""additionally, there are many unforeseen circumstances that could happen during this unprecedented period that will compromise pilgrims\' health and well-being.', '""the council said indications suggest that even if the haj is open to international pilgrims, they will be subject to considerations such as age, their vaccination status, covid-19 testing as well as quarantine requirements in both saudi arabia and singapore.', '""these additional restrictions will require significantly much longer travel duration, and also result in significantly higher haj package prices and affect the pilgrims\' preparations for haj,"" it said.', '""given the evolving nature of the covid-19 virus, as well as the emergence of new, more contagious variants, there is still a risk to the health and safety of the pilgrims despite the good control measures that (saudi arabia) will put in place,"" said muis, noting there could be factors beyond the control of saudi authorities despite their best efforts to ensure the safety of pilgrims.', ""the council's decision is also supported by the association of muslim travel agents (amtas) and haj travel agencies, who have agreed on the importance of protecting the community and minimising the potential spread of the virus."", 'amtas and the haj travel agencies have also agreed that the deposits paid by pilgrims last year which had been carried over for them to perform the pilgrimage this year should now be refunded, the release said.', 'muis is working with saudi authorities to facilitate the refund of deposits, and pilgrims will be contacted by their respective travel agencies within the next two weeks regarding their refunds.', ""muis said it hoped that this decision will help ease the anxieties of the affected pilgrims and families, and allay singapore pilgrims' concern on the uncertainty and the financial risks involved in performing the haj this year."", '""this decision will also safeguard the health and well-being of our singaporean pilgrims and the community at large from the risk of covid-19 transmission,"" it added.', 'downloadour appor subscribe to our telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:https://cna.',

[[nid:524355]]the attack left him with multiple injuries, including a fracture in his left hand and swelling in his left ankle.  he had to be hospitalised for 27 days. sim's previous conviction involved another roommate at a different home. the court heard that in may 2017, sim was sentenced to 18 months' jail for splashing hot water on his roommate and slashing him with a knife. dpp ling noted the similarity in the cases and urged the court for a higher sentence than before. sim, who was unrepresented, promised not to fight with others in the future and said that he wished to return to the shelter home. for voluntarily causing hurt, sim could have been jailed for up to three years, fined up to $5,000, or both. this article was first published in the straits times.  permission required for reproduction.

""now we have the database and the records of tenants themselves, and rather than do it through landlords and pass it down, given that we have the information, we might as well provide more directly to tenants and occupiers of these properties. ""the scheme is part of an $800 million support package that includes enhanced wage subsidies under the jobs support scheme (jss). the fair tenancy framework industry committee welcomed the latest measures, saying they will go far in helping businesses weather this difficult period, and in sustaining jobs. the committee comprises key business federations including the association of small medium enterprises; the restaurant association of singapore; the singapore retailers association; and singapore tenants united for fairness.  it said in a statement on friday: ""the announced enhanced measures are carefully crafted, and places targeted help where help is needed.  it will aid businesses substantially in their manpower and rental costs components. ""it will also ensure that we can continue to maintain vibrant food and beverage, retail and service sectors and support those who are employed in these sectors. ""at the press conference on friday,  mr wong praised landlords which have already provided rental support to tenants. ""i'm glad that key landlords like capitaland and cdl (city developments) have already put out statements, even prior to today's announcements, to assure their tenants that they will provide additional support, and i would urge all landlords to do so,"" he said. he also noted the ""positive attitude and mindset"" among businesses he has engaged with. citing the singapore business federation, under which landlords and tenants have come together to develop a code of conduct for the leasing of retail premises, he said key landlord and tenant association groups have pledged to support the code. ""i think initiatives like this are a step in the right direction. ""the measures announced on friday also include one-month rental waivers to smes and npos which are tenants of government-owned commercial properties. some support has already been given to businesses to cushion the impact of the tightened restrictions currently in place. for instance, food and beverage businesses will get 50 per cent wage subsidies under the jss during the period for which dining in is prohibited, up from 10 per cent. hawkers and coffee shop stallholders who are tenants of government agencies will also get a one-month rental waiver. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

""we suspended all on-site services and activities thereafter.  all church staff, except for essential personnel, have been instructed to work from home since then,"" she said. the church is also providing emotional support for the pastor as she recovers in hospital. grace assembly of god church was one of the first covid-19 clusters to emerge last year, with 23 confirmed cases including the church's senior pastor, the reverend wilson teo. in february last year, moh said the primary case in the grace assembly of god cluster was a singaporean, 28, who worked at the church. on jan 25, he attended the same chinese new year gathering as a married couple from the life church and missions.  the married couple had visited the life church and missions on jan 19, the same day that a pair of chinese nationals from wuhan, who tested positive for covid-19 , were at the church. according to the straits times, the two grace house kindergartens at the church's premises will remain open as the pastor had no contact with the schools. arrangements are also being made for the kindergartens they are not operated by the church to be cleaned and disinfected. while on-site services have been put on hold, the church spokesman said the work goes on. ""as a church, we are pivoting and adapting to new ways of providing our congregants with the needed pastoral care and discipleship, especially when we can no longer meet physically the way we used to.

 singapore president halimah yacob and minister in-charge of muslim affairs masagos zulkifli have expressed concern about an online poll sexualising female muslim religious teachers, which is being investigated by police, the local media reported on friday. in a facebook post, the president, in a rare pubic outburst, said, ""is there no limit to how low some will stoop to degrade and defile women? not only those who conducted the (online) poll but those who participated in it also deserve our strongest condemnation. ""muis (islamic religious council of singapore) and the police should fully investigate this and punish those found guilty.  this is not just the worst kind of harassment that is against our law but amounts to an open invitation to commit sexual violence against women. ""we must not allow the anonymity of the web to embolden those who wish to abuse, denigrate and violate women,"" she said. addressing allegations online that among those who participated in the poll were people studying to become religious teachers, halimah said the community has to ""seriously consider whether they are fit to preach in the community once they complete their studies"". the singapore police force on thursday said it has received a report about the poll and investigations are ongoing. in response to media queries, muis described the poll as ""demeaning and insulting the modesty of some female religious teachers"".  it has caused immense distress to those named, said the state-run authority on muslim affairs. ""muis is very concerned by this.  we have reached out to speak to the victims of the post and will be providing support and counselling to help them through this traumatic time,"" a television channel quoted the council as saying. muis said it will not tolerate any form of sexual harassment, describing such behaviour as ""an abomination in our religion"" and ""a disgrace to the muslim community"". ""our faith calls for mutual respect at all times and emphasises with utmost importance the need to safeguard the honour and modesty of all members of the society,"" the council added. in a facebook post, masagos urged the authorities to investigate the matter ""expediently"". ""the irresponsible people or parties behind this abhorrent poll must be held accountable with the full force of the law,"" the channel quoted masagos as saying. he also addressed the claims that those behind the poll are islamic studies undergraduates. ​​​​​​​ ""if the allegations are indeed true, these perpetrators must be dealt with to the full extent of the law for demonstrating such deplorable behaviour,"" said masagos, who is also the minister for social and family development. ""all of us have a part to play in calling out and purging such misogynistic attitudes from our society.  i am heartened that many have already spoken out against this appalling incident.  but we must deal with it as a civil society by the rule of law.  we must continue to be a society that honours our women, instead of denigrating them,"" he said. the issue came to light after ustaz muhammad zahid mohd zin, a popular local religious teacher, said on his instagram account on wednesday that he was shocked when he received a ""distress call"" from a female religious teacher about the poll. accompanying the post was a picture of the poll ranking at least 12 women, with their names and faces censored. ""who did this must be held accountable,"" ustaz zahid wrote. one female religious teacher, ustazah fatin afika, shared on her instagram account that some of the images shared in the group were from ""islamic-related videos"". the incident also drew condemnation from the singapore islamic scholars and religious teachers association (pergas), which said all ""sexual harassment, abuse and objectification"" was ""haram"" (forbidden). in a video on social media, pergas acting chief executive mohamed qusairy thaha said it is pursuing the matter and intends to ""provide as much assistance as possible"" to the victims. in a facebook post, the association of women for action and research (aware) said it was ""troubled by the demeaning and misogynistic social media poll"" about the female religious leaders. beyond the hijab, a website focussing on the experiences of muslim women in singapore, wrote on its twitter handle: ""this shows how the issue of sexual harassment and violence in essence has never been about whether women are 'modest' enough, it is about a patriarchal culture that routinely dehumanises and reduces women with little consequence for the perpetrators. ""we are very disturbed by the fact that the group is allegedly comprised mostly of undergrads of islamic studies and therefore, potential future teachers.  this is not the behaviour that teachers, as people in positions of power, should have.  it would not be safe for students,"" the channel had the site as saying. mulims form the second largest group, led by malay origins, who account for 15 per cent of the 5. 7 million population of multi-national singapore.  the chinese account for 76 per cent, indians 7. 5 per cent and the rest are of others origins.  our code of editorial valuesplease enter a valid email address.

(the victim) then left the scene and reported the matter to his in-charge.  he subsequently went to a toilet in the vicinity to clean himself. ""sulaiman was released on bail the next day and went on a crime spree, including stealing a motorcycle in marine crescent on oct 21. he also broke into a food centre in tai seng avenue near upper paya lebar road two days later. sulaiman was arrested again on oct 24 and officers recovered the stolen motorcycle that same day. on friday, district judge shaiffudin saruwan called for a report to assess sulaiman's suitability for preventive detention.  in preventive detention, a repeat offender aged over 30 receives a substantial period of imprisonment to protect the public. it does not offer the usual one-third remission for good behaviour and the detention order can last up to 20 years. sulaiman will be sentenced on june 18. for using criminal force on a public servant, an offender can be jailed for up to four years and fined. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

""all efforts are being taken to save the vessel and cargo and protect the marine environment, and it appears that the onboard fire has diminished somewhat,"" said a statement from x-press feeders, the singapore-based company that operates the ship. sri lankan officials have lodged a police complaint against the captain of the ship, who was rescued along with other crew members on tuesday. the burning ship is right in front of sri lanka's main port in colombo and is disrupting the maritime shipping lane by blocking the entrance and exit, said sri lanka ports authority chairman daya rathnayake. the navy wants to tow the ship to deeper waters, but rough seas and monsoonal rains are hampering the operation. meanwhile, containers with tonnes of chemicals are already tumbling into the water. ""the ship was carrying chemicals like urea fertiliser, sulphuric acid, nitric acid and ethanol liquid all very toxic.  some fallen containers have reached the coast.  residents from fishing villages who tried to take away some metal pieces have already reported skin allergies,"" said dr dan malika gunasekera, a maritime lawyer in sri lanka, and former executive director of ceylon shipping corporation.

the government has issued warnings for people to keep away from the coast till further notice. ""apart from the toxic fumes in the air, the chemicals are also toxic to marine life.  sri lanka's entire fish production might be at stake this year,"" added dr gunasekera. sri lanka is preparing for escalated damage from a tier ii oil spill, said marine environment protection authority (mepa) chairman dharshani lahandapura.  since the ship is already falling apart, he said it was too late to contain the spilt oil with booms around the vessel. mepa estimates that if the ship sinks, at least a third of the 300 tonnes of bunker fuel oil might discharge in the sea water grease that will take months to clean. the oil threatens to hit the nearby tourist and fishing region of negombo, 40km north of the capital. but a greater worry is debris, especially a profusion of tiny plastic pellets called nurdles, which are used to manufacture large-scale plastic. mr muditha katuwala, coordinator of the pearl protectors, a marine conservation volunteer organisation said these ""shiny white little eggs"" had now spread to other towns along sri lanka's western coastline. ""these microplastic fragments block the airways of sea creatures and fish swallow it, leading to a deterioration of marine life,"" said mr katuwala. 
a greater worry is debris, especially a profusion of tiny plastic pellets called nurdles.  photo: afp
nurdles are challenging to clean, he added, citing the years it took to clean the hundreds of millions of plastic pellets that were dumped on the coast of hong kong's lamma island during a cyclone in 2012. ""mobilising volunteers for beach clean-ups is also impossible until the spilled chemicals are neutralised and covid-19 restrictions lifted,"" said mr katuwala. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

""a poll on local female asatizah (religious teachers). . .  promotes sexual violence or sexual activity involving coercion or non-consent.  such content is unacceptable and has no place in singapore,"" said imda. it added that it has contacted mewe to remove the offending poll if it still remains on the platform.  imda has also spoken to other social media platforms to ensure that the post does not surface on their platforms. minister for communications and information josephine teo said in a facebook post on friday that the poll was ""revolting"", and that she condemned it in the ""strongest terms"". ""whoever is behind this isn't just trying to be funny.  they have designed a deliberate exercise to demean women, and especially women who have dedicated themselves to upholding their faith,"" said mrs teo, who is also chairman of the people's action party's women's wing. the mewe poll was first highlighted by ustaz muhammad zahid mohd zin late on wednesday in an instagram post.  mewe allows users to post comments, start polls, message one another and have group discussions. many netizens, including other asatizah, have since uploaded similar screenshots of the post to criticise it.  the list shows at least 12 asatizah being ranked, with 1,005 participating in the poll. the straits times understands that about 20 to 30 asatizah were ranked in it. the islamic religious council of singapore (muis) said on thursday that it was aware of the post, which had caused ""immense distress"" to the individuals involved, and was very concerned by it. the council has lodged a police report to expedite investigations into the matter and ""bring the perpetrators to justice"". other muslim groups have also spoken out against the poll.  the singapore muslim women's association said on thursday that it stood in solidarity with the women who are affected by the poll, which it called ""deplorable and unacceptable"". the group said that it was shocked at how more than 1,000 people had voted in the poll, and it urged the authorities to investigate the matter thoroughly so that the perpetrators are held accountable and counselled. several netizens have alleged that those who started the poll were students studying to become asatizah, and have urged muis to not accredit them. the singaporean students welfare assembly in egypt told the straits times that it had published a letter on wednesday to show that it does not condone such acts, and that it stands with the people who have been affected. beyond the hijab, a website focusing on the experiences of muslim women in singapore, said on its twitter account: ""we are very disturbed by the fact that the group is allegedly comprised mostly of undergrads of islamic studies and therefore potential future teachers. ""this is not behaviour that teachers, as people in positions of power, should have.  it would not be safe for (their) students. ""mrs teo joins several leaders who have spoken out strongly against the poll on thursday, including president halimah yacob, minister-in-charge of muslim affairs masagos zulkifli and minister in the prime minister's office maliki osman. she added that her ministry will continue to work on protecting women and girls from online harm. ""whether offline or online, respect and safety for women must be the norm.  there should be no question about it,"" she said.  parliamentary secretary for communications and information rahayu mahzam said she deeply appreciated the clear stance from imda that offensive content like the poll has no place in society here.  noting that there is much online harm faced by women and girls that often goes unaddressed, she pointed out that the ministry has been working on a singapore together alliance for action workgroup to discuss, co-create solutions and act against such harm.  ""an overarching theme that surfaced during our discussions is the importance of cultivating a culture of respect for singaporean women both online and offline,"" said ms rahayu.  ""behaviours that perpetuate sexual harassment must be condemned.  i hope singaporeans, both men and women, will work towards a safer and more responsible online culture in singapore and with mutual respect for all.

2021-05-28,Taiwan sees 'political warfare' in dispute with China over vaccines.,"by yimou lee and ben blanchardtaipei (reuters) -taiwan does not believe china is sincere in offering it much needed covid-19 vaccines and thinks it is working to prevent the island from getting shots for political reasons as infections surge, officials briefed on the matter told reuters. china and taiwan have exchanged barbs as the world fights the virus, worsening ties already at a low ebb because of taiwan's refusal to accept chinese sovereignty and stepped up u. s.  support for taipei. the two have embarked on a bitter war of words about vaccines, much needed in taiwan as the medical system comes under strain from new cases with only about 1% of the population of more than 23 million vaccinated. taiwan says china blocked it from getting vaccines produced by germany's biontech, while china says it is happy to send a supply of that vaccine via its chinese sales agent, shanghai fosun pharmaceutical group co ltd. but taiwan will not take the vaccines from fosun, saying there is a lack of transparency and that china refuses to provide relevant information. china's taiwan affairs office, which has repeatedly said its vaccine offer is sincere and taiwan should not put up political roadblocks, said in a statement to reuters that taiwan's allegation it was blocking a biontech deal were ""nonsense"". a senior taiwan official familiar with the situation told reuters that china had not used an existing channel to discuss medical issues, which has been used to exchange information on covid cases, to address the vaccine question. instead, he said, china was launching ""political warfare"" to ""split and weaken"" taiwan, without a real intention to offer the vaccines. ""they are shouting words like they really mean it but they won't give it to you,"" he said. ""there are certain procedures in taiwan to import vaccines, and if their intention is real, they know what to do. ""the government had for months chosen not to publicise what it sees as chinese intervention in the biontech case but had reached a point where it felt it had to, he added. ""vaccines are not politics.  but mainland china knows the best in the world how to politicise vaccines. ""a security official looking into chinese activity in taiwan told reuters that china was ""making a lot of effort"" to prevent taiwan from getting vaccines. ""it's similar to dollar diplomacy.  just that now dollars are replaced by vaccines,"" he added, referring to accusations the two sides exchange over buying diplomatic support with loans and other inducements. china's taiwan affairs office repeated china's stance that taiwan had gone against commercial principles in seeking to bypass fosun. ""they clearly knew they were trying to keep going despite the task being impossible,"" it said. 'liar'taiwan's central epidemic command centre said in a statement to reuters that information about vaccines from fosun in a state media report where the offer was made was ""unclear"" and there was no way to know if the shots complied with taiwan's regulations. fosun has not responded to requests for comment. taiwan's government is also facing pressure at home from the main opposition kuomintang (kmt) party to accept the fosun vaccines. at a news conference on thursday, senior kmt official cheng li-wun called president tsai ing-wen a ""vaccine liar"" and held up a sign saying people would die without vaccines. cheng questioned why the government had refused to purchase vaccines from fosun, saying their shots were ""100%"" biontech vaccines.  ""everyone has purchased goods from a distributor before,"" she said, adding that tsai was stuck on a ""wall of ideology"" and her rejection of china's offer was to save face. adding to taiwan's anger, this week it failed again in its bid to attend the who's decision-making world health assembly as an observer, following objections from beijing and its allies. meanwhile, china's almost daily incursions into the southwestern corner of taiwan's air defence zone have continued. on tuesday, hu xijin, editor of china's influential global times newspaper, said that while there were humanitarianism considerations on vaccines, beijing still had a bottom line. ""military aircraft surrounding taiwan and other pressure will continue,"" he said.

""i am exercising the power because lai has been charged with two offences of collusion with other countries or external forces to endanger national security,"" he said.  ""it is my duty to specify in my notice to the relevant parties what will be the consequences if they fail to comply with my direction.

""will the bank call the loans? will suppliers continue to offer credit terms?"" he said on his facebook page.  noting the statement was issued by the board, leung questioned why it had not made its own assessment during the trading suspension, rather than relying on the management's.  ex-hong kong leader has government on the defensive.  is he planning a comeback? ""who is the person in charge of the management? this is the chief executive officer.  and who is the chief executive officer? he is cheung kim-hung,"" he wrote.  the former leader – who is also a vice-chairman of china's top political advisory body – had already lashed out at cheung before next digital's announcement, revealing on wednesday that he had appointed a lawyer to file a formal complaint with law enforcement against the ceo for making ""negligent, irresponsible and intentionally misleading"" remarks.  leung disputed cheung's suggestion the company's operations and finances would not be affected by the freezing of lai's assets, and demanded a thorough investigation by authorities.  asked about the criticisms, cheung declined to comment.  additional reporting by jeffie lammore from south china morning post:hong kong authorities freeze nearly hk$500 million in assets belonging to media tycoon jimmy laifuture of hong kong's apple daily is on the line after founder jimmy lai's assets are frozen under national security lawthis article national security law: jimmy lai's hong kong bankers warned that handling assets could land them in jail first appeared on south china morning postfor the latest news from the south china morning post download our mobile app.  copyright 2021. !marla40,. $50,. many of the syrian fighters deployed, sometimes forcibly, in foreign conflict theatres such as libya and nagorno-karabakh are robbed of their wages, said a report released thursday. the trial of an australian academic detained for more than two years in china on espionage charges began behind closed doors on thursday, with canberra voicing deep concerns over a lack of transparency after its ambassador was denied access. aye mar sits with her seven children in their yangon kitchen and worries whether their meal of rice and stringy vegetables -- all she can afford in coup-stricken myanmar -- will satisfy their hunger. 51930megag,&3!  kanu,,bt21!8. 5~rafael nadal, novak djokovic and roger federer, the three most successful men in grand slam tennis history, were on thursday all drawn in the same half of the french open. five million weary melbourne residents were put back under lockdown on friday, straining local resolve and testing australia's ""zero-covid"" strategy of smothering outbreaks however small. investors rejected the responses of us oil giants to climate change wednesday, installing activist board members at exxonmobil and directing chevron to deepen emissions cuts.

""there were many students at the bus stop at that time so i thought i would board the bus last.  that way if i got caught, i wouldn't have to make my way through the crowd. . .  when it was my turn to board, i made the beeping sound.  but because i was the last to board, the bus driver caught me in the act,"" she admitted. yingying sheepishly said that she immediately confessed to the driver when she was caught red-handed and pleaded with him to let her take the bus since her house was two stops away. fortunately, the driver was kind enough. influencer xiaxue, 37, was a little more brazen in her deeds. she was around 16 and she working as a banquet waitress who earned somewhere between $5. 50 and $6 per hour.

2021-05-28,Lee Cheng Yan fails in appeal against sentence for dragging police officer with his Maserati.,"singapore: the high court on friday (may 28) dismissed an appeal by a man who wasbanned from driving for life and given jailfor dragging a traffic police officer along the road in an escape bid. lee cheng yan was sentenced in july 2020 to four years and seven months in prison, a fine of s$3,700 and a lifetime driving ban. he had beenconvicted of 10 chargesincluding voluntarily causing grievous hurt to a public servant, failing to stop after an accident and obstructing justice. lee's case gained attention when he advanced a case thathe was not the person behind the wheel, despite evidence to the contrary. he claimed it was a friend he knew only as kelvin, who had a similar build and wore a similar white shirt, who was driving the maserati when the incident occurred in 2017. new lawyers advance new casehowever, lee's newly hired lawyers from withers khattarwong stated during the appeal on friday that they were not pursuing this issue. mr jeremy pereira, who was hired by lee along with his colleague j jayaletchmi, told the court that they were ""not pursuing the matter of whether or not he is the driver"". ""for the purposes of this appeal, we accept the district judge's finding that he is the driver of the vehicle,"" he said. instead, the lawyers argued that lee should not have been convicted of voluntarily causing grievous hurt to deter a public servant of his duty, which carried the bulk of the jail term given to lee. the lawyers said the intention to commit this offence was not sufficiently proven at trial.  instead, he should be convicted of causing grievous hurt by a rash act, which carries a lower maximum jail term. mr pereira said lee was unaware that the police officer's arm was caught in the car, and did not know the officer was in ""any direct position of danger"". lee had defied the officer's instructions to stop and driven off with the officer hanging from the driver's door.  the officer was dragged along the road for 124m at a speed of at least 79kmh and later fell off, suffering injuries to his knee, neck and back. he was given more than 20 days of medical leave and received a medical downgrade in his job. he repeatedly lied under oath: prosecutordeputy public prosecutor timotheus koh called for the appeals to be dismissed, saying that lee repeatedly lied under oath. ""now he's trying to run a case that he was only acting impulsively and was in a state of panic and fear, that he was unaware of the police presence next to the car and (that he was) caught in the car,"" said mr koh. ""the reality is that these (assertions) were never tested in the lower court, and no evidence was led in this regard. ""justice aedit abdullah noted that the new defence lawyers had tried their best despite taking up the case only recently, but said he was not convinced that the convictions were in error. he said lee knew the police officer was next to his vehicle and it was ""strongly inferrable"" that he knew the officer would be hit. ""this is beyond mere rashness,"" he said, adding that those who are stopped by the police should not evade them.  he upheld the original convictions and sentence. lee faces numerous other pending charges, including for driving dangerously after he was banned from driving.  he has been remanded since march this year after being arrested for the traffic offences. he is due back in court next month for a pre-trial conference for the pending charges. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-05-28,Lawrence Wong announces $800m economic support package.,"singapore — the government will spend some $800 million on support measures to assist workers and companies hit by the ongoing phase 2 (heightened alert), said finance minister lawrence wong on friday (28 may).  media reports also cited wong as saying that authorities are unlikely to embark on ""further tightening"" of prevailing measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus as current measures are working.  the multi-ministry taskforce on covid-19, which wong co-chairs, will give a fuller update on monday. the support package will comprise, among others, enhancements to the jobs support scheme (jss) for affected sectors, rental relief for small and medium enterprises (smes) and non-profit organisations (npos) in commercial properties, and the covid-19 recovery grant (temporary) (crg-t). wong said that the government would not need to draw on its past reserves to fund the measures.  he noted that most parts of the economy are still operating, while there are now more government support schemes like the jobs growth incentive. ""we must expect to run into situations like these from time to time, when we experience an occasional outbreak of cases in our community, and we will then need to tighten restrictions temporarily to control the spread of the virus. ""so, we will have to learn to adapt to such situations, using our own resources rather than to dip into our past reserves.  and it is on that basis that we are able to set aside some funds for this package. ""wong, who was speaking at a virtual press conference open only to singapore press holdings and mediacorp outlets, as well as the social news site mothership, added that the support package will be funded by a reallocation of spending.  the minister will table a supplementary supply bill at the next parliamentary sitting in july to effect the reallocation. on 16 may, singapore entered a renewed period of restrictions on social gatherings and other activities, amid a spike in community cases.  the rules, such as a ban on dining-in at all food & beverage (f&b) establishments and lower crowd capacity at public places like malls, are in effect till 13 june.  affected gyms, fitness studios, performing arts organisations, and arts education centres will be given enhanced jss support to the tune of 50 per cent for the period of phase 2.  these are establishments which have been required to suspend many, if not all, of their operations. for sectors that are not required to suspend operations but are significantly affected by the tightened measures, jss support will be enhanced to 30 per cent for the same period.  this covers businesses in the retail sector, affected personal care services, museums, art galleries, historical sites, cinemas, indoor playgrounds and other family entertainment centres.  some retailers like supermarkets, convenience stores and online retailers will not be eligible for the enhanced support. the enhanced payout, based on wages paid from april to june, will be disbursed in september. to support businesses with rental costs, there will be rental relief given to smes, and eligible non-profit organisations (npos) with an annual revenue not exceeding $100 million, who are tenant-occupiers of qualifying commercial properties. qualifying tenants at government-owned commercial properties will be granted a month of rental relief.  this is aligned to the rental waiver for hawker stalls and coffee shops provided during p2(ha).  tenants will be required to pass down the rental relief received to qualifying sub-tenants, if any. and while some landlords at privately-owned commercial properties have given rental waivers or rebates to support their tenants, the inland revenue authority of singapore (iras) will also disburse a 0. 5-month rental relief cash payout directly to qualifying tenants as part of a new rental support scheme.  the payout will be disbursed starting from mid-august 2021 and computed based on the latest contractual gross rent within the period 14-29 may. separately, property owners who run an sme business or npo on their own property will also be eligible for the cash payout, computed based on the annual value of the property (or part of) for year 2021 as at 14 may. to help those in sectors such as f&b, hawkers, retail, arts as well as sports and fitness, the crg-t scheme will provide one-off support for lower- to middle-income employees and self-employed persons who are financially impacted as a result of the tightened measures. individuals who experience at least one month of involuntary no-pay leave (npl) or income loss of at least 50 per cent for at least one month during p2(ha), may apply for crg-t.  eligible individuals placed on involuntary npl may receive a one-off payout of up to $700, and those experiencing significant income loss may receive a one-off payout of up to $500.  applications will open from 3 june to 2 july, with more details to come from the ministry of social and family development. stay in the know on-the-go: join yahoo singapore's telegram channel at

kong's security chief has warned bankers for jailed media tycoon jimmy lai chee-ying that dealing with his frozen accounts could land them in prison for up to seven years.  when asked whether his move would undermine the reputation of the city as a global financial hub, john lee ka-chiu said on thursday he was following the national security law laid down by beijing last summer that banned acts of subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces.  ""i am exercising the power because lai has been charged with two offences of collusion with other countries or external forces to endanger national security,"" he said.  ""it is my duty to specify in my notice to the relevant parties what will be the consequences if they fail to comply with my direction.

""will the bank call the loans? will suppliers continue to offer credit terms?"" he said on his facebook page.  noting the statement was issued by the board, leung questioned why it had not made its own assessment during the trading suspension, rather than relying on the management's.  ex-hong kong leader has government on the defensive.  is he planning a comeback?

2021-05-28,Fight to douse Sri Lanka ship fire could take 'days': Navy chief.,"colombo: an international firefighting effort to put out a huge blaze on a container ship off sri lanka's coast will likely take days, the country's navy chief said on thursday (may 27), amid mounting fears of a major oil leak. nine sri lankan ships and three indian vessels have been working with international salvage experts to douse the eight-day old inferno on the singapore-registered x-press pearl. the vessel was carrying nearly 1,500 containers, including 25 tonnes of nitric acid, when a fire broke out as it waited to enter colombo port. it is believed that the fire was sparked by a leak of nitric acid on the 186m long ship.  monsoon winds fanned the flames. but easing winds in the indian ocean will make firefighting efforts easier, sri lanka navy chief vice admiral nishantha ulugetenne said, describing the sea and wind conditions as ""favourable"". ""i hope in another few days we can extinguish this fire completely,"" he told afp. sri lanka's marine environment protection authority (mepa) has said it fears the vessel could break up and leak oil onto coastal beaches. ""the hull may not be stable for us to tow the ship away from our waters,"" mepa chairman dharshani lahandapura told afp. the vessel, now anchored, is carrying 278 tonnes of bunker oil and 50 tonnes of marine gasoil, she said. avoidable disasterlahandapura said the crew knew about a nitric acid leak on may 11 before entering sri lankan waters and that the fire could have been avoided if they acted promptly. the ship's operator, x-press feeders of singapore, confirmed they knew about the acid leak, but said attempts to leave the leaking container in india and qatar had failed. it said port authorities in the two countries had rejected requests because they did not have specialist facilities. sri lankan authorities have lodged a formal complaint with police ahead of initiating legal action against the ship's captain. lahandapura said a large quantity of oil threatens to leak and pollute the tourist and fishing region of negombo, 40km north of the capital. ""our best option is to clean the beach and we suspect any clearing operation will take a few weeks, if not months,"" she said. sri lankan soldiers were deployed on thursday to clean negombo beach as debris from eight containers that fell into the sea after the explosion washed ashore. police also arrested eight people who had been scavenging for plastic raw materials and cosmetics that washed up for violating coronavirus lockdown regulations. in september last year, an oil tanker caught fire off sri lanka's east coast after an engine room explosion that killed one crew member. the fire on the new diamond tanker took more than a week to put out and left a 40km long oil spill.  sri lanka has demanded the owners pay a us$17 million clean-up bill. the 25 crew on the x-press pearl were evacuated on tuesday following the explosion.  two suffered minor injuries, the owners said, and one, an indian national, has tested positive for covid-19. the ship was on its way to colombo from india's gujarat state.  the vessel is anchored 14km offshore and can be seen from negombo. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.
