The 156 three-room flats attracted fewer than two applicants for each.\nIn Geylang, 1,382 two-room flexi, three-room and four-room flats are on offer at MacPherson Weave.

Both projects are slated to be completed in the third quarter of 2025.\nTengah, Singapore's newest town, has 782 two-room flexi, four-room and five-room flats in Garden Bloom @ Tengah.

To many people, BTO flats are still considered more affordable and worth the wait,\" she said.In August, HDB will launch about 4,900 flats in Queenstown, Kallang/Whampoa, Tampines, Jurong East and Hougang.Another 3,100 to 3,600 units flats will be offered in Choa Chu Kang, Hougang, Jurong West, Kallang/Whampoa and Tengah in November, with exact site locations to be released in August.Join ST's Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.SPH Digital News / Copyright Â© 2021 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.
