Two of these were detected from a mandatory testing exercise for residents.A total of 405 residents and visitors of the block were tested on May 21 and May 22.Responding to a question raised at Monday's multi-ministry task force press conference, on the circumstances requiring all residents from a block to be tested, Singapore’s Director of Medical Services Kenneth Mak said that when clusters in the domestic setting are picked up, the team will start by looking at the obvious chains of transmission and “the modes of transmission that are of concern”.“When we pick up several cases that occur within a fixed geographic vicinity, then we have to be concerned that there may also be chains of transmission that occur to other people that live in that same area,” said Associate Professor Mak. “And this is the reason why we would then extend and carry out testing operations.”These testing operations are also reinforced by looking at data from other testing modalities, such as wastewater testing.Screening wastewater samples could complement clinical testing and provide an additional indicator to assess the level of Covid-19 spread within a community. This is because infected individuals, including those who have mild symptoms or are asymptomatic could still be shedding the virus in their stool.Assoc Prof Mak noted that this may raise concerns as it could suggest that there are additional people who may be asymptomatic but are potentially infectious to others, creating a sense of urgency to launch testing operations at the respective housing blocks.“So we look at each cluster on a case-by-case basis, looking at the circumstances and making that decision (on) whether we want to organise these testing operations,” he said.Though such operations are not easy to carry out, Assoc Prof Mak noted that they are necessary as part of Singapore’s aggressive testing to stay ahead of the curve and prevent further infections in the community.Join ST's Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.SPH Digital News / Copyright © 2021 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.
