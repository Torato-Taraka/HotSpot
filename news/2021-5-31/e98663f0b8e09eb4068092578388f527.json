Applicants are also not eligible if they are receiving assistance from ComCare, SGUnited or the Seafarers Relief Package.Full-time National Servicemen are not eligible.Those who have previously received the COVID-19 Recovery Grant can apply for the temporary grant if they are not receiving support in June 2021.Individuals can receive up to two tranches of support from the COVID-19 Recovery Grant and one tranche from the temporary grant.HOW TO APPLY?Theonline application portalwill open from 9am on Jun 3 to 11.59pm on Jul 2.Applicants should prepare the following supporting documents:- Documents on bank account details for the disbursement of funds- For employees: Relevant documents indicating placement on involuntary no-pay leave or salary loss of at least 50 per cent for at least a month- For self-employed people: Relevant documents indicating that you are currently self-employedNo proof of job search or training will be required for applicants.This is because the intent of the temporary grant is \"to provide one-off financial support to affected individuals during a period of tightened restrictions, where it may be challenging for applicants to find a job or seek out training opportunities\", said MSF.Those who need help completing the online application form can ring the ComCare Call hotline or email MSF's Social Service Office.
