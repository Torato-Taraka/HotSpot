Change makes people uncomfortable.\"In the Spiegel interview, Fissette also insisted Osaka \"knows it's important to talk to the press\" and is not boycotting the media \"for herself alone\", but is \"concerned with fundamental issues - she wants to bring about change\".Earlier this year, the Japanese superstar won the fourth Grand Slam title of her career at the Australian Open, but has never got past the third round of the French Open.Join ST's Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.SPH Digital News / Copyright Â© 2021 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.
