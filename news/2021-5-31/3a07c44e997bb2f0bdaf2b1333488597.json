Taiwan has also accused China of blocking a deal with Germany's BioNTech, which Beijing denies.Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party said China's comment last week that Taiwan would not succeed in using vaccines to seek its independence showed China was the \"black hand behind the scenes\" preventing Taiwan from getting access to vaccines internationally.The wide use of vaccines is essential to ultimately controlling the virus, it said.\"However, in the face of the pandemic, China has used it as a political bargaining chip to prevent Taiwan from obtaining vaccines from the world,\" the party added.China considers democratically-ruled Taiwan its own territory.DownloadourÂ appor subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:https://cna.asia/telegramIt looks like the email address you entered is not valid.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "MainKeyWord": "China,Taiwan,coronavirus,COVID-19,vaccine,BioNTech", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "URL": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-taiwan-spar-covid-19-vaccines-14920272", "Source": "google"}
