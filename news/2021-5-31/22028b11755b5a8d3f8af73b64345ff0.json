So if a country is safe, we already allow Singaporeans to go there and come back without any quarantine in Singapore,\" he added.\"And we even allow travellers from these places to come to Singapore without quarantine.“On the other hand, if a country is not so safe, there are high incidence rates that are prevalent in these places, then we have tighter border control measures where travellers coming in will have to serve a quarantine in a dedicated facility.”Singapore will continue with this approach “in the coming months”, said Mr Wong.“If more countries become safe, infection rates come down, vaccination rates are high, then potentially, we will be able to open up more with these places,\" he added.“On the other hand, if they are places where the incidence rates will remain high, and there are concerns (that) they are high-risk areas, then the border measures will remain and the quarantine measures will remain.”Downloadour appor subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:https://cna.asia/telegramIt looks like the email address you entered is not valid.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "MainKeyWord": "COVID-19,coronavirus,health,travel", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "URL": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-singapore-travel-overseas-stay-home-notice-restrictions-14920466", "Source": "google"}
