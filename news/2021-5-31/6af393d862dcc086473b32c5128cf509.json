I would have liked in recent months my relationship with the club and with the president (Florentino Perez) to have been a little different from that of other coaches,” Zidane said.“I wasn’t asking for privileges, of course not, but a little more memory,” added Zidane.‘Always grateful’ Zidane’s contract with Real was set to expire in 2022 but he had repeatedly refused to confirm he would still be at the club next season.He has a history of making surprise announcements: as a player, he initially announced his retirement from international football in 2004 before coming back for the 2006 World Cup, after which he retired for good following his red card for butting on Italy’s Marco Materazzi as France lost the final.“Spending 20 years in Madrid has been the most beautiful thing that has ever happened to me in life and I know that I owe it exclusively to Florentino Perez who bet on me in 2001,” Zidane said in the letter.“I say it from the heart, I will always be grateful to the ‘presi’ for it. Always,” he added.Zidane now take another break from football although there has been talk of him either taking charge of the French national team or Juventus, where he spent five years as a player.Juventus are suffering financially as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic and might not be in a position to entice him.Didier Deschamps, who led France to victory in the last World Cup,  is likely to remain national coach until the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, barring a disastrous performance at the European Championship that kicks off next month. — AFPLoading...© 2021, Malay Mail, All Rights Reserved.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "URL": "https://www.malaymail.com/news/sports/2021/05/31/zidane-says-he-quit-real-madrid-because-of-clubs-lack-of-faith/1978448", "MainKeyWord": "", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "Source": "google"}
