I am okay as long as I am being compensated.\"She usually has Sundays off but told her employers that she preferred to stay at home because of the pandemic.\"I haven't had to make many changes, and I still keep in contact with my friends and family through Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp.\"I also do daily exercises when I take my employers - an elderly couple - out for a walk,\" she said.The Centre for Domestic Employees (CDE) has temporarily closed its gathering sites at the Amphitheatre @ 20 Anderson Road, and Let's Gather @ 99 Haig Road.However, the centre has moved its activities such as the upcoming May Day Domestic Employee Celebrations on June 13 online to engage and support the migrant domestic workers (MDWs) community.Said CDE executive director Shamsul Kamar: \"We have shared the tightened measures with MDWs and encouraged them to stay home as much as possible. MDWs and employers who need advice can always reach out to CDE on our 24-hour helpline (1800-2255-233) or through our social media channels and e-mail.\"He added: \"We believe that our MDWs understand the need for the tightened measures, and they are cautious of the situation given the recent community cases.\"They are aware of the risks... and want to play their part in our nation's fight against the virus.\"Get The New Paper on your phone with the free TNP app. Download from the Apple App StoreÂ or Google Play Store now", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "URL": "https://www.tnp.sg/news/singapore/staying-home-days-not-issue-maids", "MainKeyWord": "", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "Source": "google"}
