Total daily cases peaked on May 17 and have been falling since Friday.Taiwan has reported 8,160 infections since the pandemic began, including 110 deaths.Join ST's Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.SPH Digital News / Copyright © 2021 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.
