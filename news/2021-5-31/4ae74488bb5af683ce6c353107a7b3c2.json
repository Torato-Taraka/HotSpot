But they should do so in a hospital setting, after assessment by their treating specialists on their suitability.Active treatment includes chemotherapy, immunotherapy or radiation therapy that individuals have undergone in the past three months or plan to undergo in the next two months.Under the current guidelines, cancer patients on hormonal therapy can continue to be vaccinated at any available vaccination site.MTF said: \"Cancer patients on active cancer treatment remain a vulnerable population that is at an increased risk of complications from Covid-19.\"There is currently no evidence of any safety signals or increased rates of adverse events from mRNA-based Covid-19 vaccines for this group.\"[[nid:513241]]The task force is also finalising guidelines on vaccination for cancer patients on treatment, including those who consult private specialists.Additionally, those with severe cutaneous adverse reactions can also receive the vaccine.Such reactions include the Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, and drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome.These people may go to the vaccination centres if they are part of the population group that is eligible.MTF said the committee is also reviewing the safety data on persons with a history of anaphylaxis, to allow more to be safely vaccinated. The review aims to be completed in the next two weeks and will set out guidelines.\"We will continue to review the data on other types of vaccines and explore bringing in safe and efficacious vaccines that are suitable for individuals not recommended to receive the mRNA-based vaccines,\" MTF said.This article was first published in The Straits Times. Permission required for reproduction.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "URL": "https://www.asiaone.com/singapore/covid-19-pregnant-women-cancer-patients-active-treatment-can-be-vaccinated", "MainKeyWord": "", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "Source": "google"}
