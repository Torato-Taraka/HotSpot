Total daily cases peaked on May 17 and have been falling since Friday.Taiwan has reported 8,160 infections since the pandemic began, including 110 deaths.DownloadourÂ appor subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:https://cna.asia/telegramIt looks like the email address you entered is not valid.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "MainKeyWord": "Taiwan,COVID-19", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "URL": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/taiwan-has-not-given-up-hope-getting-biontech-vaccines-covid-19-14914604", "Source": "google"}
