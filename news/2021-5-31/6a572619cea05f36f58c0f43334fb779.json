Critics say authorities are chipping away at those freedoms, an assertion officials in Hong Kong and Beijing reject.It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "MainKeyWord": "Beijing,Hong Kong,Jimmy Lai", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "URL": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/beijing-hong-kong-slams-judge-intimidation-jimmy-lai-case-14918738", "Source": "google"}
