On Saturday evening, ecstatic Chelsea fans erupted with joy in Porto's streets after their team clinched the title.There has been concern in Portugal that the event could lead to an increase in infections after authorities decided to relax COVID-19 rules for the match, but also due to the highly contagious coronavirus variant spreading in parts of England after first being identified in India.All fans had to present a negative COVID-19 test on arrival. Portugal is on the British government's \"green\" list allowing tourists to visit the country without quarantining on their return.In a statement, the regional health authority (ARS Norte) said that those who were in fan zones or around areas where celebrations took place should monitor for COVID-19 symptoms, including fever, cough and loss of taste or smell.It also said that people should try to \"reduce contacts over the next 14 days\" and strictly follow preventive measures, such as maintaining social distancing and wearing a mask.The recommendations were made due to the high number of fans in Porto who did not comply with COVID-19 rules, ARS Norte said, adding that it would \"keep monitoring the epidemiological situation\" and adjust its response accordingly.DownloadourÂ appor subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:https://cna.asia/telegramIt looks like the email address you entered is not valid.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "MainKeyWord": "COVID-19,coronavirus,Portugal,football,Champions League,Chelsea", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "URL": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/sport/covid-19-portugal-champions-league-monitor-symptoms-14918096", "Source": "google"}
