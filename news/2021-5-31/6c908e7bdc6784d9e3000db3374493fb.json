Many people who were unable or did not wish to proceed with event bookings due to the circuit breaker and phased reopening measures faced difficulty getting back their deposits, said CASE.Some bridal salons and hotels were only willing to postpone the date of the event or cited clauses claiming that bookings made are non-refundable, added the association.CASE said consumers recovered more than S$97,000 worth of prepayments from their event contracts with its assistance.FACE MASKSThe medical and medical consumables industry received 1,256 complaints last year, of which at least 813 were in relation to medical consumables. Consumers generally complained about the pricing of face masks, hand sanitisers and other related consumables, said CASE.Some consumers also said they were misled about the quality or efficacy of face and surgical masks.CASE said it worked closely with the Ministry of Trade and Industry and Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore to monitor and flag profiteering behaviour and unfair practices.BEAUTY AND CARSComplaints against the beauty industry and motorcars industry dropped to 1,363 and 1,180 respectively last year. This was likely due to the closure of non-essential businesses during the circuit breaker, said CASE.About one-third of complaints lodged against beauty businesses were related to unfair practices such as aggressive sales tactics.Some consumers complained that they were led to believe they were paying promotional prices for beauty treatments, but were subsequently pressured to purchase higher-end treatments at higher prices, said CASE.Responding to complaints, CASE signed voluntary compliance agreements with three beauty salons that committed to cease unfair practices.In the motorcars industry, about 36 per cent of complaints were related to defective vehicles. They generally involved consumers discovering defects in the car after purchase and seeking recourse from the dealers to no avail.CASE said it rolled out an online campaign encouraging consumers to send their pre-owned vehicles for independent evaluation before making a purchase, and to educate consumers on their recourse under the Lemon Law.Of the total complaints received across all industries last year, consumers were given advice on how to follow up directly with businesses in 87.4 per cent of instances, said CASE.The remaining 12.6 per cent were filed with CASE, and involved the association negotiating or mediating with the businesses on behalf of consumers.About 70 per cent of filed cases were resolved, with nearly S$2.8 million in cash and in kind recovered for consumers.With COVID-19 drastically changing the consumer landscape, CASE will \"strive to be relevant and respond to the needs of consumers on the ground in these challenging times\", said CASE President Lim Biow Chuan.\"Given the shift in consumer shopping behaviour, CASE will continue to do more to educate consumers on how to protect themselves should purchases go awry.\"It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "MainKeyWord": "CASE,consumer,COVID-19,coronavirus", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "URL": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-case-consumer-complaint-travel-booking-gym-event-refund-14918650", "Source": "google"}
