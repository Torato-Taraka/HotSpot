Earlier this month, the global health body declared it as a \"variant of global concern\".The strain is 1.5 times to two times more transmissible than the strain that first appeared in Wuhan 18 months ago. There are three versions of B1617 - B16171, B16172 and B16173. The second version is the most relevant as it has appeared to overtake B16171 in local cases as well as those reported globally. The third version, B16173, is rare, the report said.While it remains unclear if B1617 causes more serious illness or deaths, the best weapon remains widespread vaccination. Vaccinated individuals have a reduced chance of being infected, and a much lower likelihood of developing severe symptoms even if they are infected, Teo said.Various researches have shown that the Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines are effective against B1617.However, most countries, unfortunately, are lagging far behind in vaccinating their people as global inequity in vaccine supplies and distribution persists.This means a higher chance of B1617 creeping into countries previously minimally affected by Covid-19, Professor Dale Fisher, chair of the WHO's Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, was quoted as saying.\"These countries, such as Thailand, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam, are more vulnerable due to the low vaccination rates, leaving them more susceptible to severe disease,\" Fisher said.Related video:Share this article:Sections on IOLFollow IOLMore on IOLLegalTrending on IOLNewspapersÂ© 2021 Independent Online and affiliated companies.
