Funds raised from these projects went towards supporting Madrasah Irsyad's local operations.In 2014, Madrasah Irsyad's management moved the international side of its fund-raising efforts to ITL.During a 2016 audit of Madrasah Irsyad's accounts, however, it was discovered that the school's management had endorsed a transfer of $2 million to ITL for its international operations.\"Muis requested ITL to repay the monies to the madrasah. ITL returned the $2 million in full to the madrasah in 2016,\" said Mr Masagos.He added that after a review last year, Madrasah Irsyad decided to de-prioritise its international projects. Both the school and ITL agreed that they would no longer be affiliated with each other from January this year, which meant that ITL could no longer use the school's branding for its international projects.Muis then asked for a review of the financial transactions between Madrasah Irsyad and ITL, which is ongoing, and will consider further actions based on the findings of the review.The minister said that while Muis had conducted an internal investigation into Madrasah Irsyad staff after a complaint, it was not linked to ITL or the former Muis senior director, who resigned in 2016.He added that while it was not Muis' practice for religious schools to publish their financial statements, each school is required to submit them to Muis for final audit purposes.Join ST's Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.SPH Digital News / Copyright © 2021 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.
