Tan did not directly refer to the Quadrilateral alliance or Quad comprising the US, India, Australia and Japan while accusing Washington of forming cliques. However, the Chinese Foreign Ministry has in recent weeks stepped up attacks on the four-nation alliance, terming it as an exclusive clique portraying China as a challenge and sowing discord between Beijing and regional countries.Tan, while claiming that China always holds that no strategy should go against the historical trend of peace and development, or deliberately hype up conflict and confrontation, said that intensifying military presence and highlighting military competition will only aggravate regional tensions and endanger world peace and stability.‚ÄúNo strategy should harm the welfare of people in regional countries, or put them in a dangerous situation. Seeking one‚Äôs own selfish interests and unilateral absolute security will only do harm to others and lose their support,‚Äù he was quoted as saying by the Chinese military online.Referring to the reported comments by a US defence department official that the US government intends to put in place more defence hotlines with China to manage security risks and prevent potential conflicts, the Chinese defence ministry spokesperson said that for a long time, the Chinese and American militaries have always maintained communication through multiple channels, including the direct line between the two defence ministries.‚ÄúWe believe that its purpose is to enhance trust, reduce misgivings, manage crises, and prevent conflicts. The US side should not, on the one hand, claim to put up new defence hotlines, while on the other hand keep ramping up military deployments in the Asian Pacific region, frequently conduct close-in reconnaissance on China, and even deliberately initiate dangerous circumstances where aircraft and vessels nearly collide, he said.He said that China advises the US side to keep their words and match their deeds accordingly, display sincerity, work with the Chinese side toward the same goal, and push forward the healthy and stable development of mil-to-mil relations by intensifying dialogue and communication and properly managing divergences.China and the US are currently at loggerheads over a host of issues as the Biden administration continued the tough policy to contain China initiated by Trump, targeting Beijing on Xinjiang, Hong Kong and Taiwan.Biden beefed-up the US-China policy by uniting US allies like the UK, the EU and Japan. He also hosted the first quadrilateral summit of the emerging alliance called Quad in March which included the US, Australia, Japan and India.üì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.
