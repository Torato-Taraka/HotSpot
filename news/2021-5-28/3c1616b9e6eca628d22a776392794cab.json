Many families and friends can't work.\"Melbournians have been ordered to stay at home for seven days to stall transmission and buy the authorities time to investigate how the virus again jumped from hotel quarantine into the community.The outbreak is believed to have begun when a traveller infected with the Indian variant returned to Australia, but Victoria's acting state Premier James Merlino called for military help with the investigation.Around 15,000 close contacts have been identified and the list of venues visited by confirmed cases had grown to 130.Merlino on Thursday blamed sluggish vaccine rollout and hotel quarantine failures for the latest outbreak.\"If we had an alternative to hotel quarantine for this particular variant of concern, we would not be here today,\" he said.It is believed to be the 17th time in six months that the virus has leaked out of makeshift hotel quarantine facilities, which are now facing tough scrutiny.Fingers are also being pointed at Australia's conservative federal government for the slow rate of vaccinations, which threatens to reverse the country's early virus success.Australia has recorded 30,000 Covid-19 cases since the pandemic began -- with a large portion in hotel quarantine -- in a country of 25 million people.But only two percent of Australians have so far been fully vaccinated.\"I'm from New York originally so I feel like we've had a really good go of it here in Australia in terms of how many people have gotten sick,\" said David Gonzalez.\"So I guess I'm willing to accept a bit of a slow rollout but if these things happen more often, they just have to get more vaccines in the country.\"Prime Minister Scott Morrison has defended his government's handling of the crisis saying hotel quarantine facilities were \"99.99 percent effective.\"But critics countered that a single infection leaking from a quarantine system that has processed thousands of travellers was sufficient to shut down an entire state, and the country's second-biggest city.In recent months, Australians had largely been enjoying few restrictions after the country successfully contained the spread of coronavirus.But outbreaks in Taiwan and Japan have underscored how initial success containing the virus can quickly be eroded without widespread vaccination.Australia is currently vaccinating around 75,000 people each day.In a note to clients on Friday, the National Australian Bank warned that it is \"clear that virus outbreaks from hotel quarantine remain a significant risk for Australia until a high degree of vaccine penetration is reached\".\"On the current pace, Australia will not reach a level of vaccination approaching herd immunity (estimates suggest that is around 70% or higher) by the end of the year.\"bur-arb/dm/jahA Malaysian woman who entered Singapore to carry out illegal cosmetic procedures in 2019 was on Friday (28 May) jailed for 10 weeks and fined $5,500.In a wooded corner of Estonia 120 kilometres (75 miles) from the Russian border, some 7,000 soldiers are taking part in a NATO battleground exercise.成功申請可獲迎新獎賞高達$6,600「獎賞錢」，網上申請額外$100「獎賞錢」Find out who stuck with their day jobs and who didn’t.

When asked whether his move would undermine the reputation of the city as a global financial hub, John Lee Ka-chiu said on Thursday he was following the national security law laid down by Beijing last summer that banned acts of subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces. “I am exercising the power because Lai has been charged with two offences of collusion with other countries or external forces to endanger national security,” he said. “It is my duty to specify in my notice to the relevant parties what will be the consequences if they fail to comply with my direction.”Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

The Security Bureau froze nearly HK$500 million (US$64 million) of Lai’s assets earlier this month, including his 71 per cent stake in Next Digital, which publishes the Apple Daily tabloid, as well as the local bank accounts of three other companies he owns. The move marked the first time authorities had invoked new powers to freeze or take control of assets of a listed company that could be related to the commission of a national security crime. But Lee said the warning contained in letters sent to an unspecified number of banks after the freezing was only related to assets under suspicion and people carrying out normal business should have nothing to worry about. Lai has been accused of collusion with a foreign country and was also charged with two counts of conspiracy last month. He is currently serving 14 months in prison for taking part in unauthorised assemblies connected to the anti-government protests of 2019. Jimmy Lai asset freeze nothing to do with press freedom, says security chief A spokesman of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, which is responsible for maintaining the city’s status as a financial centre, said it would not comment on cases under investigation by police. But he pointed to the long history that banks had in cooperating with law enforcement agencies in criminal investigations, including freezing and confiscating funds and property under relevant laws, including the national security law. Next Digital resumed trading after a 10-day suspension following the freezing of Lai’s assets and its share price surged 330 per cent from the HK$0.19 (US$0.02) at opening to as high as HK$0.80 (US$0.10), before falling to HK$0.28 (US$0.04) at the close of market. Next Digital’s management issued a statement on Wednesday saying its unaudited bank and cash balances as of March 31 stood at HK$521.4 million (US$67 million) and its working capital would last a minimum of 18 months from April 1, even without additional funding from Lai. It also said the asset freeze had no impact on a standing shareholder’s loan Lai had provided to the company and its subsidiaries. But that assessment was questioned by former city leader Leung Chun-ying who has been a staunch critic of Apple Daily but also revealed that he was a minority stakeholder in the company. Leung put the reserves closer to HK$100 million, after subtracting outstanding bank loans totalling HK$93.6 million, and other liabilities and payables. “Will the bank call the loans? Will suppliers continue to offer credit terms?” he said on his Facebook page. Noting the statement was issued by the board, Leung questioned why it had not made its own assessment during the trading suspension, rather than relying on the management’s. Ex-Hong Kong leader has government on the defensive. Is he planning a comeback? “Who is the person in charge of the management? This is the chief executive officer. And who is the chief executive officer? He is Cheung Kim-hung,” he wrote. The former leader – who is also a vice-chairman of China’s top political advisory body – had already lashed out at Cheung before Next Digital’s announcement, revealing on Wednesday that he had appointed a lawyer to file a formal complaint with law enforcement against the CEO for making “negligent, irresponsible and intentionally misleading” remarks. Leung disputed Cheung’s suggestion the company’s operations and finances would not be affected by the freezing of Lai’s assets, and demanded a thorough investigation by authorities. Asked about the criticisms, Cheung declined to comment.
