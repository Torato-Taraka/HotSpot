He had to be hospitalised for 27 days.Sim's previous conviction involved another roommate at a different home.The court heard that in May 2017, Sim was sentenced to 18 months' jail for splashing hot water on his roommate and slashing him with a knife.DPP Ling noted the similarity in the cases and urged the court for a higher sentence than before.Sim, who was unrepresented, promised not to fight with others in the future and said that he wished to return to the shelter home.For voluntarily causing hurt, Sim could have been jailed for up to three years, fined up to $5,000, or both.This article was first published in The Straits Times.Â Permission required for reproduction.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "URL": "https://www.asiaone.com/singapore/93-year-old-jailed-again-hitting-shelter-home-roommate", "MainKeyWord": "", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "Source": "google"}
