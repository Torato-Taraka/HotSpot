Instead, he should be convicted of causing grievous hurt by a rash act, which carries a lower maximum jail term.Mr Pereira said Lee was unaware that the police officer's arm was caught in the car, and did not know the officer was in \"any direct position of danger\".Lee had defied the officer's instructions to stop and driven off with the officer hanging from the driver's door. The officer was dragged along the road for 124m at a speed of at least 79kmh and later fell off, suffering injuries to his knee, neck and back.He was given more than 20 days of medical leave and received a medical downgrade in his job.HE REPEATEDLY LIED UNDER OATH: PROSECUTORDeputy Public Prosecutor Timotheus Koh called for the appeals to be dismissed, saying that LeeÂ repeatedly lied under oath.\"Now he's trying to run a case that he was only acting impulsively and was in a state of panic and fear, that he was unaware of the police presence next to the car and (that he was) caught in the car,\" said Mr Koh.\"The reality is that these (assertions) were never tested in the lower court, and no evidence was led in this regard.\"Justice Aedit Abdullah noted that the new defence lawyers had tried their best despite taking up the case only recently, but said he was not convinced that the convictions were in error.He said Lee knew the police officer was next to his vehicle and it was \"strongly inferrable\" that he knew the officer would be hit.\"This is beyond mere rashness,\" he said, adding that those who are stopped by the police should not evade them. He upheld the original convictions and sentence.Lee faces numerous other pending charges, including for driving dangerously after he was banned from driving. He has been remanded since March this year after being arrested for the traffic offences.He is due back in court next month for a pre-trial conference for the pending charges.It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "MainKeyWord": "court,crime,Lee Cheng Yan,appeals,High Court", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "URL": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/lee-cheng-yan-maserati-appeal-dragging-police-officer-14903720", "Source": "google"}
