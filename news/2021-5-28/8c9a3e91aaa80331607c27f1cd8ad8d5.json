He was placed in a lock-up at the Woodlands Police Division Headquarters. It was his second time being arrested for theft from a vehicle in a week. He had been arrested on 9 October and released on bail the next day after stealing three handphones and a power bank of unknown value along with a cash card with a stored value of about $40 from a rag-and-bone man's lorry.While in the lock-up on 14 October, Sulaiman was given lunch and a paper cup containing a drink. He later defecated into the paper cup and kept his faeces in it.At about 6.30pm, an auxiliary policeman went to Sulaiman's cell to pass him his dinner. But the latter took the paper cup containing his faeces and threw it at the officer, causing the excrement to land on the cop's uniform, over his torso, his pants and his boots.The officer asked Sulaiman to explain his actions but the latter simply ignored him. The auxiliary policeman then reported the incident to his superior and went to clean himself up.Out on bail just a week later, Sulaiman and his then girlfriend Nurul Natasha Roslan, 26, stole a $7,000 motorcycle from an open carpark in Marine Crescent at about 1am on 21 October. Its owner had accidentally left his keys in the ignition as he was tired. He had also left his helmet on the motorbike.At the time, Sulaiman was under a 25-year driving ban which took effect from April last year. He also rode the bike without valid insurance policy. Then on 23 October, at around midnight, Sulaiman and Natasha broke into a food centre in Tai Seng, Kim Chuan Eating House, and made off with $430 from the cash register of a drink stall.The couple were arrested at a hotel at about 1.45am the next day. The motorcycle they had stolen three days earlier was found parked at the hotel and returned to its owner. In 2009, Sulaiman was also convicted of housebreaking at night. The maximum punishment for housebreaking is up to 10 years' jail along and a fine. Male repeat offenders who are below 50 are liable to be caned.More Singapore news:Stay in the know on-the-go: Join Yahoo Singapore's Telegram channel at http://t.me/YahooSingaporeOther Singapore stories:Of 30 new COVID cases in Singapore, 15 in communityMother who had postnatal depression committed suicide with baby: State Coroner'Worst kind of harassment': Halimah, Masagos, Muis condemn poll sexualising ustazahMan broke into house for cigarettes, kissed sleeping neighbourSingapore's Jem/Westgate cluster grows to 60 COVID casesIn a wooded corner of Estonia 120 kilometres (75 miles) from the Russian border, some 7,000 soldiers are taking part in a NATO battleground exercise.A Malaysian woman who entered Singapore to carry out illegal cosmetic procedures in 2019 was on Friday (28 May) jailed for 10 weeks and fined $5,500.成功申請可獲迎新獎賞高達$6,600「獎賞錢」，網上申請額外$100「獎賞錢」The grave keeps getting deeper for Tajuddin Abdul Rahman.

When asked whether his move would undermine the reputation of the city as a global financial hub, John Lee Ka-chiu said on Thursday he was following the national security law laid down by Beijing last summer that banned acts of subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces. “I am exercising the power because Lai has been charged with two offences of collusion with other countries or external forces to endanger national security,” he said. “It is my duty to specify in my notice to the relevant parties what will be the consequences if they fail to comply with my direction.”Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

The Security Bureau froze nearly HK$500 million (US$64 million) of Lai’s assets earlier this month, including his 71 per cent stake in Next Digital, which publishes the Apple Daily tabloid, as well as the local bank accounts of three other companies he owns. The move marked the first time authorities had invoked new powers to freeze or take control of assets of a listed company that could be related to the commission of a national security crime. But Lee said the warning contained in letters sent to an unspecified number of banks after the freezing was only related to assets under suspicion and people carrying out normal business should have nothing to worry about. Lai has been accused of collusion with a foreign country and was also charged with two counts of conspiracy last month. He is currently serving 14 months in prison for taking part in unauthorised assemblies connected to the anti-government protests of 2019. Jimmy Lai asset freeze nothing to do with press freedom, says security chief A spokesman of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, which is responsible for maintaining the city’s status as a financial centre, said it would not comment on cases under investigation by police. But he pointed to the long history that banks had in cooperating with law enforcement agencies in criminal investigations, including freezing and confiscating funds and property under relevant laws, including the national security law. Next Digital resumed trading after a 10-day suspension following the freezing of Lai’s assets and its share price surged 330 per cent from the HK$0.19 (US$0.02) at opening to as high as HK$0.80 (US$0.10), before falling to HK$0.28 (US$0.04) at the close of market. Next Digital’s management issued a statement on Wednesday saying its unaudited bank and cash balances as of March 31 stood at HK$521.4 million (US$67 million) and its working capital would last a minimum of 18 months from April 1, even without additional funding from Lai. It also said the asset freeze had no impact on a standing shareholder’s loan Lai had provided to the company and its subsidiaries. But that assessment was questioned by former city leader Leung Chun-ying who has been a staunch critic of Apple Daily but also revealed that he was a minority stakeholder in the company. Leung put the reserves closer to HK$100 million, after subtracting outstanding bank loans totalling HK$93.6 million, and other liabilities and payables. “Will the bank call the loans? Will suppliers continue to offer credit terms?” he said on his Facebook page. Noting the statement was issued by the board, Leung questioned why it had not made its own assessment during the trading suspension, rather than relying on the management’s. Ex-Hong Kong leader has government on the defensive. Is he planning a comeback? “Who is the person in charge of the management? This is the chief executive officer. And who is the chief executive officer? He is Cheung Kim-hung,” he wrote. The former leader – who is also a vice-chairman of China’s top political advisory body – had already lashed out at Cheung before Next Digital’s announcement, revealing on Wednesday that he had appointed a lawyer to file a formal complaint with law enforcement against the CEO for making “negligent, irresponsible and intentionally misleading” remarks. Leung disputed Cheung’s suggestion the company’s operations and finances would not be affected by the freezing of Lai’s assets, and demanded a thorough investigation by authorities. Asked about the criticisms, Cheung declined to comment.
