If there are other countries that believe that they'd like to engage and work with us, the door will be open as we go forward,\" Campbell said.The March Quad summit was carefully choreographed to counter China's growing influence and Biden and his fellow leaders pledged to work to ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific in the face of challenges from Beijing.At that meeting, the leaders agreed an in-person summit would be held later in the year.It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "MainKeyWord": "Quad,business and finance,infrastructure,Joe Biden,Kurt Campbell,US", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "URL": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/us-says-looking-at-quad-meeting-in-fall-focused-on-infrastructure-14893692", "Source": "google"}
