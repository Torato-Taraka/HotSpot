Marseille’s Duje Caleta-Car and Villarreal’s Pau Torres were also on the shortlist, according to various  reports, with Liverpool having been keen to bring in the former in the January transfer window, only for a £20m deal to be scuppered by Marseille not having enough time to find a replacement of their own. Why, then, was Konate chosen ahead of the other two to bolster Jürgen Klopp’s defensive options for next season and beyond?In terms of pass completion, they’re all fairly similar based on their statistics from the 2020/21 campaign: Konate with 86.4%, Caleta-Car with 86.9% and Torres a little further ahead with 89.2%.Torres is noticeably superior when it comes to progressive passes (defined as any pass which moves the ball at least 10 yards from its furthest point in the last six passes, excluding passes in the defensive 40% of the pitch, or any pass into the opposition penalty area), averaging 4.18 per 90, versus 2.85 for Konate and 2.62 for Caleta-Car.Konate, though, is much more adept at carrying the ball forward with driving runs than he is in terms of his passing ability at this point in his career. On average, he carried the ball 212 yards towards the opponent’s goal per game last season, which puts him in the 96th percentile of all Bundesliga centre-backs in this metric. That’s almost double Caleta-Car’s progressive carrying average of 107 yards, and marginally behind Torres’ average of 218.Konate is also an exceptional dribbler, ranking in the 91st percentile of all Bundesliga centre-backs for successful take-ons and the 85th percentile for dribble success last season, so his ability to launch attacks in this way will bring a great deal to Liverpool’s build-up play – something which Joe Gomez and Joel Matip also excel in, while Virgil van Dijk is the outstanding long-range passer of Liverpool’s current centre-backs.When it comes to aerial duels, Konate performs very well, winning 75% on average (in the 94th percentile of Bundesliga centre-backs), slightly below Caleta-Car (77.7%) but way above Torres (60.6%), which may go some way to explaining why Liverpool didn’t go for the Spaniard despite his excellent on-the-ball numbers.In addition, Konate is the tallest of the trio, standing at 6ft 4in, versus Caleta-Car (6ft 2in) and Torres (6ft 3in), as well as being the youngest of the lot, having only just turned 22 this week, compared to the other two who are both 24. Despite his physical stature, Konate is also extremely quick, which, given the high defensive line Liverpool tend to play, is a hugely valuable attribute.Overall, therefore, while Torres is the most accomplished in possession-based statistics and Caleta-Car is the strongest in the air, Konate offers an excellent blend of qualities which perhaps makes him the most well-rounded of the three, while still having so much scope for further development. Concerns over his injury record also have seem to have been alleviated following a medical examination.For £35m, Liverpool have taken decisive action to safeguard the future of their defence for many years to come, with Konate’s arrival also taking some of the pressure off Van Dijk, Gomez and Matip on their road to recovery.All date in this article was sourced via Fbref.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "URL": "https://www.liverpool.com/liverpool-fc-news/features/liverpool-ibrahima-konate-secret-ingredient-20697122", "MainKeyWord": "", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "Source": "google"}
