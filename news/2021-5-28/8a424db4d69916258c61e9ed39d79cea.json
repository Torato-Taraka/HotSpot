We live with fear because we don't know what will happen.\"\"WE ARE IN TROUBLE\"Father-of-three Win Naing Tun, 26, said those who could previously afford to eat pork regularly have been forced to turn to fish paste and vegetables.And those who survived on that limited diet before \"now can only afford to eat white rice with salt\",Â he told AFP.Price hikes have hit remote areas particularly hard - near the Chinese border in Kachin state, rice is almost 50 per cent more expensive, according to the WFP.The cost of transporting produce from farms to cities has also jumped after an estimated 30 per cent fuel price hike since the coup.The WFP estimates that within the next six months, as many as 3.4 million more people will go hungry in Myanmar and it is poised to triple its emergency food assistance.A grassroots community food donation programme is proving to be in high demand in Yangon, Myanmar's commercial capital.\"They are happy when we donate food. Some even cry,\" volunteer May, not her real name, told AFP.Ni Aye, 51, said she and her husband now have no income at all and depend on handouts for the food they eat.\"We are in trouble ... If these conditions continue we will starve,\" she told AFP.Aung Kyaw Moe, 47, is considering returning to his home village after the Yangon factory he worked in shut down.He told AFP he had no money saved up and was in despair over how to support his family of nine, who are squatting illegally with him in the commercial capital.\"Everything is outside our control,\" he told AFP.It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "MainKeyWord": "Myanmar,Yangon,food,coup", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "URL": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/myanmar-coup-price-hike-food-hunger-money-economy-14902606", "Source": "google"}
