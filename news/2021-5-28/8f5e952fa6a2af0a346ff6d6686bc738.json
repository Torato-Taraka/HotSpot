The problem was something outside of the contract,\" he said, without elaborating.BioNTech declined to comment.China considers Taiwan its own territory and strongly objects to any references that imply Taiwan is a separate country.Chen's comments came a day after Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen directly accused China of blocking the deal with BioNTech.The German company, which sells its vaccine in partnership with Pfizer, declined to comment on Tsai's remarks.Taiwan's medical system is coming under increasing strain due to a spike in domestic infections with only about 1 per cent of the population of more than 23 million vaccinated.China has repeatedly said its vaccine offer via BioNTech's Chinese sales agent Fosun is sincere and Taiwan should not put up political roadblocks.Taiwan does not believe China is sincere in offering it vaccines and thinks Beijing is launching a \"political warfare\" against the island, officials briefed on the matter told Reuters.Taiwan announced 667 new domestic COVID-19 cases on Thursday, including 266 cases added to previous days' totals.It has reported 6,761 infections since the pandemic began, including 59 deaths.Downloadour appor subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:https://cna.asia/telegramIt looks like the email address you entered is not valid.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "MainKeyWord": "COVID-19,vaccine,BioNTech,China,Taiwan", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "URL": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/taiwan-covid-19-biontech-vaccine-deal-collapse-china-14897454", "Source": "google"}
