{"Type": "", "Time": "2021-05-28", "Headline": "Biden’s Asia Czar Says Era of Engagement With China Is Over", "Text": "Get the daily Fully Briefed newsletter, straight to your inbox.(Bloomberg) --The U.S. is entering a period of intense competition with China as the government running the world’s second-biggest economy becomes ever more tightly controlled by President Xi Jinping, the White House’s top official for Asia said.“The period that was broadly described as engagement has come to an end,” Kurt Campbell, the U.S. coordinator for Indo-Pacific affairs on the National Security Council, said Wednesday at an event hosted by Stanford University. U.S. policy toward China will now operate under a “new set of strategic parameters,” Campbell said, adding that “the dominant paradigm is going to be competition.”Chinese policies under Xi are in large part responsible for the shift in U.S. policy, Campbell said, citing military clashes on China’s border with India, an “economic campaign” against Australia and the rise of “wolf warrior” diplomacy. Beijing’s behavior was emblematic of a shift toward “harsh power, or hard power,” which “signals that China is determined to play a more assertive role,” he said.The blunt comments were among several signs of fresh tensions between the two countries, even as U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He held their first phone call. Before the talks, Tai told Reuters that the two sides faced “very large challenges” and President Joe Biden announced that he had ordered the U.S. intelligence community to “redouble” its efforts to determine whether the Covid-19 virus had escaped from a Chinese lab.Biden said in a statement Wednesday that Chinese officials needed to be more transparent, and that Beijing should join an “evidence-based international investigation and to provide access to all relevant data and evidence.” The Chinese Embassy in Washington dismissed the inquiry as a “smear campaign and blame shifting” that would hurt efforts to prevent future health crises.China Foreign Ministry Spokesman Zhao Lijian said at a regular press briefing Thursday in Beijing that the two countries “stand to gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation.”“China-U.S. relations will naturally experience some competition, which is prevalent among other major-country relations, but it is wrong to define the relationship with competition because it will only lead to confrontation and conflict,” he said.The two countries are also locked in disputes over Beijing’s claims over the South China Sea, human rights in the Xinjiang region, the future of Taiwan and Hong Kong and economic concerns including the deployment of 5G technology and a global shortage of semiconductors. Chinese and U.S. officials have said they see areas of cooperation, particularly on climate change, but on many other issues the relationship is far more frosty.“The U.S. idea of engagement is one that has conditions and is about bringing China into its system, not only in economics but also in politics,” said Wang Yiwei, director of Renmin University’s Institute of International Affairs and a former Chinese diplomat. “The U.S. sees China overtaking its own economy, so it is looking to contain China and prevent it from moving up the value chain.”Campbell knows well what it’s like to negotiate with angry Chinese diplomats. In March he was among U.S. officials who met with their Chinese counterparts in Alaska in talks that got off to a rocky start with bickering before reporters and cameras over human rights, trade and international alliances.‘Unsentimental’ XiCampbell said Xi was at the heart of the U.S.’s new approach to China ties. He described the Chinese president was “deeply ideological, but also quite unsentimental” and “not terribly interested in economics.”Since coming to power in 2012, Xi has “almost completely disassembled nearly 40 years of mechanisms designed for collective leadership,” Campbell said, adding that top Chinese diplomats such as Politburo member Yang Jiechi and Foreign Minister Wang Yi -- the senior officials dispatched to the talks in Alaska -- are “nowhere near, within a hundred miles” of the Chinese leader’s inner circle.Allies will be central to U.S. efforts to push back against China in the years ahead, Campbell said. The U.S. has already tried to build up the importance of its work within the so-called Quad group of nations, which includes India, Japan and Australia. And Biden’s first meetings at the White House with foreign heads of state were with Japan’s Yoshihide Suga and South Korea’s Moon Jae-in.“We believe that the best way to engage a more assertive China is to work with allies, partners and friends,” Campbell said, adding that “the best China policy really is a good Asia policy.” Still, he said the U.S. will need to dispel fears of American decline in Asia and offer a “positive economic vision” for the region.“For the first time, really, we are now shifting our strategic focus, our economic interests, our military might more to the Indo-Pacific,” Campbell said.(Updates with China Foreign Ministry comments in sixth paragraph.)More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.Stocks gained on Friday as investors considered new economic data on consumer spending, income and inflation alongside stronger-than-expected data reports from earlier this week.The flaw creates covert channels that let malicious apps communicate with each other.激抵！用Smart卡去759 阿信屋買零食、家居用品及個人護理等都可享5%現金回贈，日日Smart住使！FORM 8.3 IRISH TAKEOVER PANELDISCLOSURE UNDER RULE 8.3 OF THE IRISH TAKEOVER PANEL ACT, 1997, TAKEOVER RULES, 2013DEALINGS BY PERSONS WITH INTERESTS IN RELEVANT SECURITIES REPRESENTING 1% OR MORE 1.

A group of guys with a passion for the veteran community, expertise in blockchain technology, and a successful marketing agency decided to put their skill sets together for a great cause. Military.Finance is the first cryptocurrency to dedicate a percentage of every transaction towards helping veterans. Their first large promotion will take place June 18th, in Nashville, TN when Military.Finance will become the first cryptocurrency to sponsor a NASCAR truck. The partnership developed rather quickly and appears to be a solid bond. Driver Keith McGee served in the Air Force and made his NASCAR debut in 2018. That year McGee competed in the NASCAR Whelen All-American Series, finishing second in points, driving at his home track, Alaska Raceway Park. He is currently one of only two veterans on the Nascar circuit and the only disabled veteran. “It’s funny how things find a way of working out,” says Brad Dahl, developer of the Military.Finance cryptocurrency. “Keith was looking for a new sponsor, and we were looking for partnerships that believe in our mission that could help spread the word.” The sponsorship with NASCAR and driver Keith McGee is one of many made within the early stages of this token’s existence. Military.Finance also partnered with Major Ed Pulido and the Heart of a Lion Foundation as the 501c3 charity for all of the initial donations. Heart of a Lion is recognized as one of the top organizations supporting soldiers and families that face many challenges when coming back from the battlefield. Along with the NASCAR race in June, Military.Finance plans on participating in several other upcoming events. June 12th: Celebrity Softball Classic, Texas Ranger StadiumJune 18th: NASCAR | Rackley Roofing 200, Nashville SuperspeedwayJune 19th: John Daly Golf Classic, Lion’s Den Golf Course If you’re interested in the token, the currency is currently available on PankcakeSwap as part of the Smart Chain Binance Network.

The Valorem property claims in the Lightning Creek and Barkerville areas are represented by a red rectangle. VANCOUVER, British Columbia, May 28, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- VALOREM RESOURCES INC. (the “Company” or “Valorem”) (CSE: VALU) (Frankfurt: 1XW1) is pleased to provide an update on exploration programs planned for its three gold, nickel, gold-copper, and specimen crystal prospects in British Columbia, Canada. The first two properties, the BC Gold Project and the Lac La Hache Gold Project, are located in the Cariboo District near the historical and currently active mining town of Barkerville in central British Columbia, while the third property, the Pinto Gold-Copper Project, is in the historical Franklin Mining Camp north of the town of Grand Forks in south central British Columbia. The BC Gold Project is located southwest of the main Barkerville District (see our news release dated January 29, 2021, and red square on Figure 2 below), and a second project also located in the Cariboo District, the Lac La Hache Gold Project, is located northeast of 100 Mile House on the north shore of Spout Lake. A third property, the Pinto Gold-Copper Project is located in the Franklin mining camp north of Grand Forks in south central British Columbia. BC Gold Project The BC Gold Project, totalling 4,000 hectares, is comprised of three claim groups, the West, Central and East (see Figure 1), extending for approximately 9-15 kms southwest of the Osisko Development Cariboo Gold Project. As shown on Figure 2, the property area is located in the red rectangle to the southwest of the town of Barkerville. Figure 1: https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/b4dd3b82-9cdd-468c-b0ba-dec16f83c697 Figure 2: https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/bd91497c-9f48-45a4-9a17-2f153ed3e5d1 The reader is cautioned that the presence of a deposit on the adjoining Osisko Development ground does not necessarily indicate that any such mineralization may be present on the Company’s holdings in the area, or that if discovered, any such mineralization may be economically extracted. The Western Claims of the BC Gold Project are located near the Mostique Creek and Lightening Creek placer areas (see B.C. Minfile No. 093G009 and No. 093G060, respectively). In addition, it covers the Gem gold showing, a turbidite-hosted gold target (see B.C. Minfile No. 093G073). Exploration planned for the Western claim group containing the two placer showings and the one bedrock showing in black phyllites will consist of in-depth prospecting and sampling of previously excavated pits on the gold showing in bedrock black phyllites, and compilation of all existing Min files on this area. Encouraging geochemical values of gold are noted in Min files from bedrock sources sampled by previous prospecting. The Central claims contain the Sovreign nickel-talc-magnesite showing (Assessment File Sovreign Creek deposit, 093A 013). Also within the Central unit are the Peters Creek surficial Placers and the Wormwold Creek surficial placers. Exploration work planned for the Central claims include a re-evaluation of all work done on the nickel and talc zones prospected by historical work to follow up the potential for disseminated nickel values occurring as pentlandite (Property file-Findlay, 1971). Creek bottom geochemical sampling and ridgeline geochemical sampling and bedrock sampling for both nickel and gold, and prospecting will be conducted throughout the Central claims. The Eastern claims cover several potentially economic target types. The prime targets are the potential for orogenic gold deposits in the Snowshoe Group of rocks that host many gold occurrences in the Barkerville district, plus potential for nickel in serpentinized ultramafic rocks within the property. Also in this claim group are the Emerald Valley showings of quartz-tourmaline pegmatite veins that host very large quartz and plagioclase feldspar crystals of possible value as gem material or specimen material for potential sale to mineral collectors (Assessment Report 33212). Both geochemical sampling on creeks and ridges, and prospecting in both the nickel and specimen crystal areas will be undertaken on the Eastern claims. There is no resource delineated on any of the claim groups in the BC Gold Project holdings Lac La Hache Property The second property, the Lac La Hache Gold Project, comprises 180 hectares on the north shore of Spout Lake in the Cariboo gold district located northeast of 100 Mile House. To the south of Spout Lake Engold has been drilling a deposit variously characterized as skarn, carbonate replacement, or porphyry copper deposit containing a modest tonnage of copper-magnetite mineralization. Garibaldi Resources has also been exploring a similar discovery in this area. The upcoming program for the Valorem property in this area will consist of geological, geophysical and geochemical surveying to seek a significant deposit in this prospective area. The property is in the early stage of exploration and no resource has yet been established on the property. Pinto Gold Project The third property holding, the Pinto Gold-Copper Project, covers 80.9 hectares just north of the historic Franklin Mining Camp located 50 km north of Grand Forks in south central British Columbia. This property is in an area which has been subject to historical exploration interest by multiple majors during the 1980s, including both Noranda Exploration Company Ltd. and Inco Ltd. (see B.C. Minfile No. 082ENE19). Several old workings and historical adits and shallow open pits are scattered in the area. A grab sample by Inco in 1989 assayed 6.829 g/t gold, and a chip sample from a one-meter width of stockwork assayed 4.6 g/t gold (B.C. Minfile No. 082ENE19 and B.C. Assessment report 19385). The Pinto property covers portions of an intrusive complex that contains multiple showings of gold and copper that have been compared to and may be analogous to the historical Phoenix Mining Camp located south of Greenwood, B.C., some 70 km to the southwest of the Franklin Camp. The former Phoenix Mine produced 25.5 million tonnes of ore averaging 0.9% copper and 1.1 grams gold per tonne. It was mined both from underground and as an open pit from 1900-19 and again from 1956-78 (Northern Miner Press, March 12, 2021). Current VTEM surveying is being conducted in the vicinity of the Phoenix Mine in the search for additional copper-gold deposits. The presence of copper-gold deposits in the analogous Phoenix Mine does not infer that any such mineralization may be present on the Company’s holdings, or that if discovered that any such deposit may be economically recoverable. Exploration on the Pinto property will consist of re-evaluation of all available data, prospecting and possibly airborne geophysical VTEM surveying to detect the potential for an intrusive-related porphyry copper style deposit. Tony Louie, President of the Company, stated: \"Valorem is very pleased to provide our shareholders with material exposure to the historic Cariboo gold district. The acquisition of the BC Gold Project and the Lac la Hache Gold Project establishes our presence in a premier historic gold camp in BC. Additionally, the Pinto Gold-Copper Project provides an entry into the historical Franklin Mining Camp.” Qualified Person: This press release has been prepared by, supervised by and approved by Dr. Stewart A Jackson, PGeo, a Qualified Person under National Instrument 43-101, and independent of the Company.
