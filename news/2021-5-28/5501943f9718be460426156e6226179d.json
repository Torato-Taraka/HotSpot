And under such a circumstance, I don't think we should be going to the President to seek permission to draw on our past reserves\" said the minister, adding that Singapore must expect to run into situations like this from time to time, when restrictions need to be tightened temporarily to control the spread of the virus.\"So we will have to learn to adapt to such situations, using our own resources rather than to dip into our past reserves, and it's on that basis that we are able to set aside some funds for this package,\" said Mr Wong.Rental relief will also be given to small and medium-sized enterprises as well as eligible non-profit organisations in commercial properties, while eligible lower- to middle-income workers and self-employed workers whose income have been affected by the measures can receive a one-off payout of up to $700 under a new Covid-19 Recovery Grant (Temporary).Under the current Covid-19 measures, services such as dining in, facials and saunas are barred from May 16 to June 13, while tighter capacity caps apply to retail spaces such as shopping centres and showrooms. Social gatherings are capped at two people.[[nid:489530]]Indoor sports facilities such as gyms, too, face tougher operating restrictions from May 8 to June 13 - including having to close, unless they offer only low-intensity activities, where participants are masked and do not share common equipment.Some support has been given to businesses and workers to cushion the impact of the measures, but companies have sought more help from landlords and the Government.For instance, food and beverage businesses will get 50 per cent wage subsidies under the JSS during the period for which dining in is prohibited, up from 10 per cent. Hawkers and coffee shop stallholders who are tenants of government agencies will also get a one-month rental waiver.At least five mall operators have also pledged to help tenants hit by the stricter measures imposed on May 16, including by offering rental rebates.This article was first published in The Straits Times. Permission required for reproduction.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "URL": "https://www.asiaone.com/singapore/govt-announces-800m-covid-19-support-package-workers-and-businesses", "MainKeyWord": "", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "Source": "google"}
