By dividing the past 14 days into two halves, the first seven days (17-23 May) saw 182 cases, followed by 136 cases in the next seven days.In addition, the percentage of unlinked cases has also fallen from 22 per cent of all cases to 18 per cent. One key method for controlling and monitoring infections is testing, Ong said. In the second half of May, on average, more than 55,000 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and Antigen Rapid Test (ART) tests were conducted each day, according to Ong. \"All in all, we are nudging in the right direction, but just nudging, and controlling the situation,\" said Ong. Stay in the know on-the-go: Join Yahoo Singapore's Telegram channel at http://t.me/YahooSingaporeRelated stories:Possible easing of COVID restrictions after 13 June if community cases fall further: Lee Hsien LoongSingapore to make over-the-counter DIY COVID-19 tests available to residentsCOVID-19: Vaccination bookings for Singapore students to begin from 1 June400,000 students in Singapore can register for COVID vaccine from 1 JuneSingapore to allow alternative COVID-19 vaccines for use by private sectorHousehold members of close contact of COVID-19 case to be isolated immediately: PM LeeCOVID vaccination guidelines eased for pregnant, breastfeeding women, cancer patientsHousehold contacts of quarantined persons must self-isolate at home: MOHMalaysia's air force scrambled jets to intercept 16 Chinese military aircraft off the country's coast in the South China Sea, a rare incident officials said Tuesday threatened \"national sovereignty\".The US military will hand over its main Bagram Air Base to Afghan forces in about 20 days, an official said Tuesday, as Washington presses on with withdrawing the last of its troops from the country.與人氣遊戲《集合啦！動物森友會》首度推出UT系列，讓島民於日常都可分享歡樂時光!China on Tuesday denied an Australian academic's claims that he had been tortured in custody during his two-year detention on espionage charges.If you’ve got a Citibank credit card, you’re in luck.
