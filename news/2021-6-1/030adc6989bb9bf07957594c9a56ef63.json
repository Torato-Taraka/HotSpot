The less accurate ART returns results in about 30 minutes and is used heavily for pre-event testing.The pilot use of such ART at worksites is being overseen by the BCA, the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Ministry of Manpower (MOM).In its circular, the BCA said it is currently engaging worksites on the pilot initiative, and that more worksites will be progressively included as Singapore ramps up its supply of antigen rapid tests.More details on the requirements and implementation of the tests will be provided when they are ready, including the necessary training and preparation required, the BCA added.MOH said on Monday that it will be extending the use of ARTs further, with pilots in student hostels in autonomous universities. It will also work with CapitaLand to run pilots at one or two selected malls for tenants and people who work there.Those whose rapid test returns a positive result will need to take a PCR test at a Swab and Send Home Public Health Preparedness Clinic or regional screening centre to confirm if they have Covid-19. They are required to self-isolate until they receive a negative PCR test result. \nTags / Keywords:\nantigen rapid tests\n                                                                ,\n                                                                                                ART\n                                                                ,\n                                                                                                construction worksites\n                                                                ,\n                                                                                                covid-19\n\n\n\nReport it to us.Thank you for your report!Copyright © 1995-\n            \n\n Star Media Group Berhad (10894D)Best viewed on Chrome browsers.{{item['V1 Header']}}\n   {{item['V1 Body']}}\n\n  {{item['V2 Header']}}\n\nAre you having urinary troubles?
