Israeli media have speculated it could also court parliamentary backing from a party that draws votes from Israel's Arab minority.That has prompted Netanyahu to accuse Bennett of imperiling Israel as it contends with internal Jewish-Arab strife over last month's Gaza conflict, the moribund peace process with the Palestinians, and Iran.Netanyahu, 71, is the dominant political figure of his generation. He was first elected prime minister in 1996 and he returned to power in 2009, holding the top office for more than a decade. But he also faces a corruption trial for bribery, fraud and breach of trust - charges he denies.DIVIDED COUNTRYA photo-shopped picture of Bennett in an Arab headdress, circulated on social media, prompted comparisons with attempts to discredit former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, assassinated in 1995 by an ultranationalist opposed to his peacemaking.Lapid said on Monday that both he and Bennett had been given extra security following threats to their safety. Both have said they want to bring together Israelis from across the political divide and end hateful political discourse.\"A country that is divided and violent won't be able to deal with Iran or with the economy. A leadership that incites us against one another harms our ability to deal with the challenges we face,\" Lapid said.It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "MainKeyWord": "Benjamin Netanyahu,Naftali Bennett,Israel", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "URL": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/netanyahu-legal-challenge-to-rival-s-pm-bid-is-spurned-14925948", "Source": "google"}
