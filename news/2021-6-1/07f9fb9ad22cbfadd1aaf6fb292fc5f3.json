They must exercise caution when carrying out works near water mains and ensure that adequate measures are in place to prevent damage.\"Under the Public Utilities Act, the penalty for damaging a water main or connecting pipe with a diameter of 300mm or more is a fine of up to S$200,000, up to three years in jail or both.Contractors who carry out works in the vicinity of water mains without an approved plan may be fined up to S$10,000.It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "MainKeyWord": "PUB,construction", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "URL": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/potable-water-main-damage-leak-fined-tong-shing-contractors-14924576", "Source": "google"}
