It described H10N3 as low pathogenic - less likely to cause death or severe illness - in birds.The man was stable and ready to be discharged from hospital. Medical observation of his close contacts had not found any other cases.The NHC said there had been no human cases of H10N3 previously reported in the world.H10N3 is a low pathogenic, or relatively less severe, strain of the virus in poultry and the risk of it spreading on a large scale was very low, the NHC added.The strain is \"not a very common virus\", said Filip Claes, regional laboratory coordinator of the Food and Agriculture Organisation's Emergency Centre for Transboundary Animal Diseases at the Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific.Only around 160 isolates of the virus were reported in the 40 years to 2018, mostly in wild birds or waterfowl in Asia and some limited parts of North America, and none had been detected in chickens so far, he added.Analysing the genetic data of the virus will be necessary to determine whether it resembles older viruses or if it is a novel mix of different viruses, Claes said.Several strains of bird flu have been found among animals in China but mass outbreaks in humans are rare.The last human epidemic of bird flu in China occurred in late 2016 to 2017, with the H7N9 virus.The H7N9 has infected 1,668 people and claimed 616 lives since 2013, according to the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organisation.Following recent avian flu outbreaks in Africa and Eurasia, the head of China's Centre for Disease Control and Prevention last week urged stricter surveillance in poultry farms, markets and wild birds.Covid-19 was first detected at a food and animal market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019.Join ST's Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.SPH Digital News / Copyright Â© 2021 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.
