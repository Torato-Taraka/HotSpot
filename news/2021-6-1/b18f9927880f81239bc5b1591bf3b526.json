By then, the two of them felt suspicious and wanted to cancel the loan.“The moneylender said we would need to pay a cancellation fee of S$3,000 and gave us an alternative where he would transfer S$300 (RM937) to us and we have to repay him S$200 (RM624) daily for three days.“We took the second option but on the fourth day, he threatened to splash paint at my friend’s house in Taman Johor Jaya, Johor Baru if we did not continue paying, so we transferred another S$200 to him.“After seeking advice from a policeman, we ignored the moneylender. However, on May 27, my friend’s house was splashed with red paint, which also damaged her front gate, porch and car.“The moneylender threatened to do more harm and asked for S$1,800 (RM5,625), which he said was inclusive of a fee to pay the runners who splashed paint at my friend’s house.“We also did as told out of fear for our family members’ safety, ” he said, adding that police reports have been lodged in Singapore and Malaysia.When contacted, Seri Alam OCPD Supt Mohd Sohaimi Ishak said a police report regarding the paint splashing incident was received on May 27 and investigations are ongoing under Section 427 of the Penal Code.Meanwhile, MCA national public complaints and services bureau deputy chief Chua Jian Boon, who organised the press conference, reminded the public not to get loans from illegal moneylenders or through social media that promised fast-track loan approvals.“With the total lockdown in place until June 14, I believe more people will face financial difficulties, which could lead to them asking for a loan from illegal sources or Ah Long.“It is best not to do so as such moneylenders usually have hidden charges or conditions to trap their victims, ” he said.\nTags / Keywords:\ninvestment\n                                                                ,\n                                                                                                losses\n                                                                ,\n                                                                                                illegal moneylender\n                                                                ,\n                                                                                                Singapore\n                                                                ,\n                                                                                                borrow money\n                                                                ,\n                                                                                                harassment\n\n\n\nReport it to us.Thank you for your report!Copyright © 1995-\n            \n\n Star Media Group Berhad (10894D)Best viewed on Chrome browsers.{{item['V1 Header']}}\n   {{item['V1 Body']}}\n\n  {{item['V2 Header']}}\n\nAre you having urinary troubles?
