In addition, we will continue to maintain stringent cost management.\"Turning to Sias' question of whether SIA would consider privatisation, the company said: \"Privatisation is not a matter for SIA to consider as it is a shareholder action. Accordingly, SIA is not in a position to comment.\"But analysts told The Straits Times that if privatisation were ever to be contemplated - which is unlikely - such an exercise could be done only with the approval of majority shareholder Temasek.SIA said it was grateful to all shareholders, including retail investors, for their strong support over the years and especially since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic.\"Our goal is to provide long-term value for shareholders by ensuring that the company returns to profitability and remains a leader in the airline industry as we navigate the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic,\" it said.SPH Digital News / Copyright © 2021 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.
