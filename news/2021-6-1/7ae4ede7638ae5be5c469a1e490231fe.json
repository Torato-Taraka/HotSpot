He wants Barca to think big,\" he said. - AFP, REUTERSGet The New Paper on your phone with the free TNP app. Download from the Apple App StoreÂ or Google Play Store now", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "URL": "https://www.tnp.sg/sports/football/aguero-joins-barcelona-more-follow", "MainKeyWord": "", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "Source": "google"}
