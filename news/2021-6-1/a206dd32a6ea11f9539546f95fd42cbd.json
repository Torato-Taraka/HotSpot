It added that egregious cases of suspected abuse would be referred to the police for further investigation.Iras added that thus far, no employer has been identified and referred to the police for suspected abuse of the Jobs Growth Incentive (JGI).Iras said it has an anti-gaming framework that harnesses data analytics and risk profiling to identify risks and prevent abuse. It has also set up a dedicated team to review the accuracy of CPF amounts for genuine employees based on actual wages paid.\"Iras will continue to review employers' eligibility for subsequent JSS and JGI payouts,\" it added.The agency warned that there are severe penalties for attempts to abuse the schemes. Other than having their payouts denied, employers can be jailed for up to 10 years and fined for cheating, under Section 420 of the Penal Code.Grace HoJoin ST's Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.SPH Digital News / Copyright Â© 2021 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.
