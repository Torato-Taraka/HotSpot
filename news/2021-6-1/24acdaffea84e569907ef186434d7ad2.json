This number declined to 233 in 2020, however, the decrease may have been a result of reduced road and pedestrian traffic due to the COVID-19 pandemic, MHA said.Silver Zones, introduced in 2014, are located in areas with a large population of senior citizens.These zones typically have a lower speed limit of 40kmh and additional traffic-calming and senior-friendly road safety features, such as additional crossing points and narrower lanes to slow down traffic.School Zones, which are demarcated areas fronting schools, also have enhanced road safety features, with a reduced speed limit of 40kmh during three time blocks on school days and whenever school events are in progress.It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "MainKeyWord": "Silver Zones,School Zones,traffic offences", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "URL": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/mha-traffic-offences-silver-zones-school-zones-fines-demerit-14924670", "Source": "google"}
