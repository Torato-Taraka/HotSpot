The footage shows Zainlai driving away from the scene.The victim, then 24, sustained an elbow fracture and multiple abrasions on his arms and legs. He was hospitalised for four days and given 50 days' hospitalisation leave.Deputy Public Prosecutor R. Arvindren said that the motorcycle was damaged with scratches and Zainlai did not make any compensation to the victim.He added that Zainlai was unremorseful as he denied being the driver of the van when the vehicle was tracked down.In mitigation, Zainlai asked for a lighter sentence as he had to care for his mother and three daughters who are still in school.For causing grievous hurt to the motorcyclist by a negligent act, Zainlai could have been jailed for up to two years or fined $5,000.For failing to help the injured motorcyclist, he could have been jailed for up to a year or fined $3,000.Join ST's Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.SPH Digital News / Copyright © 2021 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.
