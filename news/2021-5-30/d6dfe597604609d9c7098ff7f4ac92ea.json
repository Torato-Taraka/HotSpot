The white-spotted eagle ray is included in the 'catch-and-release' list,\" said Dr Tun.'NO FISHING' AREASTo protect Singapore's marine life and the more than 100 species of fish that can be found in Singapore's waters, certain 'No Fishing' areas have been designated for fish to flourish and grow to maturity, NParks said.These include areas such as the Sisters’ Islands Marine Park, Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve, Labrador Nature Reserve’s rocky shore, Chek Jawa Wetlands, and the waters around Coney Island Park.Offenders can be fined up to S$5,000 for fishing in ‘No Fishing’ areas in NParks-managed parks, and up to S$50,000 for fishing in nature reserves.NParks also works with other agencies to carry out joint enforcement operations in nature reserves and reservoirs to curb illegal fishing, it said.SUSTAINABLE FISHINGDr Tun said NParks has also worked with fishing communities and engaged anglers through community initiatives to promote responsible fishing and \"best practices for recreational fishing\".Members of the public who fish recreationally should also consider more sustainable methods of fishing, Dr Tun said.Each method of fishing - from the hook, rod and line to fish traps and nets, \"has their own characteristics and varies in their impact on the environment\", she explained.\"Fish traps and nets tend to be more indiscriminate, and when lost in the sea, will continue to trap and kill fish and other marine life.\"Nets that settle onto the seabed could also entangle corals or other bottom-dwelling organisms, and can smother them to death.\"For this reason, net fishing and the use of wire mesh traps are not allowed in areas managed by NParks,\" said Dr Tun.NParks also encourages catch-and-release fishing, where fish that are not going to be eaten are released back into the sea.\"Responsible fishing practices will help us maintain our rich biodiversity and will the population to continue to thrive,\" said Dr Tun.It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "MainKeyWord": "NParks,fishing", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "URL": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/nparks-white-spotted-eagle-ray-responsible-sustainable-fishing-14915116", "Source": "google"}
