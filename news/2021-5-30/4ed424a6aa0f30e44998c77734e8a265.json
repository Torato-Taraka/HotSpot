And I certainly would not want him to get into an accident because of the extra stress.With eateries closed and many people refraining from going out, delivery riders are essential in getting us our meals. While we stay safely at home, they are out on the road every day, rain or shine, and putting themselves at risk as they move between eateries and homes.You see many of them out on motorcycles, bicycles and even on foot, carrying what must be a heavy pack on their back. It is not easy work.But despite the pressures, many turned up looking cheerful and left with a friendly wish for me to enjoy my food before rushing off to their next delivery.So even if your meal arrives late, give the rider a smile or even make a joke about how long he must have waited for it to be ready.Let him know you understand and appreciate what he is doing. It will help to keep his spirits up - and yours too.If you have stories or pictures you would like to share about front liners in Singapore's fight against Covid-19, please e-mail stforum@sph.com.sgJoin ST's Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.SPH Digital News / Copyright Â© 2021 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.
