Once convicted, they will receive six months' imprisonment and a fine of HKUS$5,000.Hong Kong has one of the world’s strictest COVID-19 quarantine restrictions. Currently, crew members of aircraft and government officials are among those exempted from the compulsory quarantine.The Hong Kong government and financial regulators have previously warned the slow take up of vaccinations in the city could undermine its status as a financial centre.Around 1,319,725 people have received their first vaccination dose, around 20.1 per cent of the city's population.The total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Hong Kong is at 11,838, according to the Centre for Health Protection.Downloadour appor subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:https://cna.asia/telegramIt looks like the email address you entered is not valid.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "MainKeyWord": "COVID-19,coronavirus,Hong Kong,vaccine", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "URL": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/top-execs-hk-financial-firms-vaccinated-quarantine-exemption-14910302", "Source": "google"}
