Debate reached a fever pitch when two research teams in 2011 showed they could make bird flu transmissible between mammals.Harvard epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch told AFP he was concerned \"that it would create a strain of virus that if it infected a laboratory worker could not just kill that laboratory worker... but also cause a pandemic.\"\"The research is not required and does not contribute to the development of drugs or vaccines,\" added molecular biologist Richard Ebright of Rutgers University, one of the staunchest opponents of this kind of research.In 2014 the US government announced a pause in federal funding for such work, which gave way in 2017 to a framework that would consider each application on a case-by-case basis.But the process has been criticized as lacking transparency and credibility.As late as last year, a nonprofit received funding from the US on research to \"predict spillover potential\" of bat coronavirus to humans in Wuhan.Questioned by Congress this week, Francis Collins and Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health denied this amounted to gain of function research, but Ebright said it clearly does.- The path ahead -None of this means that Covid-19 definitely leaked from a lab -- in fact there is no hard scientific evidence in favor of natural origin or lab accident scenario, said Ebright.But there are certain lines of circumstantial evidence in favor of the latter. For instance, Wuhan is around 1,000 miles north of bat caves that harbor the ancestor virus, well out of the animals' flight range.Scientists from Wuhan were however known to be carrying out routine trips to those caves to take samples.Alina Chan, a molecular biologist from the Broad Institute, said there were no signs of risky pathogen research dying down in the wake of the pandemic -- in fact \"it's possibly expanded.\"Last year, Chan published research showing that, unlike SARS, SARS-CoV-2 was not evolving fast when it was first detected in humans -- another piece of circumstantial evidence that could point to lab origin.Chan considers herself a \"fence-sitter\" on the competing hypotheses, but does not favor banning risky research, fearing it would then go underground.One solution \"might just be as simple as moving these research institutes out into extremely remote areas...where you have to quarantine for two weeks before we re-enter in human society,\" she said.ia-la-pmh/dwA 95-year-old Singaporean woman died on Sunday (30 May) from COVID-19 infection, the Ministry of Health said on the same day.Sri Lankan authorities Sunday said they will sue the owners of a Singapore-registered cargo carrier which has burned for 11 straight days off the island's west coast and caused some of its worst-ever marine pollution.與人氣遊戲《集合啦！動物森友會》首度推出UT系列，讓島民於日常都可分享歡樂時光!British Prime Minister Boris Johnson married his fiancee Carrie Symonds in a \"secret ceremony\" on Saturday, UK media reports said.Gavin MacLeod, a veteran supporting actor best known for his role as an ever-smiling cruise ship captain on the 1970s-80s sitcom \"The Love Boat,\" died Saturday at the age of 90.Ukraine's ambassador to Thailand died early Sunday on the southern beach island of Koh Lipe while on vacation with his son, police said, with the cause of death still undetermined.成功申請可獲迎新獎賞高達$6,600「獎賞錢」，網上申請額外$100「獎賞錢」US President Joe Biden's administration announced Friday it will not return to the Open Skies Treaty, which Donald Trump withdrew from, signaling a toughening stance against Russia.The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Saturday (29 May) confirmed 33 new COVID-19 cases in Singapore, taking the country's total case count to 62,003.The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Sunday (30 May) confirmed the detection of 25 new cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore, taking the country's total case count to 62,028.All asset classes.
