Pregnant women will be able to register and book a vaccination appointment from 4 June, if they are part of the population group eligible for vaccination.Similarly, the two vaccines have been deemed to be safe for breastfeeding women and there is no need to stop breastfeeding while receiving the jabs, the EC19V said. Cancer patients on active cancer treatment remain at an increased risk of complications from COVID-19 but there was no evidence of any safety signals or increased rates of adverse events from mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, noted the authorities.Director of medical services Kenneth Mak noted that MOH had previously exercised \"considerable caution\" and advised that these patients complete their treatment before getting vaccinated. \"At this time, we prefer for these patients to be vaccinated in a hospital setting where they can be better monitored for their health status. And we will review later whether these conditions can be revised.\"Persons with Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions (SCAR), or sever skin allergy reactions to medications, can also receive both vaccines, even though they were previously not recommended to do so. SCAR includes Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis, Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms, and Drug-induced Hypersensitivity Syndrome.\"These are very severe reactions that occur as a result of taking various types of medications,\" explained Prof Mak. \"And if you have previously had such a severe allergic reaction to medications like antibiotics, you will now be eligible to receive your COVID-19 vaccination.\"The EC19V is also reviewing safety data on persons with a history of anaphylaxis, to allow more to be safely vaccinated, it added. The committee said it intends to complete the review in the next two weeks, and will set out guidelines allowing certain persons who have had previous history of anaphylaxis to be vaccinated using mRNA vaccines safely.Prof Mak said, \"We hope that these adjustments to our guidance will offer vaccination opportunities for more people and allow them to benefit from the enhanced immune protection that vaccination offers.\"Stay in the know on-the-go: Join Yahoo Singapore's Telegram channel at http://t.me/YahooSingaporeRelated stories:Possible easing of COVID restrictions after 13 June if community cases fall further: Lee Hsien LoongSingapore to make over-the-counter DIY COVID-19 tests available to residentsCOVID-19: Vaccination bookings for Singapore students to begin from 1 June400,000 students in Singapore can register for COVID vaccine from 1 June'Very unlikely' to resume Phase 3 straight after 13 June: Lawrence WongSingapore to allow alternative COVID-19 vaccines for use by private sectorHousehold members of close contact of COVID-19 case to be isolated immediately: PM LeeHousehold contacts of quarantined persons must self-isolate at home: MOHWe look at both industrial REITs to suss out which makes a better buy.
