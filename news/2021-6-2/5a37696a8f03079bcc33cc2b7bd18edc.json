We’re at a point where we’re only dealing with the obvious differences and much of the required texts have been drafted,” he said.Former US President Donald Trump unilaterally abandoned the nuclear deal in May 2018, levelling relentless waves of sanctions as part of his administration’s “maximum pressure” campaign on Iran.Efforts to restore the deal continue as Iran heads for its June 18 election, in which conservative judiciary chief Ebrahim Raisi is the frontrunner.The IAEA report on Monday also provided the first detailed insight into the ramifications of sabotage at Iran’s main nuclear facilities in Natanz – one of several over the past year – which the country blamed on Israel.The agency said Iran’s total stockpile of enriched uranium of various grades increased by an estimated 273kg (600 pounds) in the three months ending May 22, just over half the 525kg increase in the previous quarter.The power blackout at Natanz happened mid-way in that period, on April 11.Iran started enriching uranium up to a purity of more than 60 percent following the incident, its highest yet, prompting IAEA’s Grossi to call it “very concerning” last month. Iran’s stockpile of 60-percent enriched uranium now stands at just 2.4kg, according to the watchdog.But the IAEA also said Iran’s total stockpile is now estimated to be about 3,241kg, about 16 times higher than the permitted stockpile under the JCPOA, which also capped enrichment at 3.67 percent.A fifth round of dialogue to revive the 2015 Iran nuclear deal is under way in Vienna.The one-month extension gives negotiators in Vienna time to revive the nuclear deal from which the US withdrew in 2018.As US and Iran try to revive nuclear deal, experts warn about IAEA safeguards governing the frequency of inspections.Follow Al Jazeera English:", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "URL": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/6/1/iaea-highlights-complicated-iran-ties-as-nuclear-talks-continue", "MainKeyWord": "", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "Source": "google"}
