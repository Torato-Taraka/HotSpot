Does that leave the unvaccinated vulnerable? | Health Tips and  News", "Text": "﻿\nWe all know that the dreaded disease of Polio has been eliminated as an endemic disease in most developed and developing countries. Outbreaks have occasionally occurred in subsets of unvaccinated susceptible individuals. \r\nAccording to a paper published in the US National Library of Medicine, Infection in the intestinal tract with the vaccine strain of poliovirus results in virus shedding in the faeces and the risk that the contacts of a recipient might become infected.\r\nThe vaccine virus can revert to a virulent form, and this lends demonstrated biological plausibility to the finding that occasional contacts of vaccine recipients contract polio.\r\nThis means that all children in the vulnerable category need to be vaccinated otherwise exposure to the virus in this form that is shed through the faeces of the vaccinated children can turn the unvaccinated ones vulnerable.Are these fears applicable to the COVID-19 vaccination scenario?\r\nAre the vaccinated ones capable of transferring the COVID-19 disease to the unvaccinated ones?\r\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Communicable Diseases (CDC) says in a report:\r\nHow safe or vulnerable are the unvaccinated ones amidst the ones who have been already vaccinated against COVID-19? Will the vaccinated ones transmit the disease asymptomatically to the vulnerable ones?\r\nA growing body of evidence indicates that people fully vaccinated with an mRNA vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) are less likely to have an asymptomatic infection or to transmit SARS-CoV-2 to others. Studies are underway to learn more about the benefits of the Johnson & Johnson/Janssen vaccine.\r\nHowever, the risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection in fully vaccinated people cannot be completely eliminated as long as there is continued community transmission of the virus.\r\nAt this time, there are limited data on vaccine effectiveness in people who are immunocompromised. People with immunocompromising conditions, including those taking immunosuppressive medications, should discuss the need for personal protective measures after vaccination with their healthcare provider.\r\nThis updated science brief synthesizes the scientific evidence supporting CDC’s guidance for fully vaccinated people and will continue to be updated as more information becomes available.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention changed its guidelines about mask-wearing on May 13, 2021, it declared that anyone who is fully vaccinated can participate in indoor and outdoor activities, large or small, without wearing a mask or physical distancing.Anthony Fauci, the chief medical adviser to President Biden, said the new guideline is “based on the evolution of the science” and “serves as an incentive” for the almost two-thirds of Americans who are not yet fully vaccinated to go ahead and get the shot.Yet there remain some sections of the population who cannot be vaccinated for reasons other than vaccine hesitancy, such as:Vaccines are no guarantee against infection:\r\nThough the World Health Organisation demands vaccine efficacy of at least 50% before granting approval, the current lot of vaccines against COVID-19 has vastly outperformed expectations. For a vaccine to be effective, it doesn’t need to prevent the germ from infecting an immunized person. Vaccines train the body’s immune system, so when it actually encounters the disease-causing pathogen, it’s ready to mount an optimum response.Can a vaccinated person spread coronavirus?Immunology experts also work on the part of enabling a vaccinated person to transmit a lesser viral load after vaccination. But one cannot say for sure whether a vaccinated person does carry a lesser viral load by the virtue of having been vaccinated against COVID-19.This disease is new and poses a particular challenge because people with asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic infections can spread the disease – and insufficient contact tracing and testing mean those without symptoms are rarely detected.One thing that researchers have realised though is the fact that if a previously vaccinated individual does get sick with COVID-19 in what is called a “breakthrough infection,” – he or she manifests symptoms that are by far milder. People who test positive for COVID-19 after getting just their first vaccine dose are found to have lower levels of virus in their bodies than unvaccinated people who tested positive. This decreased viral load perhaps makes them less infectious as they have much fewer virus that could be spread to others.A preprint study that has not yet been peer-reviewed suggests that the Moderna mRNA COVID-19 vaccine can produce coronavirus-fighting antibodies in the oral and nasal fluid, reports The Wire. Since the SARS-CoV-2 enters the human body through the respiratory tract, antibodies in the mouth and nose should block the virus from getting into the body, effectively providing “sterilizing immunity.” Would this render the vaccinated people naturally unable to spread the virus through respiratory droplets? The jury is still out on that.\n\r\nMeanwhile, follow the COVID-appropriate SOPs even if you have been vaccinated. Wear the mask when in public or in the presence of anyone who is not quarantined with you, wash hands with soap and water often, maintain appropriate social distance, use sanitiser as and when necessary.Disclaimer: Tips and suggestions mentioned in the article are for general information purpose only and should not be construed as professional medical advice.
