Israeli media have speculated it could also court parliamentary backing from a party that draws votes from Israel's Arab minority.That has prompted Mr Netanyahu to accuse Mr Bennett of imperiling Israel as it contends with internal Jewish-Arab strife over last month's Gaza conflict, the moribund peace process with the Palestinians, and Iran.Mr Netanyahu, 71, is the dominant political figure of his generation. He was first elected prime minister in 1996 and he returned to power in 2009, holding the top office for more than a decade. But he also faces a corruption trial for bribery, fraud and breach of trust - charges he denies.A photo-shopped picture of Mr Bennett in an Arab headdress, circulated on social media, prompted comparisons with attempts to discredit former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, assassinated in 1995 by an ultranationalist opposed to his peacemaking.An Israeli security source said Mr Bennett had received parliamentary bodyguards on the recommendation of the Shin Bet domestic intelligence agency due to the \"atmosphere of incitement\" against them.Mr Lapid and Mr Bennett have said they want to bring together Israelis from across the political divide and end hateful political discourse.\"A country that is divided and violent won't be able to deal with Iran or with the economy. A leadership that incites us against one another harms our ability to deal with the challenges we face,\" Mr Lapid said.Join ST's Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.SPH Digital News / Copyright Â© 2021 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.
