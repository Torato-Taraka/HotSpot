It also has a substance that helps strengthen the immune response to the vaccine.When given the shot, the immune system identifies the inactivated virus as foreign and makes antibodies against it, which will then recognise the active virus and defend the body against it.Few people aged over 60 took part in the clinical trial of Sinovac's jab.However, the WHO said there should be no upper age limit on the vaccine as there is \"no reason to believe it has a different safety profile\" in older generations.The Sinovac jab is already in use in 22 territories around the world, according to an AFP count.Apart from China, the countries using Sinovac include Chile, Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, Thailand and Turkey.Chen Xu, China's ambassador in Geneva, said CoronaVac's EUL status expanded the number of global tools to fight the pandemic.\"China will continue to work with the international community to promote the accessibility and affordability of COVID-19 vaccines especially in (the) developing world,\" he said in a tweet.Downloadour appor subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:https://cna.asia/telegramIt looks like the email address you entered is not valid.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "MainKeyWord": "WHO,coronavirus,COVID-19,Sinovac", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "URL": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/who-approves-chinas-sinovac-covid-19-vaccine-14927834", "Source": "google"}
