Tanjong Pagar CC saw 21 such walk-ins by 1pm.One senior, 64-year-old Chua Ah Poh, said she missed her vaccination appointment in April because she had been unwell.The cleaner said she decided to go to the centre this afternoon to receive her jab after hearing PM Lee's pitch on Monday and also with encouragement from her family.She said in Mandarin: \"All my family members have received the vaccination, so I think it's better for me to get it as soon as possible to be safe and prevent anything from happening.\"\n\nMadam Lee Kwee Wah (left) did not want to take the vaccination previously but changed her mind after encouragement from her daughter.

But its not just that, we must also take preventive measures, such as going out less often and wearing a mask when going out. We have to take our life in our own hands.\"Mr Liew said he had cancelled his previous vaccination appointment because he was hospitalised at the time.He also encouraged other senior citizens to receive the vaccination, saying in Mandarin: \"I will encourage them to take the vaccination because it is safe and there is nothing to be afraid of.\"Join ST's Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.SPH Digital News / Copyright © 2021 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.
