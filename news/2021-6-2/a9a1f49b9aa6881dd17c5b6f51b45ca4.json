But Saar on Twitter said that he remained committed to \"replacing the Netanyahu regime\".Netanyahu in a video then called on Saar and Bennett to \"come now, immediately\" to meet him and join a three-way rotation government, warning that they were in a \"crucial moment for the security, character and future of the state of Israel\".Lapid's \"change\" coalition also still faced several obstacles.Some right-wing lawmakers object to a partnership with politicians from Israel's Arab minority, who make up about a fifth of the population.The recent Gaza conflict sparked inter-communal clashes between Jewish and Arab Israelis in mixed cities.Arab politicians have also been divided about joining a government headed by Bennett, who supports expanding Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, where Palestinians hope to create a state.Even with support from an Arab party, a new coalition in Israel is unlikely to reverse years of Israeli settlement construction or bring peace any time soon with Hamas in Gaza.If the anti-Netanyahu camp does not manage to form a government on time, a majority of 61 lawmakers could vote to ask the president to name a new premier.Another scenario would see the country return, yet again, to the polls.It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "MainKeyWord": "Israel,Benjamin Netanyahu,Yair Lapid,Naftali Bennett", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "URL": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/netanyahu-lapid-bennett-israel-inches-closer-government-14918206", "Source": "google"}
