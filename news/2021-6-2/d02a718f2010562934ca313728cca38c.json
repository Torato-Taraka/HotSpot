It's another adventure for Aguero after a decade at City, during which he became their all-time leading goalscorer with 260 goals in 390 games. \"We all know that BarÃ§a is the best team in the world, so it's a good decision to be here,\" Aguero told the club's official website. \"Hopefully I'll be able to help the team. I'm very happy.\" \"I want to send a big hug to everyone, to all the supporters I will try to give my best and hopefully the fans will enjoy my skills. They enjoyed me in other shirts but now I am here. I have changed a little bit. When I arrived in Europe to Atletico Madrid at 18 years old, I learned a lot, then I played for Manchester City in the Premier League.\" \"Now I have changed my way of playing, but I have an idea of where I can play and I will try to help my team-mates with my experience,\" he added.Lionel Messi (L) of Barcelona and Sergio Aguero of Manchester City during their Champions League clash at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, November 1, 2016. /CFPBarcelona hope Aguero's arrival helps convince his friend and fellow Argentine Lionel Messi to stay as the club captain is yet to sign an extension to his current contract which expires next month. \"Let's hope we play together ... what happens with Leo is down to decisions that he will make with the club,\" Aguero said. \"Obviously, it will be a pleasure if we play together.
