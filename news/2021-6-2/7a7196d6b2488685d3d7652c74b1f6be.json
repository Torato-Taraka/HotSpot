They were due to strong daytime heating of land areas, a convergence of winds over Singapore and the surrounding vicinity, or a combination of both factors, the Met Service said.The heaviest thundery showers during the month occurred on May 17 and May 18, particularly over the western and central parts of the island.On both occasions, a convergence of winds over Singapore and the surrounding vicinity brought thundery showers in the late morning, early afternoon and in the night.In May, the highest rainfall of 117.2mm was recorded on May 17 at Jurong West, while the highest daily total was 132.0mm, recorded at Toa Payoh.\"Climatologically, May is one of the warmest months of the year,\" said the Met Service.The highest daily maximum temperature recorded across the island was at least 34 degrees Celsius on 18 days, with the peak - 35.7 degrees Celsius - recorded at Marina Barrage on May 11.There were also a few warm nights where the night-time temperature was around 28 degrees Celsius, particularly over the south-eastern part of the island.Rainfall was slightly above average for most parts of Singapore in May. The highest rainfall anomaly of 69 per cent above average was recorded at Jurong. The anomaly was lowest at Kranji at 56 per cent below average.It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "MainKeyWord": "weather,Meteorological Service Singapore", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "URL": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/expect-warm-and-humid-nights-in-first-half-of-june-met-service-14926668", "Source": "google"}
