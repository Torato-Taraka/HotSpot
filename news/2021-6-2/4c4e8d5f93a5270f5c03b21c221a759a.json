Transfers with the Family Court will be operationalised at a later date.ENHANCED PROTECTIONSeveral changes to enhance protection for victims of harassment will also come into effect on Jun 1.Firstly, victims will face fewer hurdles to obtain protection orders. If a respondent has been convicted of any POHA or hurt-related offence against the victim, the requirement to show that a POHA provision has been contravened – which is necessary before a protection order can be granted – will be \"deemed satisfied\".\"Victims will not have to relive their experience more than necessary, to obtain protection,\" said the authorities.Secondly, judges granting expedited protection orders will be required to consider whether a criminal investigation is warranted, and if so, to refer cases to the police for investigation.People who have breached protection orders or expedited protection orders can also be arrested in prescribed scenarios, such as where hurt is caused.These changes are being introduced because in egregious cases of hurt or harassment, it may not be enough to grant the victim a civil remedy, said the authorities.Thirdly, protection orders and expedited protection orders will be further extended to protect people related to the victim, as they may also be harassed by the same perpetrator.It will also be made clear that domestic exclusion orders – which restrain the perpetrator from entering the victim's residence or parts of the residence – can be granted as part of a protection order.This will ensure better protection for victims who may stay in the same residence as the harasser, said the authorities.The establishment of the Protection from Harassment Court and the other amendments are provided for under the Protection from Harassment (Amendment) Bill 2019 passed by Parliament in May 2019.Minister for Law K Shanmugam said at the time the changes to the law were a \"crucial step\".\"The message is clear: It is unacceptable for perpetrators, the penalties are increased, toughened, the legal framework is even stricter, so even if it's a civil order, protection order, if you breach it, the police will come after you. It's an absolute no-no, not acceptable,\" Mr Shanmugam had said.\"For the victims, it's both that the law will protect you ... but also that we have to increase awareness, we have to make them understand that they don't need to be in such relationships, that they can walk out, that there is a system that will protect them.\"It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "MainKeyWord": "Protection from Harassment Court,Protection from Harassment Act,harassment,courts,Ministry of Law", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "URL": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/protection-from-harassment-court-act-victims-minlaw-14919528", "Source": "google"}
