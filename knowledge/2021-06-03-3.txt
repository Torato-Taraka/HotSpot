Southeast Asia's Largest Bank DBS Launches First Security Token Offering on Its Cryptocurrency Exchange.
 institutional or accredited investors signed up to the dbs digital exchange will be able to access secondary markets for dbs's digital bond.
singapore-based multinational banking corporation dbs bank has launched its first-ever security token offering by issuing a digital bond.
the dbs digital bond has been priced at $11.
35 million and comes with a six-month tenor and coupon rate of 0.
60% annually.
the offering was carried out through a private placement hosted by dbs digital exchange, or ddex, marking ddex's first sto.
to encourage investor engagement, the bond is set to be traded in board lots of 10,000 singapore dollars (roughly $7,560) â€” a dramatic reduction compared to the 250,000 singapore dollar board lots that traditional wholesale bonds are traded in.
the digital bonds will be available for secondary trading to clients of ddex who are accredited or institutional investors.
dbs hopes its offering will pave the way for other issuers to launch security token offerings via the ddex platform.
eng-kwok seat moey, the group head of capital markets at dbs, emphasized that security tokens offer an efficient and innovative method for raising capital in the asia-pacific region, which currently represents more than 30% of the global private equity markets.
he stated:since launching in december 2020, moey estimates daily volumes on ddex have increased by 900%, with the platform now servicing more than 120 traders.
dbs' crypto custody service also holds more than $60 million in assets.
the bank also launched a trust structure offering investment management services for bitcoin (btc), ether (eth), xrp and bitcoin cash (bch) speculators in early may.

dbs, southeast asia's largest bank, has launched its first security token offering (sto) on its cryptocurrency exchange.
the dbs digital bond is priced at 15 million singapore dollars.
"we expect asset tokenization to increasingly become more mainstream," said a dbs executive.
dbs announced monday its first security token offering (sto) on the dbs digital exchange (ddex).
the dbs digital bond, priced at 15 million singapore dollars (us$11.
37 million), comes with a six-month tenor and coupon rate of 0.
60% per annum.
it is offered as a private placement and dbs is the sole bookrunner for the transaction.
the bank detailed:this paves the way for other issuers and clients to tap on ddex's capabilities to efficiently access capital markets for their funding needs and sets the stage for more sto issuances and listings on ddex as asset tokenisation turns mainstream.
clifford lee, global head of fixed income at dbs, said that "this marks the first of many steps in the journey to evolve the traditional bond issuance into a broader digital ecosystem where more inclusive issuer and investor participation can be rapidly developed.
"lee continued: "while most bond tokenization exercises announced in asia to date tend to be repackaged forms of a conventional bond issue, the current transaction directly combines existing legal and tax infrastructure requirements with a direct issuance on the digital exchange in smaller lot sizes. "
the executive added:this bond token structure was only made possible because of the progressive development of singapore's legal and tax infrastructure, which can facilitate more sto issuances to broaden and deepen our capital markets.
eng-kwok seat moey, group head of capital markets at dbs, commented: "our maiden sto listing on the dbs digital exchange is a significant milestone .
.
.
this cements our ability to provide integrated solutions across the digital asset value chain, from deal origination to tokenization, listing, trading, and custody, which in turn opens the door for more stos on ddex. "
he emphasized:we expect asset tokenisation to increasingly become more mainstream as more of our clients start to embrace security token issuance as part of their capital fund raising exercise which we believe will boost singapore's ambitions to be a digital asset hub in asia.
the dbs digital exchange was launched in december last year.
it offers "exchange services between four fiat currencies (sgd, usd, hkd, jpy)" and four "cryptocurrencies, namely bitcoin, ether, bitcoin cash, and xrp," its website explains.
the bank disclosed in its first-quarter earnings call that its crypto exchange "enjoyed strong market traction since its launch. "
specifically, its "daily trading volumes have increased 10-fold from the initial week of launch, and the exchange currently serves over 120 participants.
dbs also holds over sgd 80 million in digital assets in its custodial service," the bank revealed.
in may, the bank launched a trust service for cryptocurrencies.

may 31, 2021 @ 10:49 am by omar faridi singapore-based dbs bank ltd (sgx:d05), a multinational banking and financial services corporation with over $330 billion in assets, revealed on monday (may 31, 2021) that it has priced a sgd 15 million (appr.
$11.
35 million) digital bond, which marks dbs digital exchange's (ddex) first security token offering as part of its efforts to provide a wide range of products.
the dbs digital bond, which has come with a six-month tenor and coupon rate of 0.
60% per annum, was carried out through a private placement.
dbs is reportedly the sole bookrunner for the transaction.
this transaction should help pave the way for other issuers and clients to leverage ddex's capabilities to gain access to capital markets for their funding requirements.
it may also lead to more security token issuances and listings on ddex as asset tokenization becomes more widely-adopted.
eng-kwok seat moey, group head of capital markets at dbs, said that digitalization through the issuance of security tokens offers a great opportunity for corporates looking for alternative platforms like ddex to raise capital from apac region's fast-evolving private capital markets.
at present, the asia-pacific region accounts for almost one-third or over 30% of the international private equity market, which reached a record $4.
73 trillion last year.
in order to encourage more participation from investors, the digital bond will reportedly be traded in board lots of sgd 10,000 (appr.
$7,560).
this is a considerably smaller denomination when compared to traditional wholesale bonds, which usually require investment and trading amounts that can be multiples of sgd 250,000. with this new listing of the digital bonds on ddex, the securities will be available for secondary trading to institutional and accredited investors who may be members or clients of ddex.
introduced in december of last year, ddex is part of an integrated crypto-asset ecosystem that utilizes blockchain or distributed ledger tech (dlt) to offer a secure and transparent platform to raise capital via the private market.
dbs stated that the ddex has seen strong market traction since it went live last year.
daily trading volumes have surged by as much as 10x from when the platform was first launched.
the exchange is now serving more than 120 participants.
dbs also holds more than sgd 80 million in crypto-assets in its custody services.
eng-kwok seat moey stated:"our maiden sto listing on the dbs digital exchange is a significant milestone, as it highlights the strength of our digital asset ecosystem in facilitating new ways of unlocking value for issuers and investors.
we expect asset tokenisation to increasingly become more mainstream as more of our clients start to embrace security token issuance as part of their capital fund raising exercise which we believe will boost singapore's ambitions to be a digital asset hub in asia.
"clifford lee, global head of fixed income at dbs, noted that this marks the first of many other steps as they work towards streamlining the bond issuance process.
lee added:"while most bond tokenization exercises announced in asia to date tend to be repackaged forms of a conventional bond issue, the current transaction directly combines existing legal and tax infrastructure requirements with a direct issuance on the digital exchange in smaller lot sizes.
