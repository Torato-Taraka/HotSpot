Police probing 10 cases of suspected abuse of JSS, Singapore News & Top Stories.
beijing: china's decision to allow families to have up to three children was met with scepticism on tuesday (jun 1), with doubts expressed on social media whether it would make much difference, and calls for details on what promised "supportive measures" will include.
on monday, beijing announced that it waslifting the two-child limitin an effort to encourage more child-bearing, weeks after census data confirmed rapid aging and a decline in fertility that puts china on track to see its population, the world's largest, begin shrinking.
the major policy shift will include supportive measures "conducive to improving our country's population structure", the official xinhua news agency said.
"i don't quite understand.
what's the meaning of supportive measures?
", asked one weibo user in a post that received more than 128,000 thumbs-up, the most popular comment on xinhua's post on the three-child policy.
social media participants cited the high cost of raising children in urban china, where housing can be expensive and children undergo private tuition in addition to public schools amid a fiercely competitive education system, as deterrents to having kids.
women in china already face a widening gender gap in terms of workforce participation and earnings, and have borne a growing share of childcare duties as state-supported childcare has declined, according to a report last year by the peterson institute for international economics.
"working women in the big cities will be further discriminated against, and it would be harder for women over 30s to find jobs," said another weibo user.
the xinhua readout from monday's politburo meeting chaired by president xi jinping said that in conjunction with the new policy china would lower educational costs, step up tax and housing support and guarantee the legal interests of working women, but did not give specifics.
james liang, a professor at peking university's school of economics and founder of online travel giant trip.
com, last month urged china to give parents of each newborn 1 million yuan to lift a fertility rate of just 1.
3 children per woman in 2020.  that rate is in line with countries such as japan and italy and far short of the 2.
1 replacement rate.
he said this week that china would need to spend about 5 per cent of gdp, compared with "practically 0 per cent now", in cash, tax breaks, housing subsidies, day care and other incentives in order to get the fertility rate up to about 1.
6, and expects the government soon to step up building day-care centres and kindergartens.
developed counties typically spend 1 per cent to 4 per cent of gdp on such support, he said.
"the one i'd really like to see is the housing subsidy, especially in large cities," he said.
"if the local government can return (land tax) or give discounts to couples with a third child or second child," it would be helpful, he said.
uptick and declinewhen china scrapped its one-child policy in 2016 there was a brief uptick in births followed by a decline that has steepened as costs continue to rise.
yi fuxian, a university of wisconsin scientist and longtime critic of chinese birth policy, said the decades-long one-child policy entrenched attitudes.
in japan, he noted, costly policies such as free childcare and education, housing subsidies for young couples and free medical care for kids helped lift the fertility rate from 1.
26 in 2005 to 1.
45 in 2015, only for it to drop to 1.
36 in 2019.
"having just one child or no children has become the social norm in china.
social and economic patterns cater to the one-child policy, so the inertial effects linger on," he said.
the global times, a nationalistic tabloid published by the ruling communist party's people's daily, acknowledged the difficulty of having three children in big cities but also said economics was not the only factor.
"it is equally important to change some habitual views of children and family values in a society with a declining birth rate, and to form new expectations and acceptability, as well as views on happiness," it said in an editorial.

ten cases of suspected abuse of the jobs support scheme (jss) are being investigated by the police.
in a statement released yesterday, the inland revenue authority of singapore (iras) said it has referred these cases to the police, and has also adjusted the payments for employers who readily corrected their erroneous employee central provident fund (cpf) contributions.
"some employers had chosen not to respond to iras' requests for clarifications, thus forgoing their payouts," it said.
examples of abuse it cited include employers making cpf contributions for non-genuine employees, inflating cpf contributions for employees without actual wage increases, and maintaining cpf contributions for employees on wage cuts.
iras also said that a small group of employers provided what seemed to be fabricated documents in an attempt to substantiate their eligibility for the scheme.
it added that egregious cases of suspected abuse would be referred to the police for further investigation.
iras added that thus far, no employer has been identified and referred to the police for suspected abuse of the jobs growth incentive (jgi).
iras said it has an anti-gaming framework that harnesses data analytics and risk profiling to identify risks and prevent abuse.
it has also set up a dedicated team to review the accuracy of cpf amounts for genuine employees based on actual wages paid.
"iras will continue to review employers' eligibility for subsequent jss and jgi payouts," it added.
the agency warned that there are severe penalties for attempts to abuse the schemes.
other than having their payouts denied, employers can be jailed for up to 10 years and fined for cheating, under section 420 of the penal code.

beijing: married chinese couples may have up to three children, china announced on monday (may 31), in a major shift from the existing limit of two after recent data showed a dramatic decline in births in the world's most populous country.
beijing scrapped its decades-old one-child policy in 2016, replacing it with a two-child limit to try and stave off risks to its economy from a rapidly aging population.
but that failed to result in a sustained surge in births given the high cost of raising children in chinese cities, a challenge that persists to this day.
the policy change will come with "supportive measures, which will be conducive to improving our country's population structure, fulfilling the country's strategy of actively coping with an ageing population", the official xinhua news agency said following a politburo meeting chaired by president xi jinping.
among those measures, china will lower educational costs for families, step up tax and housing support, guarantee the legal interests of working women and clamp down on "sky-high" dowries, it said, without giving specifics.
it would also look to educate young people "on marriage and love".
china had a fertility rate of just 1.
3 children per woman in 2020, recent data showed, on par with ageing societies like japan and italy and far short of the roughly 2.
1 needed for replacement level.
"people are held back not by the two-children limit, but by the incredibly high costs of raising children in today's china.
housing, extracurricular activities, food, trips, and everything else add up quickly," yifei li, a sociologist at nyu shanghai, told reuters.
"raising the limit itself is unlikely to tilt anyone's calculus in a meaningful way, in my view.
"zhang xinyu, a 30-year-old mother of one from zhengzhou, the capital of henan province, said the problem was that women bore most of the responsibility for raising children.
"if men could do more to raise the child, or if families could give more consideration for women who had just had children, actually a lot of women would be able to have a second child," she told reuters.
".
.
.
but thinking of the big picture, realistically, i don't want to have a second child.
and a third is even more impossible.
"in a poll on xinhua's weibo account asking #areyouready for the three-child policy, about 29,000 of 31,000 respondents said they would "never think of it" while the remainder chose among the options: "i'm ready and very eager to do so", "it's on my agenda", or "i'm hesitating and there's lot to consider".
the poll was later removed.
"i am willing to have three children if you give me 5 million yuan (us$785,650)," one user posted.
share prices in birth- and fertility-related companies surged.
"too late now"early this month, a once-in-a-decade census showed that the population grew at its slowest rate during the last decade since the 1950s, to 1.
41 billion, fuelling concerns that china would grow old before it gets wealthy as well as criticism that it had waited too long to address declining births.
"this is without a doubt a step in the right direction, but still it's a bit timid," shuang ding, chief economist at standard chartered in hong kong, told reuters.
"a fully liberalised birth policy should have been implemented at least five years ago, but it's too late now, although its better late than never," he said.
china's politburo also said on monday that it would phase in delays in retirement ages, but did not provide any details.
fines of 130,000 yuan (us$20,440) were being imposed on people for having a third child as of late last year, according to a government notice in the city of weihai.
fearing a population explosion, in 1979 china implemented its one-child policy, which succeeded in curbing population growth but also led to coerced sterilisations and sex-selective abortions that exacerbated a gender imbalance as many parents preferred male children.
a study published earlier this year by academics from hangzhou university found that the two-child policy encouraged wealthier couples who already had a child and were "less sensitive to child-rearing costs", while driving up the costs of child care and education and discouraging first-time parents.
su meizhen, a human resources manager in beijing, said she was "super-happy" to be pregnant with her third child.
"we won't have to pay the fine and we'll be able to get a hukou," she said, referring to the urban residence permit that enables families to receive benefits including sending their children to local public schools.

singapore a total of $85 million in jobs support scheme (jss) and jobs growth incentive (jgi) payouts for march 2021 has been withheld from 2,600 employers.
these employers will receive the payouts once the authenticity and accuracy of their information submitted are verified.
the payouts will be adjusted or denied if issues are found during the review, said the inland revenue authority of singapore (iras) in a statement on monday (may 31).
it said that about $52 million in jss payouts and $33 million in jgi payouts for march 2021 were withheld, pending employers' submission of supporting documents to iras to substantiate their eligibility.
these 2,600 employers make up about 2 per cent of all qualifying employers for the jss and jgi payouts.
the jss was introduced in february 2020 to help employers retain their local employees during the period of economic uncertainty brought about by covid-19.
under the scheme, the government co-funds a proportion of the first $4,600 of gross monthly wages paid to each local employee, with more help for sectors that are hardest hit.
the jgi was announced last august to support employers who accelerate their hiring of local workers, with more support for those who hire workers aged 40 and above, persons with disabilities, and ex-offenders.
iras' statement comes shortly after last friday's announcement by the ministry of finance (mof) that an $800 million support package including enhanced wage subsidies under the jss and rental relief will be rolled out to help businesses and workers cope with the impact of tightened covid-19 restrictions.
jss support will be increased to 50 per cent from may 16 to june 13 for firms in the food and beverage, performing arts and arts education, and sports sectors, from zero or 10 per cent during the april 1 to may 15 period.
these are firms that are required under the tightened measures to suspend many, if not all, of their operations, said mof.
sectors that are not required to suspend operations but are significantly affected will see wage support increased to 30 per cent.
these are firms in the retail sector, museums, art galleries, historical sites, cinemas, indoor playgrounds and other family entertainment centres.
the enhanced payout will be disbursed in september.
iras said that as at late may, it has concluded the review of more than 800 jss and close to 1,100 jgi payouts from the march 2021 tranche, with about $16 million in payouts denied under each scheme.
this corresponds to more than 500 and 800 employers who have had their march 2021 payouts denied for jss and jgi, respectively, it said.
total jss payouts denied since the scheme's inception are about $44 million.
iras also received around 500 reports from whistle-blowers on employers suspected to have abused the two schemes.

singapore: the inland revenue authority of singapore (iras) on monday (may 31) said that it has denied s$32 million in jobs support scheme (jss) and jobs growth incentive (jgi) payouts to 1,300 employers for march.
ten cases of suspected jss abuses have also been referred to the police for investigation, iras said in a media release.
about s$16 million in payouts was denied for each scheme, with 500 employers affected under the jss and 800 affected under the jgi.
overall, iras has withheld s$85 million from 2,600 employers for further checks for march payouts under the jss and jgi.
reviews have been concluded for more than 800 jss payouts and close to 1,100 jgi payouts for the tranche.
affected employers will have to submit supporting documents to iras to substantiate their eligibility for the schemes.
this is "part of iras' anti-gaming efforts to ensure that jss and jgi payouts are fairly and correctly disbursed", the authority said.
"these 2,600 employers make up about 2 per cent of all qualifying employers for the jss and jgi payouts," iras said.
"employers will receive their jss and jgi payouts once iras has verified the authenticity and accuracy of the information submitted.
"their payouts would be adjusted or denied if issues are found during the review.
"s$52 million of the withheld payouts fall under the jss while the remaining s$33 million are under the jgi.
the jss was introduced as part of the unity budget in february 2020 to provide wage support for employers to retain their local employees amid the covid-19 crisis.
all active employers, except for local and foreign government organisations and representative offices are eligible for the jss.
the jgi aids employers in expanding local hiring "so as to create good and long-term jobs for locals", iras said on its website.
it is available from september 2020 to september 2021. about s$44 million in jss payouts has been denied since the scheme was implemented.
suspected abusesin the process of reviewing the jss and jgi payouts, iras detected a variety of suspected abuses.
"examples include employers making central provident fund (cpf) contributions for non-genuine employees, inflating cpf contributions for employees without actual wage increases and maintaining cpf contributions for employees on wage cuts," it said.
"iras has adjusted the payments for employers who readily corrected their erroneous employees' cpf contributions.
some employers had chosen not to respond to iras' requests for clarifications, thus forgoing their payouts.
"a small group of employers had provided what appeared to be fabricated documents in an attempt to substantiate their eligibility for the scheme.
"iras has referred 10 cases to the police for investigation.
"egregious cases of suspected abuse would be referred to the police for further investigations," the authority said.
police are currently looking into the 10 referred cases which all come under the jss.
"iras has a robust anti-gaming framework that harnesses data analytics and risk profiling to identify risks and prevent abuse," the authority said.
"a dedicated team has also been established to review the accuracy of cpf amounts for genuine employees based on actual wages paid.
"iras will continue to review employers' eligibility for subsequent jss and jgi payouts.
"iras added that it has received about 500 reports from whistleblowers on suspected jss and jgi abuses by employers.
employers who abuse these schemes may be liable for the offence of cheating, and may face up to 10 years in prison and a fine.

china is relaxing its family planning policy to allow couples to have up to three children/afpchina has relaxed its family planning policy to allow couples to have a maximum of three children after a census showed its population is rapidly ageing, state media xinhua reported monday.
for almost 40 years, china enforced a controversial "one-child policy" â one of the strictest family planning regulations worldwide â which was lifted in 2016 due to widespread concerns over an ageing workforce and economic stagnation.
"to actively respond to the ageing of the population .
.
.
a couple can have three children," xinhua said, citing a monday meeting of china's elite politburo leadership committee hosted by president xi jinping.
despite government efforts to encourage childbirths, china's annual births have continued to plummet to a record low of 12 million in 2020, the national bureau of statistics said last month.
china's fertility rate stands at 1.
3 â below the level needed to maintain a stable population, the bureau revealed.
the once-in-a-decade 2020 census results published last month also showed that china's population grew at its slowest rate since the 1960s, reaching 1.
41 billion.
it comes alongside a sharp drop in the number of working-age people, once again raising fears of a looming demographic crisis.
china's gender balance has also been skewed by decades of the one-child policy, and a traditional social preference for boys which prompted a generation of sex-selective abortions and abandoned baby girls.

firstly, the adaptability of a location for remote working was examined, calculating the percentage of jobs that were classified as 'teleworkable' in each city.
next, the overall work intensity of a city was assessed, based on a series of factors related to overworking, holiday allowance, and parental leave.
next, kisi researchers looked into the amount of covid-related economic support residents receive in each location.
to determine the extent to which different types of individuals in a city receive equal treatment, access to state-funded health and welfare programs was also measured, as well as institutional support for gender equality and social inclusivity of minorities and the lgbt+ community.
each city's livability score was then appraised by examining its affordability as well as citizens' overall happiness, safety, and access to wellness and leisure venues.
finally, kisi looked into the effect of the pandemic on a city's work-life balance in several key areas case numbers, the severity of lockdown measures, and economic losses which were combined to determine an overall 'covid impact' score.
