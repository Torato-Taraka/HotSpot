Zinedine Zidane accuses president Florentino Perez of lacking respect in letter to Real Madrid fans.
date published: tuesday 1st june 2021 11:53               samuel bannister carlo ancelotti has emerged as a leading candidate to return to real madrid, and everton have reportedly already got their eyes on a replacement.
ancelotti guided everton to a 10th-placed finish in the premier league in his first full season at goodison park.
he took over midway through the 2019-20 campaign and has overseen some progress.
struggles at home have blotted his record but everton remain happy to continue with such a high-profile manager.
however, the issue may be taken out of their hands.
reports last month suggested their owners were fearful that real madrid or barcelona could try to appoint him, and those fears may be growing now.
according to cadena ser, madrid have indeed been in touch with ancelotti.
he used to manage them between 2013 and 2015, winning four trophies.
zinedine zidane recently confirmed his resignation and madrid have since been scrambling for a replacement.
the likes of antonio conte and mauricio pochettino, both also targets for tottenham, have been linked.
but ancelotti is moving up the shortlist and could get the chance to return to the bernabeu.
his entourage have suggested it would be impossible to refuse real if they firmed up their interest.
they would have to negotiate with everton, but there could be a willingness for the deal to go through.
that might even be today, as marca claim it could become official within the next few hours.
in addtion, as claim that everton are already weighing up potential successors to ancelotti.
one name who could be considered is nuno espirito santo, who has apparently been offered to them.
nuno recently left wolves after a four-year spell, but shouldn't be out of work for too long.
his agent jorge mendes is trying to find him a new club and may have been in contact with everton.
the former rio ave, valencia and porto boss will be in demand and has shown what he can do in the premier league.
therefore, he would be an interesting candidate for everton to consider.

sergio aguero will join barcelona on a free transfer following his departure from manchester city.
the 32-year-old underwent a medical at camp nou on monday before signing a two-year contract with the blaugrana.
barca moved for aguero after city's decision to let the striker go at the end of his contract, bringing to an end his trophy-laden ten-year spell in manchester.
barca have said in a statement on their official website: "fc barcelona and sergio 'kun' aguero have reached an agreement for the player to join the club from 1 july when his contract with manchester city expires.
"the player will sign a contract until the end of the 2022-23 season and his buy out clause is set at 100 million euros.

com/tdiaxfswt9barca took the decision to sell star striker luis suarez to atletico madrid last summer without signing a replacement, which left lionel messi shouldering the main goalscoring burden for the team in 2020-21. ronald koeman's men were able to achieve success in the copa del rey, but fell short in the champions league and la liga, with atletico ultimately clinching their first title since 2013-14 thanks to suarez's prolific form in the final third.
barca will hope that aguero can have a similar impact next season, despite the fact that the argentine struggled for form and fitness during his final campaign at etihad stadium.
aguero is set to link up with his international team-mate and close friend messi at camp nou, and they will be expected to strike up a strong partnership as the blaugrana aim to return to elite level on both domestic and european fronts.

the experienced frontman, who initially moved to the etihad for ¬£35 million ($50m) from atletico in 2011, hit 260 goals in 390 matches across all competitions for city becoming their all-time record scorer in the process.
aguero signed off in the premier league with a trademark double in a 5-0 thrashing of everton on the last day of the season, but suffered heartbreak in his final outing for pep guardiola's side as they lost 1-0 to chelsea in their first-ever champions league final appearance.

liverpool idol jamie carragher sprung a surprise on everton when he urged the toffees to replace carlo ancelotti with another reds favourite, rafa benitez.
carragher worked under benitez for the entirety of the spaniard's six-year spell in charge at anfield, winning the champions league in 2005.  while there is no love lost between the two fierce merseyside rivals, the ex-england defender believes his former mentor would be a perfect fit at goodison park.
"as carlo ancelotti returns to real madrid, everton owner farhad moshiri will be wondering when he will next get the chance to appoint a former real madrid manager and champions league winner with premier league experience," carragher wrote in the telegraph.
"how about immediately?
of the names instantly linked with everton as the ancelotti news broke, who is more qualified than my former liverpool boss rafa benitez?
"rafa is available, settled in the area and i am sure he is ready if moshiri is prepared to consider one of the more shocking managerial appointments in merseyside football history.
"at the very least, benitez should be under consideration as moshiri begins yet another managerial quest.
not for the first time, before the owner decides the right candidate, he has to be clear of the football direction he wants to take.
"with ancelotti, everton pursued the tried-and-tested, proven experienced manager and stellar name.
if that is what moshiri still wants, benitez is an obvious candidate.
"ancelotti said farewell to everton on tuesday after just over 18 months in charge as he resigned in order to begin a second spell at the helm of real madrid.
having taken over in december 2019 with the toffees languishing in 18th place in the premier league, the italian helped them to recover to 12th by the end of his debut season and clinched 10th in the last campaign which finished in may.
despite that improvement, there was a feeling that everton should have been aiming higher, having led the table after six games and spending most of the first half of the season inside the top six.
benitez, meanwhile, has been out of work since january after cutting short his time at china's dalian professional for personal reasons.

madrid (reuters) carlo ancelotti returned to real madrid for a second spell as coach on tuesday (june 1), re-joining the club from everton, after agreeing a three-year deal at the bernabeu.
the italian was previously in charge of real between 2013 and 2015, and replaces zinedine zidane, who left the la liga club last month.
"while i have enjoyed being at everton i have been presented with an unexpected opportunity which i believe is the right move for me and my family at this time," ancelotti said in a statement on the everton website.
ancelotti has one of the most-decorated cvs in world football and won the champions league with real in 2014, helping the spaniards to their fabled 'decima' (10th) european crown, before being sacked 12 months later.
the 61-year-old is one of three coaches, along with former liverpool manager bob paisley and zidane, to have won the european cup or champions league on three occasions, having also led ac milan to glory in 2003 and 2007. his honours list includes league titles in four different countries at milan, chelsea, paris st germain and bayern munich over a 26-year managerial career.
"carlo ancelotti will be the new first team coach for the next three seasons," a brief real madrid statement read.
ancelotti will sign his contract and be presented to the media on wednesday.
the move comes following zidane's decision to step down five days after his team were pipped to the la liga title by city rivals atletico madrid.
real finished two points behind atletico, were knocked out of the champions league in the semi-finals by eventual winners chelsea and suffered a humiliating copa del rey exit to third division minnows alcoyano during a rare trophy-less season.
zidane subsequently hit out at the club in an open letter, saying: "i'm leaving because i feel the club no longer has the faith in me i need, nor the support to build something in the medium or long term. "
it brought an end to a second spell in charge of the club that was fraught with tension.
the end of the frenchman's tenure was surrounded by questions over his reliance on players the wrong side of 30 like luka modric, toni kroos and karim benzema and his willingness to oversee the rebuild the club felt it needed.
ancelotti was considered something of a coup when everton announced his appointment on a four-and-a-half year contract in december 2019, and he guided the club to a 12th-place premier league finish in his first season.
the italian then oversaw an impressive summer transfer window, signing colombian star james rodriguez from real madrid as well as the likes of allan, abdoulaye doucoure and ben godfrey, and everton started the campaign in superb form, winning their first seven games in all competitions.
the toffees remained in european contention throughout the season but a dip in form towards the end of the campaign, when they picked up three wins from their final 12 league games, saw them slide to a disappointing mid-table finish.
"the club will begin the process of appointing a new manager immediately and will provide updates in due course," read an everton statement.

madrid: carlo ancelotti returned to real madrid for a second spell as coach on tuesday (jun 1), re-joining the club from everton, after agreeing a three-year deal at the bernabeu.

editions:en/football/real-madridsanti siguero gives his opinionthe youngest will not remember it, because they did not suffer from it, but carlo ancelotti began to make his mark in the history of real madrid in the spring of 1989.  carletto was then a struggling midfielder for arrigo sacchi's ac milan, and he opened the scoring in the greatest mockery suffered by los blancos in the european cup: ac milan's 5-0 win at stadio san siro in the 1988/89 season.
there were other defeats in the history of real madrid, comparable in quantitative terms, but that one was especially cruel because it buried the quinta del buitre, a generation of footballers who skirted the seventh european cup but failed several times, although never in such a way raw like that night in milan.
ancelotti beat francisco buyo at the san siro and opened a wound that took a decade to heal, until predrag mijatovic scored past angelo peruzzi at the amsterdam arena in may 1998.  the septima was long overdue, but also the decima: from zinedine zidane's volley in glasgow to sergio ramos' unstoppable header in lisbon.
at the time, ancelotti was on real madrid's bench at the estadio da luz, after coming to the club at the beginning of the season to facilitate the digestion of the intense jose mourinho era.
the portuguese brought real madrid closer to the champions league, but it was the italian who grabbed it by both ears, with a real madrid so different from the current one that it is dizzying to remember.
cristiano ronaldo at his best, a gareth bale who still prioritised the big ball over the golf ball, angel di maria's crosses, xabi alonso's passes, a sergio ramos more aware of football than yucatan, el hormiguero and renewals, with marcelo and isco (the ones who changed the flow of that final in the capital of portugal) initiating the ascent to the peak of their careers.
other times, another football.
another real madrid.
that champions league success, preceded by the copa del rey after the derailment of marc bartra against the express train called bale at mestalla, heralded a glorious 14/15 season.
and it could have been one, but luka modric got injured and left real madrid without a compass, with a recently landed toni kroos, with the shock of xabi alonso's escape to bayern munich, with manchester united's blank cheque to di maria, and real madrid lost their way in the fight for laliga santander with two defeats at san mames and camp nou after leading the table for 15 matchdays.
still, it was the european elimination that buried carletto.
a surplus real madrid (that won 3-0 against liverpool at anfield and chicharito's goal to eliminate atletico madrid in the quarter-finals) was defeated by juventus with two goals from alvaro morata, one in turin and the other in madrid, and forever left the doubt of whether real madrid had been able to win five champions league titles in a row, like alfredo di stefano's team, because then zidane's three successful champions league runs arrived.
nobody would have said it in 2015, but zidane is now the past and carlo is the future of real madrid.
now the question is to know if his 'soft hand' will serve to stiffen a team and a club that is more ready for a revolution than for good vibes, a positive mood and cigarettes.

															afp paris: rafael nadal began his bid for a record-setting 21st grand slam title with a straight sets win at the french open on tuesday as the fallout from naomi osaka's revelations over depression and anxiety sent shockwaves through roland garros.
nadal, the 13-time champion in paris, defeated 63rd-ranked alexei popyrin of australia 6-3, 6-2, 7-6 (7/3) to take his record at the tournament to 101 wins against just two losses.
"i was lucky to win that third set, i don't know how (i did).
the beginning of the match had been very tough too," said nadal, who had been 2-5 down in the third set, saving two set points.
"in these warm and fast conditions it's always very difficult.
he's young and the speed of his ball is very strong.
"up next is fellow 34-year-old richard gasquet.
the pair first played one another when they were children.
as professionals, nadal leads 16-0. the spaniard's opening win shifted the emphasis onto world number one, and potential semi-final opponent, novak djokovic who is chasing a second french open title and 19th grand slam.
djokovic was taking on 66th-ranked tennys sandgren of the united states in an evening session match-up.
world number one ashleigh barty marked her return to paris for the first time since her 2019 title triumph by beating american left-hander bernarda pera 6-4, 3-6, 6-2 but admitted she was fighting a hip problem.
barty, 25, skipped the defence of her title in 2020 due to the pandemic but this year has won trophies at the yarra valley classic, miami and on clay in stuttgart in the run-up to roland garros.
after easing through the first set on court philippe chatrier, barty went off the boil in the second and called for the trainer at the changeover.
"i'm not going to hide behind the fact i'm not quite 100%," said barty whose left thigh was heavily strapped.
"but i can guarantee that i will go out there with the right attitude every day and be really accepting of that and give it a crack no matter what.
"meanwhile, the fallout from osaka's withdrawal continued to be felt.
the 23-year-old world number two, and four-time major winner, pulled out on monday after she was fined $15,000 and threatened with disqualification for refusing to attend press conferences.
osaka claims traditional post-match media conferences are akin to "kicking people when they're down" and were having a detrimental effect on her mental health.
she revealed she had been suffering bouts of depression since her 2018 us open title breakthrough as well as anxiety attacks.
her decision attracted widespread sympathy and accusations over the role of the media in the affair.
"there's a sense of voyeurism around how it presently works," wrote peter terry, a professor of psychology at the university of southern queensland in australia on theconversation.
com.
"perhaps some want to see athletes crumble and break down into tears, having put them on a pedestal.
"osaka is a young, introverted, anxious person.
we should by now understand that sports stars are not super human, that they have the same doubts and mental health issues as everyone else.
"ironically, another roland garros press conference led tuesday to the injury-enforced withdrawal of two-time wimbledon champion petra kvitova.
the czech 11th seed, a roland garros semi-finalist in 2012 and 2020, had saved a match point in her first-round win over belgian qualifier greet minnen on sunday.
"during my post-match press requirements on sunday i fell and hurt my ankle.
unfortunately, after an mri and much discussion with my team, i have made the tough decision that it would be unwise to play on it," said the 31-year-old.
fifth seed elina svitolina, a three-time quarter-finalist, recovered from a 2-5 second set deficit to beat french teenager oceane babel 6-2, 7-5. italian 37-year-old andreas seppi, playing in his 63rd successive grand slam, stunned 20th seeded felix auger-aliassime 6-3, 7-6 (10/8), 4-6, 6-4. for seppi, it was a first win at any level this year.
venus williams, playing the tournament for the 24th time and a runner-up 19 years ago, saw her 89th grand slam end at the first hurdle as russia's ekaterina alexandrova eased to a 6-3, 6-1 win over the 40-year-old american.

barcelona's new signing sergio aguero believes his argentinian compatriot lionel messi will be staying at the nou camp.
the 32-year-old striker, who signed on a free transfer from manchester city, said he hoped to play alongside messi, whose contract expires this month.

five years after an exile from the france national team, karim benzema said he is looking to put the past behind him and his only focus is on leading the line for didier deschamps' side at the june 11-july 11 european championship.
benzema, who has scored 30 goals in all competitions for real madrid this season, has not played for france since 2015, after a blackmailing scandal over which he faces a trial in october.
the 33-year-old also said in 2016 that deschamps had "bowed to the pressure of a racist part of france" when leaving the forward out of the euros squad that year but got a surprise call-up for the delayed euro 2020.
"what happened has happened.
there are always regrets, we cannot turn back, we can just change from the past," benzema, who has 27 goals in 81 games for france, told reporters on sunday.
"the most important thing is what happens on the ground.

now i'm focused on the game and trying to show the best on the pitch.
"benzema will team up with 22-year-old kylian mbappe, who led france to the world cup title in 2018 and the striker praised his younger teammate.
"i do not like to compare, (mbappe) is still a young player, a phenomenon," benzema said.
"i have already been able to train with him.
we play with one touch, he has good movement, he has a lot of speed and has skill in front of goal.

sergio aguero says he has wanted to join barcelona since he was a child and did not hesitate to accept their offer.
the argentina international had been linked with a move to camp nou for months before signing a contract with the club on monday after leaving manchester city.
the striker says it has been his dream since the age of 14 to join barca and is delighted to make the return to spain.
"i am very happy, i will try to do my best for the club, help the team win important things.
it is an immense joy," he said at a press conference following his unveiling as a barcelona player.
"for me, barca has always been the best team in the world and leo [messi] is also there.
"i told [president joan] laporta before that as a boy i said: 'one day they will surely notice me. '
and here i am.
i didn't imagine it, but anyone runs to sign for barca.
"he added: "when barca asked about me, i didn't even hesitate.
i told my agent that i didn't want him to talk to another team, only barca.
"it was an immense joy when they contacted my agent.
i've been interested since i was 14 years old.
"the 32-year-old's arrival at camp nou could see him play alongside his national team-mate messi.
but the six-time ballons d'or winner could still leave the club this summer when his contract expires.
but aguero hopes messi decides to stay and is optimistic about the chances of that happening.
"we hope to play together, of course.
but we have been negotiating for a long time, these are decisions that leo will make with the club.
it will be a pleasure and pride to play together.
"i have known him for a long time and i think he will stay.

we have known each other for a long time and for me playing now and training with him every day is going to be much easier.
"the former atletico madrid star has signed a contract that runs until summer 2023. the club have set his release clause at ‚Ç¨100 million (¬£86m/$122m).
date published: tuesday 1st june 2021 11:53               samuel bannister carlo ancelotti has emerged as a leading candidate to return to real madrid, and everton have reportedly already got their eyes on a replacement.
ancelotti guided everton to a 10th-placed finish in the premier league in his first full season at goodison park.
he took over midway through the 2019-20 campaign and has overseen some progress.
struggles at home have blotted his record but everton remain happy to continue with such a high-profile manager.
however, the issue may be taken out of their hands.
reports last month suggested their owners were fearful that real madrid or barcelona could try to appoint him, and those fears may be growing now.
according to cadena ser, madrid have indeed been in touch with ancelotti.
he used to manage them between 2013 and 2015, winning four trophies.
zinedine zidane recently confirmed his resignation and madrid have since been scrambling for a replacement.
the likes of antonio conte and mauricio pochettino, both also targets for tottenham, have been linked.
but ancelotti is moving up the shortlist and could get the chance to return to the bernabeu.
his entourage have suggested it would be impossible to refuse real if they firmed up their interest.
they would have to negotiate with everton, but there could be a willingness for the deal to go through.
that might even be today, as marca claim it could become official within the next few hours.
in addtion, as claim that everton are already weighing up potential successors to ancelotti.
one name who could be considered is nuno espirito santo, who has apparently been offered to them.
nuno recently left wolves after a four-year spell, but shouldn't be out of work for too long.
his agent jorge mendes is trying to find him a new club and may have been in contact with everton.
the former rio ave, valencia and porto boss will be in demand and has shown what he can do in the premier league.
therefore, he would be an interesting candidate for everton to consider.

home  all the news  aguero was the 'worst trainer' at city, says ex-teammatedate published: monday 31st may 2021 10:44                 lewis oldham micah richards has claimed that sergio aguero was the "worst trainer" at man city, but it was "game over" when it came to his finishing.
richards was still a key part of city's defence when aguero joined the club in 2011 for around ¬£35m.
the forward made an instant impact as he shone during his debut season in the premier league.
he scored the vital goal that secured them the title on the final day of the campaign.
if solskjaer is sacked then guardiola must go too.
.
.
over the years, aguero has established himself as one of man city's greatest ever players.
he scored 260 goals for them from his 390 outings across all competitions.
the striker's contract with city expired at the end of the season and he has now joined barcelona on a two-year deal.
richards has told bbc sport that at times, aguero would not "even have his boots tied up" for training:"from the moment he came through the door, you are in awe.
you have that feeling of 'wow'.
the only other time i had that was when robinho came through the door.
for us growing up, shaun goater or nicolas anelka was a big thing ‚Äì so when aguero comes, you can't believe this is happening.
"he was the worst trainer in the history of training.
he had that laid-back style.
aguero would just walk around.
sometimes he wouldn't even have his boots tied up.
but the moment it came to the finishing, it was game over.
i thought he was going to be sensational but when i trained with him i thought 'have we made a mistake here?'
i thought tevez was better ‚Äì but then he makes his debut.
.
.
"the fans just erupted when he came on and it was like a genuine superstar here.
you can't write it and from them i knew we had signed a player.
"i was there for four years with him.
with aguero, you don't associate him with being a superstar in terms of how he was off the pitch.
he was the most humble person ever. "
"if he continues [at barcelona], which i think he will, i will try to give everything as he has always done. "
barcelona have announced the signing of sergio aguero on a free transfer from man city.
sergio aguero wants lionel messi's future to be sorted before he joins spanish giants barcelona.
do man city even need a replacement for sergio aguero?
they have gabriel jesus.
"it's like 'you don't have to be so emotional'.
if you want him, just keep him. "
aguero will leave manchester city after saturday's champions league final.
real talk: whoever england leave out today wouldn't have made much difference anyway.
there is something about alexander-arnold not being called up by england which causes some to lose their minds.
blackpool took a different approach to league one promotion by following a more german route.
leeds and aston villa both have two representatives in a list that includes a lot of frenchmen.

barcelona: barcelona on tuesday (jun 1) confirmed that manchester city defender eric garcia would join them on jul 1 when his contract with the premier league champions expires.
garcia will return to his boyhood club on a deal until the end of the 2025-26 campaign after three years at city and follows striker sergio aguero in making the switch from manchester to the camp nou.
barca said they had included a ‚Ç¨400 million (us$489.
52 million) buyout clause in the 20-year-old garcia's contract.
the defender was limited to 12 matches in all competitions during the 2020-21 season due to injuries and illness.
he is set to be unveiled at the camp nou later on tuesday.
argentine striker aguero, who will officially join barca on a two-year deal on jul 1, said he hoped to play alongside compatriot lionel messi.
messi, who is godfather to aguero's son, will see his contract expire this month and there has been no news of an extension.
"i hope we can play together," aguero told reporters.
"but the thing with leo is that he'll make decisions with the club.
i've been with him since a kid with the national team, i know him very well, and think he'll stay here.
"messi requested to leave barca last year and was linked with a move to city or paris st germain but opted to stay for another season.
he was given permission by head coach ronald koeman to miss their final la liga match of the season and take holiday.

barcelona unveiled the first of their summer signings yesterday with confirmation that manchester city striker sergio aguero will join the club on july 1, when his contract with the losing champions league finalists expires.
the argentina international joined city from spanish side atletico madrid in 2011 and went on to become the english club's all-time leading goalscorer, netting 260 times as he helped them claim five english premier league titles, including this season's crown.
barca said the 32-year-old will sign a two-year deal, with a 100 million euro (s$161.
6m) buy-out clause.
aguero is expected to be the first of several arrivals at the nou camp this summer as new president joan laporta looks to revamp a squad that finished third in la liga.
they have also reached the champions league semi-finals only once since they last won the continental crown in 2015. aguero's city teammate eric garcia has been heavily linked as a transfer target by local media, as have lyon's memphis depay and liverpool's georginio wijnaldum.
italian journalist fabrizio romano tweeted that the deals involving free agents garcia and wijnaldum will be announced once medicals are completed.
he added that garcia, 20, is expected to sign a five-year deal, while wijnaldum, 30, will get a three-year contract.
real betis' brazilian right-back emerson, 22, will also be part of the barca revamp.
barca will be hoping that the summer arrivals can convince lionel messi to stay.
the argentinian star, whose contract expires at the end of this month, has yet to sign a new deal, but laporta said last friday that talks are "going well".
"it's about building a team with the possibility of winning everything.
he wants barca to think big," he said.

madrid: zinedine zidane said on monday he had stepped down as real madrid coach as the club's hierarchy did not have enough faith in him to rebuild an ageing squad.
zidane, who returned to real for a second spell in charge in march 2019, won two la liga titles and three champions league crowns during his two stints as coach.
however, he stepped down last week after real suffered their first trophyless season in 11 years, finishing second in la liga, being knocked out of the champions league semi-finals and suffering a humiliating copa del rey exit in the round of 32 to third division minnows alcoyano.
in an open letter published in sports daily as, zidane said the first time he left as coach in 2018 was because he felt the team needed a new approach to stay at the highest level after enjoying so much success.
"right now, things are different," he said.
"i'm leaving because i feel the club no longer has the faith in me i need, nor the support to build something in the medium or long term.
"zidane also suggested that his relationship with the club president had changed in recent weeks, and hit out at the series of leaks and stories about his future coming from within real.
"i would have liked my relationship with the club and the president over the past few months to have been a little different to that of other coaches," he added.
"i wasn't asking for privileges, of course not, just a little more recollection.
"it hurt me so much when i read in the press, after a defeat, that i would be sacked if i didn't win the next game.
"it hurt me and the whole team because these deliberately leaked messages to the media negatively influenced the squad, they created doubts and misunderstandings.

madrid, may 31 ‚Äî  zinedine zidane resigned as real madrid manager because he felt the spanish club no longer had any confidence in him, he wrote in an open letter today.
"i'm leaving because i feel the club no longer has the faith in me i need, and doesn't offer me the support to build something in the medium or long term," the frenchman wrote in the letter published in the sports daily as.
"i am a born winner and i was here to win trophies, but beyond this there are human beings, emotions, life and i have the feeling that these things have not been valued, that it has not been understood that this is also how the dynamic of a great club is maintained," he said.
"but everything i built on a daily basis, what i brought to the relationship with the players.
.
.
has been forgotten. "
"i'm leaving, but i'm not jumping ship and i'm not tired of coaching," he said.
real had a disappointing season, finishing second in la liga behind neigbours atletico madrid and losing to eventual winners chelsea in the champions league semi-finals.
it is the second time that zidane has resigned as real madrid manager.
the 1998 world cup winner first took the helm in january 2016 and guided real to the 2017 la liga title and an unprecedented hat-trick of champions league titles before abruptly quitting on may 31, 2018. less than a year later he returned after julen lopetegui and santiago solari were sacked as managers in quick succession.
in his letter zidane said he left the club in 2018 because it needed "a different voice to keep itself at the highest" but this time "things are different".
"i want what we have achieved together to be respected.
i would have liked in recent months my relationship with the club and with the president (florentino perez) to have been a little different from that of other coaches," zidane said.
"i wasn't asking for privileges, of course not, but a little more memory," added zidane.
'always grateful' zidane's contract with real was set to expire in 2022 but he had repeatedly refused to confirm he would still be at the club next season.
he has a history of making surprise announcements: as a player, he initially announced his retirement from international football in 2004 before coming back for the 2006 world cup, after which he retired for good following his red card for butting on italy's marco materazzi as france lost the final.
"spending 20 years in madrid has been the most beautiful thing that has ever happened to me in life and i know that i owe it exclusively to florentino perez who bet on me in 2001," zidane said in the letter.
"i say it from the heart, i will always be grateful to the 'presi' for it.
always," he added.
zidane now take another break from football although there has been talk of him either taking charge of the french national team or juventus, where he spent five years as a player.
juventus are suffering financially as a result of the covid-19 pandemic and might not be in a position to entice him.
didier deschamps, who led france to victory in the last world cup,  is likely to remain national coach until the 2022 world cup in qatar, barring a disastrous performance at the european championship that kicks off next month.

log in with your social accountnaomi osaka announced she was withdrawing from the french open on monday after she was threatened with disqualification for boycotting media duties, while on court, roger federer, serena williams and iga swiatek all reached the second round.
japanese star osaka, a four-time grand slam champion, said before the tournament that she would not attend press conferences to protect her mental health, saying the traditional post-match inquests are like "kicking people when they're down".
she refused to speak to the media after her first-round victory on sunday.
the organisers of the four major tournaments -- the australian, french and us opens as well as wimbledon -- responded by fining the world number two $15,000 and threatening her with further sanctions, including defaulting her from roland garros.
but the 23-year-old said she has suffered from depression since winning her first slam in the infamous us open final three years ago against serena williams, and pulled out of the event.
"the best thing for the tournament, the other players and my well-being is that i withdraw so that everyone can get back to focusing on the tennis going on in paris," osaka wrote in a statement on twitter.
"the truth is that i have suffered long bouts of depression since the us open in 2018 and i have had a really hard time coping with that.
"osaka is one of tennis' biggest stars and the world's highest-earning female athlete.
switzerland's roger federer serves the ball to uzbekistan's denis istomin during their men's singles first round tennis match at the philippe chatrier court on day 2 of the roland garros 2021 french open tennis tournament in paris on may 31, 2021.
(afp/anne-christine poujoulat.
)on court philippe chatrier, federer kicked off only his second french open campaign in six years with an impressive dismissal of denis istomin.
the 39-year-old federer, level with rafael nadal on 20 grand slam singles titles, saw off uzbek istomin 6-2, 6-4, 6-3. federer arrived at roland garros having played only three matches since his australian open semi-final loss to novak djokovic last year, before the covid-19 pandemic hit.
the swiss great lost to pablo andujar in his first clay-court outing of the season earlier this month in geneva, but struck 48 winners as he raced to victory over istomin.
he had been keen to play down any thoughts that he can add to his 2009 roland garros title in the run-up to the tournament, but was more positive after his win.
"for me coming back after many months or over a year of rehab, the light at the end of the tunnel or the measuring stick was always can i come back to a good level against good players," said federer.
"i hope wimbledon is going to be that place.
maybe there's going to be even something here in paris.
we'll see.
"he will next face 2014 us open winner marin cilic.
serena williams of the us returns the ball to romania's irina begu during their women's singles first round tennis match at the court philippe chatrier on day 2 of the roland garros 2021 french open tennis tournament in paris on may 31, 2021.
(afp/anne-christine poujoulat)later on monday, serena williams survived a brief scare against romania's irina-camelia begu to win 7-6 (8/6), 6-2 in the first ever official french open night match.
the 39-year-old, still one behind margaret court's all-time record of 24 grand slam singles titles, saved two set points in the first-set tie-break but dominated from then on.
"it wasn't easy in that first set.
i was up and i felt like i had some opportunities," said williams, who will next face begu's compatriot mihaela buzarnescu.
the match under the lights on court philippe chatrier was played behind closed doors due to a 9pm curfew imposed by the french government due to covid-19.
defending champion swiatek, celebrating her 20th birthday, saw off her good friend kaja juvan 6-0, 7-5 on court philippe chatrier.
swiatek, who became the first grand slam singles title winner from poland last october, hit 22 winners in an impressive opening to her bid for a second straight roland garros triumph.
"i tried to put it behind me (being defending champion) and kind of use it in a positive way because i just know that i'm feeling good here," said the eighth seed.
daniil medvedev, who had lost in the first round in all of his four previous appearances in the tournament, put his poor clay-court form behind him by beating the dangerous alexander bublik 6-3, 6-3, 7-5. the two-time grand slam runner-up was too strong for kazakh bublik, setting up a second-round tie against us player tommy paul.
"it was a good match and i've been training really well," said second seed medvedev.
the russian is bidding to take advantage of being in the opposite half of the draw to 13-time champion nadal, djokovic and federer, while fourth seed dominic thiem was knocked out on sunday.
elsewhere, sixth seed bianca andreescu was dumped out after losing a marathon first-round match with slovenia's world number 85 tamara zidansek 6-7 (1/7), 7-6 (7/2), 9-7. fourth seed sofia kenin, last year's losing finalist, did battle through, though, edging out 2017 champion jelena ostapenko 6-4, 4-6, 6-3.

by richard martin for mailonline  published:  08:33 bst, 31 may 2021   |  updated:  11:43 bst, 31 may 2021    7view  commentszinedine zidane has fired back at real madrid less than a week after resigning from the club.
the french coach left the top job at the santiago bernabeu for the second time in three years when he decided to step down last thursday, days after the club ended the season without a trophy for the first time in 11 years.
he had stayed silent on social media and in the media since leaving but he has come out swinging in an open letter to fans published in newspaper as.
zinedine zidane has lifted the lid on his departure from real madrid after resigning last weekzidane said real president florentino perez did not 'give me the support i needed''i'm leaving but i'm not abandoning the ship and i'm not tired of coaching,' he wrote.
'in may 2018 i left because after two and a half years of so many victories and trophies i felt the team needed a new plan to stay at the highest level.
today things are different.
'i'm leaving because i feel that the club didn't give me the support i needed, it didn't offer me the support the construct a project for the medium or long term. '
zidane departs real for the second time as one of their greatest ever coaches, winning an unprecedented three consecutive champions leagues between 2016 and 2018 plus the 2017 laliga title and two fifa club world cups.
zidane led real to the laliga title last year but ended this campaign without a trophythe frenchman restored real to the greatest heights after a poor spell under rafael benitez and they were in even greater disarray after his shock resignation in may 2018, days after his side had beaten liverpool 3-1 in the champions league final in kiev.
julen lopetegui was sacked in october after his sensational departure from the spain team on the eve of the 2018 world cup and successor santiago solari did not last long either, being moved on the following march.
faced with another crisis, real again turned to the smiling frenchman, who got off to a slow start and was close to being booted out after a humiliating 3-0 defeat to paris saint-germain.
but he turned things around and proved himself as a top man-manager after the three month break due to the coronavirus pandemic, overseeing real's surge to the laliga title by winning 10 games in a row to overhaul leaders barcelona.
zidane (pictured with perez) won three consecutive champions leagues as real madrid coachhe also built up a great relationship with the players, which he felt wasn't properly appreciatedbut zidane felt he was not given the tools he needed to consolidate that success and build for the future.
and he felt the hard work he had done in building a rapport with the players was not being properly appreciated.
'i understand football and know the demands of a club like real madrid, i know that when you don't win things you have to leave.
but here they have forgotten something very important, they have forgotten everything we built each day, everything i contributed to the relationship with the players, with the 150 people who work with and around the team,' he added.
'i'm a natural winner and i was here to win trophies but beyond that you have human beings, emotions and life and i got the impression that these things were not being appreciated, and people forgot that's how you maintain the dynamic of a great club.
i even felt in a certain way that i was being reproached.
'dear madridistas,for the last 20 years, ever since the first day i stepped my foot down in the city of madrid and put on the white shirt i've felt your affection.
i've always felt there was something very special between us.
i've had the great honour of being a player and coach of the most important club of all-time, but first of all i'm a madridista like the rest of you.
that's why i wanted to write this letter to you to say goodbye to you all and explain my decision to step down as coach.
when in march 2019 i accepted the offer to return to real madrid after eight months of rest it was because florentino perez asked me to, of course, but it was also because you fans asked me to do so every day.
whenever i ran into a real madrid fan on the street i felt the support and desire to see me with the team again.
because i share the values of madridismo, this club owned by its members, its fans, by everyone.
i've tried to transmit this values in everything i've done, i've always tried to be an example.
spending 20 years at real madrid is the most beautiful thing that has happened in my life and i owe everything exclusively to florentino perez, who bet on me in 2001, who fought for me, to make me come to the club when certain people were against it.
i say this from the bottom of my hear, i'll always be grateful to the president for that.
always.
now i've decided to leave and i wanted to explain to you well my reasons.
i'm leaving but i'm not abandoning the ship and i'm not tired of coaching.
in may 2018 i left because after two and a half years of so many victories and trophies i felt the team needed a new plan to stay at the highest level.
today things are different.
i'm leaving because i feel that the club didn't give me the support i needed, it didn't offer me the support the construct a project for the medium or long term.
i understand football and know the demands of a club like real madrid, i know that when you don't win things you have to leave.
but here they have forgotten something very important, they have forgotten everything we built each day, everything i contributed to the relationship with the players, with the 150 people who work with and around the team.
i'm a natural winner and i was here to win trophies but beyond that you have human beings, emotions and life and i got the impression that these things were not being appreciated, and people forgot that's how you maintain the dynamic of a great club.
i even felt in a certain way that i was being reproached.
i want people to respect what everyone together achieved.
i would have liked my relationship with the club and the president in the last few months to have been a little different to that of other coaches.
i didn't ask for privileges, of course not, just for people to have better memories.
these days, the lifespan of a coach at a big club is around two years, not much more.
to last longer human relations are essential, they are more important than money, more important than reputation, more important than anything.
you have to look after them.
that's why it hurt so much when i read in the press, after one defeat, that i was going to be sacked if i didn't win the next game.
it hurt me and all my team because these messages that were intentionally leaked to the media created negative feelings with the squad, they created doubts and misunderstandings.
at least i had some marvellous lads that would stand with me until death.
when things got ugly they saved me with great victories.
because they believed in me and they knew i believed in them.
of course i'm not the best coach in the world, but i'm capable of giving each one the strength and confidence they need at work, be they players, coaching staff or any employee.
i know perfectly well what a team needs.
in the roughly 20 years i've spent at real madrid i've learned that you guys, the fans, you want to win, of course.
but above all you want us, the coach, the staff, the workers and of course the footballers, to give everything.
and i can assure you that we gave 100% of ourselves for the club.
i also want to use this letter to send a message to the journalists.
i've done hundreds of press conferences and unfortunately we've spoken very little about football and i know you love football too, this sport which unites us all.
however, without wanting to criticise you or give lessons i would have liked it if your questions weren't always directed towards controversy, i would have liked us to talk more about the ball and above all the players, who are and always will be the most important thing in this game.
let's not forget about football, let's look after football.
dear madridistas, i'll always be one of you.

pep guardiola lost the champions league final in the only way that he knows how.
manchester city's manager waited an entire decade to again reach the showpiece of europe's elite club competition, just to get inside his own head once he was there.
guardiola did not blow the chance to claim his third continental crown yesterday morning (singapore time); he surrendered it before the final against chelsea even began.
the english premier league champions tried to spring a surprise on their west london counterparts by throwing caution to the wind with a midfield devoid of enforcement, for the first time since november's win over olympiakos in a group-stage dead rubber.
instead, omitting both fernandinho and rodri from their starting line-up handed thomas tuchel's side the easiest roadmap to follow to a 1-0 victory in porto.
while guardiola tinkered with a previously reliable formula one which saw city stroll to the epl title at a relative canter the blues were able to cut through their opponents at will.
tuchel refused to pander to the convention that deploying two ball-winning midfielders on the biggest stage is an act of heresy.
guardiola himself produced his most sparkling managerial displays with xavi hernandez and andres iniesta occupying a double pivot at barcelona.
but city using no holding players whatsoever was an act that bordered on self-sabotage and allowed n'golo kante to hoover up the play as well as the man of the match award.
something curious seems to happen to guardiola whenever immortality beckons in the champions league.
his coaching career has become so heavily entwined with it yet, no matter how much the stars align, he still somehow manages to deviate off-course.
tried-and-tested methods go out the window once the ultimate prize draws tantalisingly close.
it happened in a succession of quarter-final exits, including 310km south of the estadio do dragao last summer as lyon bypassed city's defence-heavy outfit in lisbon.
packing the attack rather than his backline was guardiola's biggest blunder on this latest occasion.
he sacrificed the core principles of city's well-oiled machine to pursue a utopian vision of winning through the merits of raw creativity and reckless abandon.
remarkably, he made the same mistake that had led to his crowning glory after sir alex ferguson recently lamented his failure to shackle park ji -sung to lionel messi in 2011. manchester united's grandmaster realised the error of his ways after just 10 minutes at wembley as he watched the south korea international largely chasing shadows.
guardiola, too, will appreciate the gift of hindsight after trying to outsmart the game plan of an opposite number whose philosophy is heavily aligned to his own and has successfully overcome the city boss three times in the past six weeks alone.
critical thinking hinders him as much as jose mourinho is by his own petulance.
repeating the flaw at the same stadium that his eternal nemesis forged one of the champions league's most unlikely winners is an irony which will not be lost on many.
guardiola's standing as the finest coach of his generation is indisputable.
anyone with 26 major honours in 12 seasons cannot be considered anything else.
unless he arrests the second-guessing, however, the champions league will continue to elude both himself and the etihad stadium's all-star cast for years to come.
man city: ederson, walker, stones, dias, zinchenko, guendogan, silva (fernandinho 64), foden, mahrez, de bruyne (jesus 60), sterling (aguero 77)chelsea: mendy, azpilicueta, silva (christensen 39), ruediger, james, kante, jorginho, chilwell, havertz, mount (kovacic 80), werner (pulisic 66)on christmas eve last year, thomas tuchel was sacked as paris saint-germain coach.
barely six months later, the german has the last laugh as he reached the pinnacle of european club football with chelsea by defeating pep guardiola's manchester city 1-0 in the final.
it was tuchel's third win over guardiola's english premier league champions in six weeks, following last month's 1-0 fa cup semi-final victory and the 2-1 away epl win at the etihad earlier this month.
kai havertz struck shortly before half-time, picking up mason mount's through-ball and rounding city goalkeeper ederson for the winner, as city looked like a pale shadow of themselves.
former arsenal manager arsene wenger said tuchel had pipped guardiola in the tactical battle.
"i must say that what tuchel did well is that he played mount and havertz more inside defensively," the frenchman told bein sports.
"so manchester city could never find a way through the middle and had to go wide where chelsea were quite strong tonight.
"manchester city had a big tactical problem they could not sort out.
"they're not balanced, they did not find a way to play incisive football and chelsea stopped them very well.
"wenger also praised chelsea midfielder n'golo kante, who had also put in title-winning performances with the 2015/16 epl-winning leicester city side and the 2018 world cup winners france.
former chelsea midfielder joe cole, speaking on bt sport, is another admirer of kante.
"i played (at chelsea) with (french international) claude makelele, who i thought was the best until i saw this kid.
he's got makelele plus extras," he added.
"(city's ilkay) guendogan, (bernardo) silva and (phil) foden couldn't read it, kante was just on it.
"city fans, though, would be scratching their heads wondering why guardiola started without either of his holding midfielders fernandinho and rodri, something he had rarely done.
instead, he deployed guendogan just in front of the back four, a move that backfired and led to criticism of his over-tinkering.
"i think that will be levelled at him because he changed the way he had played all season.
he has always had rodri or fernandinho in there but he changed it," said former england defender rio ferdinand.
"we know tactically he tinkers, he might have seen a weakness in there, but thomas tuchel nullified any threat.
"we saw riyad mahrez and raheem sterling played really wide, they've not really done that this season and maybe that is something city did wrong," he added.
guardiola insisted that his selections had been designed to overcome the blues.
"i picked the best selection to win the game and the players know it," he said.
"i think guendogan played good, but we missed a little bit to break the lines in the first half.
the second half was much better.
"while guardiola rues his mistake , tuchel is already eyeing an extension of his 18-month contract and his rivalry with the catalan.
when asked about meeting chelsea owner roman abramovich, tuchel said: "i am looking forward to this.
i can assure him that i will stay hungry.
that i want the next title. "

2 naomi osaka was yesterday threatened with disqualification from the french open if she continues her media boycott, officials said.
the japanese star, who was fined us$15,000 (s$20,000) for skipping the news conference after her first-round victory at roland garros, could also face suspension from other grand slam tournaments, the board added.
she lived up to her vow of not attending a post-match press conference while at the french open yesterday for the sake of her "mental health" but she did at least speak briefly to the media on court.
the 23-year-old opened the first day of action at roland garros with a 6-4, 7-6 (7-4) first-round victory over romanian patricia maria tig, ranked 61 places below her.
she later said she would maintain her media boycott and would instead let her racket do the talking at the french open.
the four-time grand slam title winner has sparked controversy after refusing to carry out media obligations at the year's second major, claiming post-match conferences were akin to "kicking people when they're down".
osaka only agreed to take part in a cursory on-court tv interview before walking off and is looking at a fine of up to us$20,000 for every news conference she skips.
she has wished for the total sum to be donated to mental health charities but the international tennis federation has confirmed all fines go towards the development of the game.
"for me, playing on clay is a work in progress," said the reigning us and australian open champion, who has never won a wta title on the surface and has never gotten past the third round here, on a sun-kissed court philippe chatrier.
"hopefully, the more i play, the better i will become.
it's a beautiful court.
"she will face another romanian in ana bogdan tomorrow.
in the men's draw, two-time runner-up dominic thiem was knocked out by spanish journeyman pablo andujar 4-6, 5-7, 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 in the first major upset of the clay-court grand slam.
thiem said: "i was not struggling with my motivation.
the game was just not there today.
the shots are not powerful enough, not accurate enough, not moving well enough.
.
.
it's not the real me or the version that can play for big titles.
"in beating the reigning us open champion, andujar, 35, claimed his biggest career scalp.
the world no.
68 has been in giant-killing form of late, upsetting 20-time major winner roger federer of switzerland at the geneva open earlier this month.
he said: "it's a very special moment because i'm 35 and i don't know how long i'm going to play.
i had to believe to be able to get this result.
it was very difficult, in the third set he wasn't quite as strong.
"the other notable upset of the day saw former world no.
1 angelique kerber beaten 6-2, 6-4 by ukrainian qualifier anhelina kalinina.
the german has never made it past the quarter-finals here despite winning the other three slams once each and her wretched record in paris never looked like improving, suffering her third opening loss in a row.
kerber, who has dropped to world no.
27 after poor form over the past two-plus years, just wants to put the french open behind her and focus on the upcoming grass-court swing, which is better suited for her counter-punching style.
"i will try to learn from the match now because i played well the last few weeks and i had good matches," she said.

madrid: zinedine zidane said on monday he had stepped down as real madrid coach as the club's hierarchy did not have enough faith in him to rebuild an ageing squad.
zidane, who returned to real for a second spell in charge in march 2019, won two la liga titles and three champions league crowns during his two stints as coach.
however, he stepped down last week after real suffered their first trophyless season in 11 years, finishing second in la liga, being knocked out of the champions league semi-finals and suffering a humiliating copa del rey exit in the round of 32 to third division minnows alcoyano.
in an open letter published in sports daily as, zidane said the first time he left as coach in 2018 was because he felt the team needed a new approach to stay at the highest level after enjoying so much success.
"right now, things are different," he said.
"i'm leaving because i feel the club no longer has the faith in me i need, nor the support to build something in the medium or long term.
"zidane also suggested that his relationship with the club president had changed in recent weeks, and hit out at the series of leaks and stories about his future coming from within real.
"i would have liked my relationship with the club and the president over the past few months to have been a little different to that of other coaches," he added.
"i wasn't asking for privileges, of course not, just a little more recollection.
"it hurt me so much when i read in the press, after a defeat, that i would be sacked if i didn't win the next game.
"it hurt me and the whole team because these deliberately leaked messages to the media negatively influenced the squad, they created doubts and misunderstandings.

madrid, may 31 ‚Äî  zinedine zidane resigned as real madrid manager because he felt the spanish club no longer had any confidence in him, he wrote in an open letter today.
"i'm leaving because i feel the club no longer has the faith in me i need, and doesn't offer me the support to build something in the medium or long term," the frenchman wrote in the letter published in the sports daily as.
"i am a born winner and i was here to win trophies, but beyond this there are human beings, emotions, life and i have the feeling that these things have not been valued, that it has not been understood that this is also how the dynamic of a great club is maintained," he said.
"but everything i built on a daily basis, what i brought to the relationship with the players.
.
.
has been forgotten. "
"i'm leaving, but i'm not jumping ship and i'm not tired of coaching," he said.
real had a disappointing season, finishing second in la liga behind neigbours atletico madrid and losing to eventual winners chelsea in the champions league semi-finals.
it is the second time that zidane has resigned as real madrid manager.
the 1998 world cup winner first took the helm in january 2016 and guided real to the 2017 la liga title and an unprecedented hat-trick of champions league titles before abruptly quitting on may 31, 2018. less than a year later he returned after julen lopetegui and santiago solari were sacked as managers in quick succession.
in his letter zidane said he left the club in 2018 because it needed "a different voice to keep itself at the highest" but this time "things are different".
"i want what we have achieved together to be respected.
i would have liked in recent months my relationship with the club and with the president (florentino perez) to have been a little different from that of other coaches," zidane said.
"i wasn't asking for privileges, of course not, but a little more memory," added zidane.
'always grateful' zidane's contract with real was set to expire in 2022 but he had repeatedly refused to confirm he would still be at the club next season.
he has a history of making surprise announcements: as a player, he initially announced his retirement from international football in 2004 before coming back for the 2006 world cup, after which he retired for good following his red card for butting on italy's marco materazzi as france lost the final.
"spending 20 years in madrid has been the most beautiful thing that has ever happened to me in life and i know that i owe it exclusively to florentino perez who bet on me in 2001," zidane said in the letter.
"i say it from the heart, i will always be grateful to the 'presi' for it.
always," he added.
zidane now take another break from football although there has been talk of him either taking charge of the french national team or juventus, where he spent five years as a player.
juventus are suffering financially as a result of the covid-19 pandemic and might not be in a position to entice him.
didier deschamps, who led france to victory in the last world cup,  is likely to remain national coach until the 2022 world cup in qatar, barring a disastrous performance at the european championship that kicks off next month.

paris: japanese superstar naomi osaka was on sunday (may 30) threatened with disqualification from the french open if she persists with her controversial media boycott, officials said.
"we have advised naomi osaka that should she continue to ignore her media obligations, she would be exposing herself to possible further code of conduct infringement consequences," said a statement from the four grand slam tournaments after issuing the world number two with a us$15,000 fine.
"as might be expected, repeat violations attract tougher sanctions including default from the tournament.
"osaka, a four-time grand slam title winner and sport's highest-earning female athlete, was fined for refusing to hold a press conference after her opening 6-4, 7-6 (7/4) victory over romanian world number 63 patricia maria tig.
the 23-year-old had said on the eve of the tournament that she would refuse to carry out any media obligations, claiming news conferences are detrimental to her mental health.
she believes traditional post-match inquests are akin to "kicking people when they're down".
however, the four grand slam events wimbledon, the french, australian and us opens issued a joint statement, saying they had written to osaka "to check on her well-being and offer support".
"she was also reminded of her obligations, the consequences of not meeting them and that rules should equally apply to all players.
"naomi osaka today chose not to honour her contractual media obligations.
the roland garros referee has therefore issued her a us$15,000 fine.
"after her match on sunday, osaka agreed only to a cursory on-court tv interview.
"for me, playing on clay is a work in progress," said the reigning us and australian open champion on a sun-kissed court philippe chatrier.
"hopefully the more i play, the better i will become.
"and that was that from a player who has now strung together 15 successive grand slam match wins.
osaka, who has never got past the third round in paris, fired 39 winners but committed 35 unforced errors against tig to set up a second round duel against another romanian player, ana bogdan.
"honour commitments"the grand slam heads also said osaka's refusal to take part in media duties put opponents at a disadvantage.
"there is nothing more important than ensuring no player has an unfair advantage over another, which unfortunately is the case in this situation if one player refuses to dedicate time to participate in media commitments while the others all honour their commitments.
"if osaka was to be disqualified, it would be as infamous as novak djokovic's default at last year's us open where the world number was booted out for hitting a line judge with a ball.
osaka's defiant stand overshadowed the opening day of the 2021 french open.
petra kvitova, a semi-finalist in 2012 and 2020, saved a match point before seeing off belgian qualifier greet minnen, 6-7 (3/7), 7-6 (7-5), 6-1. the 11th seeded czech, a two-time wimbledon champion, blitzed 43 winners but served up 11 double faults against her 125th-ranked opponent.
fresh from her first career clay court title in madrid, belarusian third seed aryna sabalenka eased past croatian qualifier ana konjuh 6-4, 6-3. three-time major winner angelique kerber, the german 26th seed and twice a quarter-finalist in paris, lost to ukrainian qualifier anhelina kalinina 6-2, 6-4. the win was a 14th successive win for the world number 139 kalinina across all tournaments.
later sunday, men's world number five stefanos tsitsipas faces home player jeremy chardy.
the greek is widely tipped as a potential champion should 13-time winner rafael nadal or world number one novak djokovic falter.
tsitsipas has already captured the monte carlo masters and lyon titles on clay this season.
crowd limitesalso in action sunday is fourth seed dominic thiem, the 2018 and 2019 runner-up to nadal.
us open champion thiem faces spanish veteran pablo andujar who defeated roger federer on clay in geneva last week.
in total, just over 5,000 spectators a day will be admitted at the roland garros site until june 8 under covid-19 limits.
that figure will then rise to more than 13,000 a day thanks to the government's decision to raise fan numbers to a 65 per cent limit of capacity.
the main setback for organisers, however, is that nine of their scheduled 10 evening sessions an innovation for 2021 will be played behind closed doors.

editions:en/football/real-madridraul varela gives his opinionjust when lionel messi's burofax seemed like being the most talked-about document in spanish football's recent history, zinedine zidane writes an eye-raising open letter revealing the reasons why he has left real madrid for a third time.
zidane writes this letter with a grin as sharp as the knife he uses to stab real madrid and, especially, their president and his friend, florentino perez, in the back.
a lack of confidence and retrospect, leaks, little support and the absence of a project.
.
.
he leaves nothing that happened in his final few months of the club to the imagination, all while he was aiming for success in laliga santander and the champions league, although the trophy cabinet didn't open so easily this time.
florentino must now decide whether he's going to hide behind a superficial club statement, like the one that was sent out to communicate zidane's exit after a 30-minute meeting, or whether he's going to, like with the european super league, come out and explain the reasons why a club icon like the frenchman, a key figure in the most successful era in the club's history who the president admires greatly, has decided to leave his post.
this time, zidane has spoken his mind and shared, via the press who he also attacks for their questions and search for controversy, his version of events.
these events piled up at real madrid over the course of a few weeks that saw them scrape through the champions league group stages, get humiliated by alcoyano in the copa del rey and face a mountain to climb in catching up with the leaders in laliga santander, plus the difficulty in managing a trimmed first-team squad.
the season ended with the side runners-up in the league and reaching the last four of the easy side of the champions league draw.
zidane's exit from real madrid seems like, with the passing of time, a necessary evil.
the club decided to go down a different path.
it was a failure on two fronts the club for not knowing how to please the best coach in their history and the best coach in their history for not knowing how to adapt for what was to come.
maybe the arrival of kylian mbappe would be the best medicine for this incipient headache, but all the pride that comes with getting through such a tough season has been eradicated by a letter.
zidane's letter.

porto, portugal (afp) kevin de bruyne is a major doubt for belgium's euro 2020 campaign after suffering two facial fractures in manchester city's champions league final defeat by chelsea on saturday (may 29).
the 29-year-old midfielder was helped off the field in tears after colliding with antonio rudiger on the hour mark in porto and his left eye immediately appeared swollen.
without his creativity, chelsea comfortably held out for a 1-0 win to keep city waiting for champions league glory.
"just got back from the hospital," de bruyne posted on his twitter account on sunday.
"my diagnosis is acute nose bone fracture and left orbital fracture.
i feel okay now.
still disappointed about yesterday obviously but we will be back.
"belgium's first match of the postponed euro is on june 12 against russia in saint petersburg.
roberto martinez's team then face denmark and finland in what should be a comfortable group b for the top-ranked side in the world.
meanwhile, thierry henry is rejoining belgium's coaching staff for the euro where he will serve again as one of martinez's assistants, the belgian football association said on sunday.
henry, 43, worked on martinez's staff from mid-2016 until just after the world cup in russia, where belgium finished third.
the former france world cup winner then went to monaco as coach and later to montreal impact in major league soccer before returning to working as a television pundit in britain.

other english editionsshortly after the full-time whistle blew in porto on saturday night, kai havertz was asked about the massive transfer fee which had appeared to hang heavily around his neck all season long.
"i don't give a f*ck now!"
chelsea's ¬£70 million ($99m) signing told bt sport.
"we've won the f*cking champions league!
"indeed, with his very first goal in the tournament, havertz has already secured legendary status at stamford bridge.
it had been a tough first season in england for the former bayer leverkusen attacker, arguably the toughest of his fledgling career to date.
he arrived touted as the most exciting young player to come out of germany for years but the 21-year-old, perhaps unsurprisingly, took time to get going and sparkled only sporadically.
contracting coronavirus hadn't helped his period of adaptation to a new team, club and country, while the manager who signed him, frank lampard, was dismissed midway through the campaign.
it was thought that the arrival of thomas tuchel would result in an immediate return to form but havertz was never a certain starter under his fellow german.
however, tuchel backed him in the biggest game of the season and havertz came up trumps.
in front of a crowd of 14,000 people at the estadio do dragao, which included chelsea owner roman abramovich, he showed exactly why the blues were so determined to acquire him.
darting through the middle of the pitch, havertz latched onto mason mount's through ball and rounded manchester city goalkeeper ederson to score what proved the only goal of a tight and tense all-english champions league final.
havertz should have ended the game with an assist, too, but after brilliantly teeing up christian pulisic in the second half, the american dragged his dinked finish wide of the goal.
in the end, it mattered not.
havertz's solitary strike proved sufficient to see off city and he was a deserved match-winner.
he didn't just cause problems in attack, as he also helped out his defence by tracking back repeatedly during the second half.
of course, to beat a pep guardiola side, you need a complete team display and that's what chelsea produced in portugal.
tactically, technically and mentally, they were immaculate throughout, combining quality with work-rate.
andreas christensen had to come on for an injured thiago silva and helped deliver yet another clean sheet.
as far as the dane is concerned, tuchel deserves a significant slice of the credit for chelsea's transformation into one of the toughest teams to break down in europe.
"you guys can see he is very passionate on the sidelines," christiansen told reporters.
"also, just the things we are trying to do are more german.
it's hard to explain but it's the feeling you get and is good for me personally.
"he's been trying to get his ideas across, and not just from a defensive perspective.
he's been trying to get loads of ideas in our heads but, at the same time, he doesn't do too much because otherwise, it would get complicated.
"he deserves credit but the players do as well for taking on so much information on board so quickly and making it work.
"it's undoubtedly been a team effort, with the manager and his players performing in unison.
how else to explain their dramatic change of fortune since january?
or the fact that they managed to overcome a city side that were heavy favourites to win their first champions league title.
instead, it was chelsea who claimed their second, and deservedly so.
whereas the blues rose to the occasion, the premier league champions panicked.
perhaps even guardiola was affected by the pressure.
he once again seemed to overthink his team selection and ended up losing to tuchel for the third time in a row.
the former paris saint-germain coach had been hired shortly after city ripped chelsea apart at stamford bridge.
however, in his first meeting with guardiola, he masterminded a 2-1 fa cup semi-final win over the catalan, and followed up with a vital premier league victory at the etihad stadium.
this win in porto, though, ranks as the biggest triumph of all, a beautiful testament to the strong bond he so quickly formed with his players.
"he's honest," right-back reece james told reporters matter-of-factly.
"he believes in us and that we can win many trophies and titles together.
"they've now claimed the biggest one of all, and against the man considered the best coach in the game today.
tuchel's two previous victories over guardiola had been dismissed by some because the city boss hadn't fielded his strongest line-up in either game.
however, with both managers having full panels to choose from at the dragao, tuchel once again came out on top.
chelsea claimed the european crown city thought they were destined to win.
now, tuchel's team look perfectly poised to take their english title away from them too.

other english editionsliverpool have triggered the release clause in ibrahima konate's contract at rb leipzig, with a five-year contract agreed with the french defender.
the 22-year-old has been heavily linked with the reds for some time, and a big-money move to england has now been pushed through.
a long-term deal has been agreed with the highly-rated defender and he is all set to open a new chapter in his career at anfield.
upon completing a switch to england, konate told the reds' official website: "i'm really happy to be joining such a massive club like liverpool.
"it's a really exciting moment for me and my family and i am really looking forward to meeting my new team-mates, the staff and getting started on this new chapter.
"right now, my focus is on the u21 european championships with france, but after this competition i know i will be joining one of the best teams in the world and that gives me a great feeling.
"i have worked very hard for many years to get to this point, but i would like to say a big thank you to everyone at rb leipzig and all the people i worked with there ‚Äì the coaches, my team-mates, the staff and especially the fans.
"your support helped me grow up during my time there and become not only a better player, but a better man and i will always be grateful for it.

all of the relevant paperwork is now in place, with signatures added where required.
a medical has also been completed, with a top target snapped up early in the summer by jurgen klopp.
klopp saw best-laid plans decimated by injuries in 2020-21, with his defensive ranks feeling the full force of those blows.
virgil van dijk, joe gomez and joel matip were among those to take in lengthy spells on the sidelines, forcing academy graduates to be promoted and fresh faces to be drafted in.
ozan kabak was among those acquired in january, in a loan agreement with schalke, but an ¬£18m ($26m) purchase option will not be taken up there.
with konate on his way to merseyside, klopp must now decide what to do with a number of other options at his disposal.
rhys williams and nat phillips impressed during a late surge for champions league qualification, but could both be loaned out in 2021-22, while a decision also needs to be made on the future of winter arrival ben davies who is yet to take in an appearance for the club.
konate has figured prominently on klopp's recruitment radar ever since the decision was taken to bring in another centre-half.
alternative options were, however, mulled over, with liverpool eager to ensure that they were not solely reliant on plan a. brighton defender ben white, who has made england's preliminary squad for this summer's european championship, is another that the reds considered, along with marseille star duje caleta-car.

date published: friday 28th may 2021 1:23               samuel bannister ibrahima konate will become a liverpool player on july 1st after the club officially confirmed they have reached an agreement to sign him.
konate has been linked heavily with liverpool in recent months as they look to strengthen in defence.
he has risen to prominence with rb leipzig and is a france under-21 international.
a release clause in his contract made him available for an inviting fee and liverpool have taken advantage.
it emerged earlier on friday that the reds had triggered his release clause and confirmation would arrive imminently.
now, that confirmation has come.
the premier league giants have revealed that konate has passed a medical and signed a long-term contract.
the defender told their club website: "i'm really happy to be joining such a massive club like liverpool.
"it's a really exciting moment for me and my family and i am really looking forward to meeting my new teammates, the staff and getting started on this new chapter.

konate spent four years with leipzig but will now move to the premier league for the first time.
the 22-year-old will hope to resolve some of the defensive issues that have plagued liverpool in recent months.
the reds signed ozan kabak on loan in january to provide cover but have decided against signing him permanently, instead swooping for konate.
manager jurgen klopp is excited to be able to work with long-term target konate.
he added: "i'm really pleased we've been able to add a player of ibrahima's quality to our squad and he is someone i've admired for a long time, ever since i first became aware of his potential when he was at sochaux.
"after the problems we had with injuries in the centre-half position last season, there's no doubt it was clear it was an area of the team we needed to strengthen.
but i first have to say that the job nat [phillips], rhys [williams] and ozan did was incredible.
unbelievable really.
"in ibrahima we are signing a player who will add to the quality we already have here.
his physical attributes are very impressive; he is quick, he is very strong and he is dominant in the air.
"he comes to us after playing more than 90 times for leipzig in the bundesliga and european football.
i'm sure that number would have been more but for some injury.
but even so that means he already has experience of what it takes to compete in two outstandingly difficult competitions.
"he also played for a team in the champions league in high-pressure matches, who have a similar football vision to ourselves.
"i am confident we are signing a player who can play for us right away.
but he is a boy of 22 years of age who has room to improve because of his massive potential.
i know that's something he is eager to work on with us to become an even better player.
"for me, that's really exciting because i have seen how good he is already and i'm looking forward to working with him when he joins up with us in pre-season.

com: as a deal for ibrahima konate nears completion, we assess how he compares to liverpool's alternative centre-back targets.
sign up to receive the best lfc opinion direct to your inboxalong with the news that liverpool are on the brink of completing a ¬£35m deal for rb leipzig defender ibrahima konate, which could officially be announced within the next couple of days, it has emerged that liverpool were also considering two other players as alternative centre-back targets before settling on the frenchman as their priority.
marseille's duje caleta-car and villarreal's pau torres were also on the shortlist, according to various  reports, with liverpool having been keen to bring in the former in the january transfer window, only for a ¬£20m deal to be scuppered by marseille not having enough time to find a replacement of their own.
why, then, was konate chosen ahead of the other two to bolster j√ºrgen klopp's defensive options for next season and beyond?in terms of pass completion, they're all fairly similar based on their statistics from the 2020/21 campaign: konate with 86.
4%, caleta-car with 86.
9% and torres a little further ahead with 89.
2%.
torres is noticeably superior when it comes to progressive passes (defined as any pass which moves the ball at least 10 yards from its furthest point in the last six passes, excluding passes in the defensive 40% of the pitch, or any pass into the opposition penalty area), averaging 4.
18 per 90, versus 2.
85 for konate and 2.
62 for caleta-car.
konate, though, is much more adept at carrying the ball forward with driving runs than he is in terms of his passing ability at this point in his career.
on average, he carried the ball 212 yards towards the opponent's goal per game last season, which puts him in the 96th percentile of all bundesliga centre-backs in this metric.
that's almost double caleta-car's progressive carrying average of 107 yards, and marginally behind torres' average of 218. konate is also an exceptional dribbler, ranking in the 91st percentile of all bundesliga centre-backs for successful take-ons and the 85th percentile for dribble success last season, so his ability to launch attacks in this way will bring a great deal to liverpool's build-up play ‚Äì something which joe gomez and joel matip also excel in, while virgil van dijk is the outstanding long-range passer of liverpool's current centre-backs.
when it comes to aerial duels, konate performs very well, winning 75% on average (in the 94th percentile of bundesliga centre-backs), slightly below caleta-car (77.
7%) but way above torres (60.
6%), which may go some way to explaining why liverpool didn't go for the spaniard despite his excellent on-the-ball numbers.
in addition, konate is the tallest of the trio, standing at 6ft 4in, versus caleta-car (6ft 2in) and torres (6ft 3in), as well as being the youngest of the lot, having only just turned 22 this week, compared to the other two who are both 24.  despite his physical stature, konate is also extremely quick, which, given the high defensive line liverpool tend to play, is a hugely valuable attribute.
overall, therefore, while torres is the most accomplished in possession-based statistics and caleta-car is the strongest in the air, konate offers an excellent blend of qualities which perhaps makes him the most well-rounded of the three, while still having so much scope for further development.
concerns over his injury record also have seem to have been alleviated following a medical examination.
for ¬£35m, liverpool have taken decisive action to safeguard the future of their defence for many years to come, with konate's arrival also taking some of the pressure off van dijk, gomez and matip on their road to recovery.
