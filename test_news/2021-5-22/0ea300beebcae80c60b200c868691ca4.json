Kindly know that we are after the safety of everyone,” he added.The shrine features life-size sculptures of the 14 Stations of the Cross and is one of the popular Lenten destinations in the province.During Holy Week, thousands of pilgrims from different provinces visit the site to pray.The bishop asked the faithful to instead pray the Station of the Cross with their respected families at home or privately.People, he said, may also join the parishes and communities that offer online Via Crucis.“We can still observe the Lenten discipline of prayer by participating in the actual Masses in our parishes, faithful recitation of the Holy Rosary and offering personal prayers,” Baylon said.“In this way, we continue to make our Lenten journey solemn and meaningful,” he added.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "URL": "https://mb.com.ph/2021/03/25/prelate-orders-temporary-closure-of-2-pilgrimage-sites-in-albay/", "MainKeyWord": "Hong Kong", "AdditionalKeyWord": "viet Nam", "Source": "MB"}
