{"Type": "article", "Time": "2019-01-22", "Headline": "Coming soon: 14 Asia hotels we can't wait to check into in 2019", "Text": "It's quite the cocktail.  With more than half the planet's population, massive infrastructure projects and rapid growth in air connectivity, the Asia-Pacific region is attracting more international tourists than any other part of the world.  The UNWTO puts the total tourism earnings from Asian countries at a cool US$390 billion, much of which comes from the hotel sector.  No surprise, then, that pretty much every Asia-Pacific destination you can think of seems to be opening new places to stay. We've already told you about the recent openings we're excited about.  Now, here are some of the hottest new spots around the region due to open -- and in one case, reopen -- for business in 2019. Raffles Hotel, Singapore Arguably one of the most famous names in Asian hospitality, Raffles Hotel Singapore is set to re-open in mid-2019 following an extensive top-to-bottom renovation.  New features include dining concepts by globally renowned celebrity chefs like Alain Ducasse, new categories of suites and a brand new Raffles Spa. There's 24-hour butler service and a Singapore Sling cocktail served to all guests on arrival, while a History Gallery illustrates the property's heritage dating back to 1887. Raffles Hotel Singapore has begun accepting suite reservations. Raffles Hotel Singapore, 1 Beach Rd, Singapore; +65 6337 1886 The Barracks Hotel, Singapore Another heritage building in Singapore undergoing a meticulous restoration is a former military outpost dating back to 1904.

One key feature is set to be their pool -- always a welcome feature in a tropical climate -- which sits amid their tranquil gardens. Ground floor suites have direct access for taking a dip. The Barracks Hotel, 2 Gunner Lane, Sentosa Island, Singapore; +65 6512 2202  Capella Bangkok Bangkok is one of the world's greatest hotel cities, offering rooms at every conceivable price point.

The nine acre waterside site will host an architecturally striking property designed to integrate seamlessly into the landscape. With 299 keys -- that's rooms and suites to those not in the industry -- the property is positioning itself as an urban resort experience.

Eight dining concepts and a spa are set to make the property as popular with locals as with visitors. Rosewood Hong Kong, Victoria Dockside, 18 Salisbury Road, Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon, Hong Kong; +852 3891 8888 Hoshinoya Guguan, Taiwan The traditional ryokan inn has been welcoming Japanese travelers for centuries, but Hoshinoya has made a name for itself by offering a contemporary take on these gracious accommodation options.
